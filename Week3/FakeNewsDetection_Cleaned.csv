"DISGUSTING VIDEO EMERGES of LIBERAL ACTOR, and Democrat Donor, Ben Affleck That Should Have Ended His Career","Liberal actor and close friend of Hillary Clinton, Ben Affleck, came out with a statement of disappointment over another one of his close friends, the disgraced sexual predator, and Hollywood kingpin producer, Harvey Weinstein.After Affleck released his statement of shock over the Weinstein allegations, he was quickly shot down by actress Rose McGowan who claimed he knew all about Harvey Weinstein s antics, despite his statement of fake outrage and disgust.

Hilarie Burton (@HilarieBurton) October 11, 2017And now this An embarrassing video was recently released showing actor Ben Affleck with a TV host on his lap during an interview.  The interview starts with the female host sitting on the lap of and facing Affleck, as he appears to be pulling her into him. When the female host wrests her way forward for the interview, Affleck tells her,  They would like it better if you did the show topless.  After moaning, he then asks her,  You usually show a lot more cleavage than this. What s the story?  The host giggles nervously and replies,  It s Sunday morning.  Affleck replies to the female host,  It s Sunday morning. That never stopped you before  from getting the titties out! Who are you trying to fool?   Affleck then goes on to discuss the  firmness  of her breasts. And for his finale, Affleck openly mocks people with cerebral palsy, suggesting they are  retards.

What is it that attracted both of these misogynist men who clearly use their positions to treat women like subjects? Is it Hillary s undying support for her husband Bill, who is also a serial sexual predator and accused rapist that attracted them to her?Misogynist pig Ben Affleck was so close to Hillary, that he actually was one of the people who was found to be emailing her on her secret private server.But of course, the mainstream media will never call out these Hollywood hypocrites who attempted to label President Trump a  misogynist  with absolutely no evidence.",left-news,"Oct 12, 2017",2774
" Patriot Can’t Wait To Go Fight Gubmint With Oregon Militia, Just Needs Welfare Check First","You know that feeling when you want to overthrow the oppressive federal government, but you can t afford it until that same oppressive federal government sends you your disability check? This right-wing patriot sure does!Among the thousands (upon thousands) of delusional anti-government comments the Bundy Ranch Facebook page has gotten in support of their violent takeover of a Oregon wildlife refuge to protest the punishment of convicted arsonists comes this gem from a bona fide right-wing nut job, who is chomping at the bit to grab his gun and join the cause   if only he could afford it.You read that right, Daniel Brewer here can t spend the $300 he estimates he ll need to get to Oregon because the government hasn t sent him his disability check yet. Instead, he sends his  prayers  to the Oregon militia and instructs them to go down shooting in a firefight with law enforcement.First identified by blogger Jim Wright of Stonekettle.com, the comment perfectly illustrates the absurd delusional fantasy the anti-government extremists manage to live in. It may be fun to pretend you and your warm gun can take on the big bad government, but you like the benefits that same government gives you   in this case, a literal check every month so you can get by.This isn t the first time we ve seen right-wingers confused about just what exactly it is they hate about the government. During the ugly healthcare debate, one of the most embarrassing rallying cries coming from those who opposed Obamacare was that the government should  keep its hands out of medicare.  Medicare, you may remember, is a government healthcare plan. President Obama himself mocked the sheer idiocy of these anti-government government users. He recounted a baffling letter he had received from one concerned woman   no doubt told by Fox News that the government would ruin her health insurance   who pleaded with him to not pass the ACA: I got a letter the other day from a woman. She said,  I don t want government-run health care. I don t want socialized medicine. And don t touch my Medicare.' Yikes.Our hapless anti-government militia sympathizer is, unsurprisingly, a conspiracy enthusiast as well. Scattered among pictures of his family, Brewer s Facebook page features dozens of right-wing memes and articles suggesting Muslims are imposing Sharia Law in America (they re not) and calls for Obama to resign (he isn t).The conclusion we can draw from this is clear: Many of the people who say they hate the government wouldn t know what to do without it. They don t want to pay taxes (who does?) and they don t like being told they can t do everything they want, but they sure do love the services  gubmint  gives them.Feature image via SBNation",News,"January 4, 2016",2733
 Here’s How The Trump Campaign Can Still Win And Why They Probably Won’t,"Dubbed the  missing white voters,  Nate Silver s FiveThirtyEight wrote an in depth analysis of what Donald Trump needs to do in order to win: Register between 5 to 47 million white voters starting now until election day.Here s a scary stat for Democrats: In 2012, President Obama won re-election by almost 5 million votes, but about 47 million eligible white voters without a college degree   including 24 million men   didn t bother to vote. In 2016, these nonvoters are part of the demographic that is most strongly in favor of Donald Trump.If Trump rouses even a fraction of these notoriously disaffected Americans   like this grease-smudged, 61-year-old first-time voter in western Pennsylvania   he could surge to victory. There s just one catch: If we re on the cusp of a blue-collar Great Awakening, it s not yet showing up in the registration data.In other words, Trump has all this support from this major demographic that could deliver him to a landslide victory   but they aren t registered. These  missing  white voters are literally the key to Donald Trump s success, and they hold the key to the swing state vote:If Trump were able to activate merely one of every eight of these  missing whites  to vote for him, he would wipe out Obama s 2012 margins in three states   Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania   and win both the Electoral College and the popular vote. If he were able to activate one of every five, he could add Virginia, Nevada, Iowa and New Hampshire.So, in order to merely  catch up  to President Obama, Trump needs to register at least 5 million more people. Considering registration among nonwhite voters (who overwhelmingly favor Hillary Clinton) is up in battleground states like Pennsylvania and North Carolina (compared to white registrants), and Clinton is gaining with white women, Trump has even more to go.If Trump hopes to overtake Obama s numbers in the crucial swing states, he better hurry up.The voting registration deadlines in Florida, Pennsylvania and Ohio are on October 11, less than two weeks away. In less than three weeks, Virginia and Nevada will reach their deadlines, October 18.Here are the dates of individual state deadlines.In other words, the Trump campaign has 18 days to register at least 5 million white voters in 5 swing states, which translates to 277,777 voters a day.Considering his horrendous excuse for a ground game, that won t be an easy feat.As of right now, Democrats have the upper hand in Pennsylvania and Virginia, where metropolitan, non-white registrants are trouncing rural whites.FiveThirtyEight finds that Trump s shoddy ground game, mixed with laziness enabled by the RNC, hurt his chances greatly:So what s going on? It could be that Trump is motivating slightly more new voters against him than for him. Or, perhaps more likely, it could be that white working class voters are out there to be activated, but Trump s campaign and the Republican National Committee have waited until too late to build the analytics and ground infrastructure necessary to identify and register them. That s where Clinton and the Democrats have excelled.So with less than three weeks to go until more than half the states end the registration process, the Trump campaign has already hit a wall (no pun intended). Democrats shouldn t get too excited. The chances that a massive voter turnout on election day could propel Trump to the presidency is a possibility. Democrats need to keep up their registration efforts, and launch a Get Out the Vote movement of equal or better proportions.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"September 30, 2016",3590
"BRITISH TV PERSONALITY: Don’t Blame Trump For Muslim Ban Comments , He Speaks For The Masses…Who Can Blame Americans For Not Wanting To End Up Like UK? [VIDEO]"," He [Obama] makes me want to wrap a suicide vest around my head and text BOOM to my brain On the Brit s desire to be politically correct about Muslims invasion of UK: You are too busy gazing at the fluff in your navel to see the gangrene in your foot Trump is terrifying. We have seen the future and it is bleak  said one reporter.In turn, thousands are busy clicking on a hideously impotent petition to  BAN TRUMP FROM GREAT BRITAIN .What exactly are they achieving? Having their say? Joining in the outrage bus?No doubt petition sites like change.org are on their web favourites, right up there with erectile dysfunction.co.uk. and single.com.They may as well calm down. We are not banning Donald from the UK.And even if Trump were elected President, he wouldn t be able to ban Muslims from his shores   even if he wanted to.Ask yourself: how could he possibly make it work?America struggles to control its southern border as it is. It is not going to be able to change the global passport system and get your religion stamped on your passport or your head to establish your faith.What s the Christianity test going to be? Snurfling a hot dog whilst singing  Give me joy in my heart, keep me praising ? After a Muslim couple gunned down 14 residents of San Bernardino, California, Americans looked for strong leadership. Just like after 9/11 when Bush made like a dog of war and took the fight to the terrorists.They didn t get from dreary Obama. He makes me want to wrap a suicide vest around my head and text BOOM to my brainDon't demonise Trump. He speaks for millions of Americans.And who can blame them for not wanting to end up like us?https://t.co/5SaKwd02Hu  Katie Hopkins (@KTHopkins) December 9, 2015It took the President a couple of days to even admit the attack was terror and when he did finally address a nervous nation on Sunday night his tone-deaf message was that Muslims were their  friends, neighbours and sports heroes. In contrast, Trump IS providing leadership. He knows some of his grand-standing is hot air. But he is articulating a sentiment held by millions and reinforcing himself as a protector of the American people.It s the reason Trump is the Republican front runner. He has spent just $330,000 on broadcasting to Jeb Bush s $42.5 million  which is indicative of how much America is enthralled by this new voice.I hear cries that he is a blithering idiot. I have often been called a deranged fool. But if this were true you could ignore me, ignore us, imaging the two of us shouting naked at the rain.It s because we articulate sentiments repressed by the politically correct consensus that we have a voice.Trump said:  We have places in London so radicalised that police are afraid for their lives. Within moments the Met Police, Prime Minister David Cameron, and the clownish Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, jumped to defend the reputation of the UK and distance themselves from this glaring truth.Yet, at the time of writing, no less than five bobbies on the beat have come forward to confirm that there ARE estates where they will only patrol out of uniform.There is fear among the police AND the public.I work with a team of cameramen in town who text their wives and partners on the hour to confirm they are safe.My family is not keen for me to be in the capital.Some friends will no longer come to London.How do you feel about the security of the city s shopping centres right now, after what happened in Paris?I watch the BBC news, our national broadcaster, ramming home messages of inclusiveness.Today they gave platform to a representative of the Muslim community telling Trump he is an Islamophobe and is not welcome here.But that s not my voice. That is not the voice of a nation. All Brits don t think that way.Being force-fed multi-culturalism brought us to this place. When the only permitted message is acceptance, any views to the contrary result in a label to shame you into silence.Racist! Islamophobe! Nazi!Don t just stick a label it. Be curious. Wonder, how has Trump come to articulate the views of a majority of Republicans across the States?Because I don t buy into the clear divide between extremist Muslims and peaceful ones. I don t see these as two separate entities. It is a sliding scale, a spectrum. From utterly peaceful, to ambivalence to sympathising, to extremist, to a man blowing up buses in Woburn Place.It is the same slippery slope which sees regular mosque attendees from Luton slip off to Syria to join ISIS. And suddenly a tight knit Muslim community knows nothing.Not the local imam, not local families, no one. No one denouncing terrorism. Just a wall of silence. In our country.Hate hidden behind walls we are told to accept and tolerate because we are multi-cultural. Repeat after me. Multi-cultural.History teaches us lessons were refuse to learn.The IRA would not have enjoyed decades of success without many among the Northern Irish Catholic population acting just the same way as the imams and family and friends of extremists in Luton today.We have gone too far and lost control of vast swathes of our country. In part we ARE a radicalised nation and it does nobody any favours to deny the obvious.Trump wants to call a temporary halt to Muslim immigration until America figures out what is going on.Adversaries may be quick to jump on Trump and make him the problem.But look around. You are too busy gazing at the fluff in your navel to see the gangrene in your foot.You lost sight of terrifying.It isn t a big, brash American untroubled by the need to be loved. It is the march of ISIS and the so-called Islamic State.You may want to distance yourself from Trump. You may want to carry on navel gazing.But for many Americans, Europe is rapidly becoming an example of everything they never want to be. Via: UK Daily Mail ",politics,"Dec 9, 2015",5809
 Richard Dreyfuss Just Showed ‘Little-Dick’ Donald Trump How To Win A Twitter Battle (TWEETS),"Richard Dreyfuss has provided us with some of the finest moments in movie and television history. His ability to run the table on acting to bring us everything from Mr. Holland to Dick Cheney to Bob s savior, Dr. Leo Marvin, has made him a Hollywood icon and fan favorite for more than four decades. In the age of social media, Dreyfuss is also proving himself to be an amply armed Twitter warrior, taking on the likes of none other than Donald J. Trump.Dreyfuss isn t so much upset about Trump s following of low-hanging fruit; they are as he puts it,  struggling.  The celebrities who have endorsed Trump? Dreyfuss views them in a different light altogether:The saddest people aren't Donald Trump's supporters. They're really struggling. It's Donald Trump's celebrity supporters who are whores.  Richard Dreyfuss (@RichardDreyfuss) May 30, 2016It s their souls they re whoring out for Trump, and it truly is sickening. To see people who would otherwise be considered intelligent and educated jumping on the Trump train to nowhere is infuriating not only to their fans with half a brain but to Dreyfuss as well. Luckily for Hollywood, people twisted enough to support the orange one aren t exactly A-listers, with Jon Voight being the closest thing to a decent actor in the bunch.After the shot at the Kirstie Alleys and Ted Nugents of the world, Dreyfuss moved on to Trump himself, taking a shot at his  off the cuff  style of speaking, which we like to call  racism :I get the thing about ""off the cuff speaking."" I get it! But when that speaking is dedicated to hurting latino americans, you're a racist.  Richard Dreyfuss (@RichardDreyfuss) May 30, 2016We don t need Richard Dreyfuss to tell us that Trump is a racist; it s as obvious as the comb-over. It s always nice, however, to see a public figure adored by so many dropping truth bombs on the Republicans  latest choice to destroy America. Dreyfuss wasn t quite finished yet, however, letting people know that his opinions aren t just speculative; he has actually had experience dealing with Trump in person:I met Donald Trump a few times but first was a party in Malbu where he got very upset that his date had the gault to speak with other guests  Richard Dreyfuss (@RichardDreyfuss) May 30, 2016And there s the Donald Trump we all know and despise. If you ve never experienced a man becoming so jealous that his date actually has a mind of her own that he loses his cool, you can t quite appreciate how it affects you. It s infuriating. Trump didn t just get a little upset, either. He was so butthurt that he acted like a  small-dicked prick,  forcing her to leave and causing those left behind to wonder if he would hurt her:He acted like a small dicked prick and pusher from the party and left of us wondering if we had made a mistake letter her go with him  Richard Dreyfuss (@RichardDreyfuss) May 30, 2016Autocorrect seems to have gotten the best of him there, but the implications are clear: Donald Trump is a deplorable human being whose own actions have caused people to fear for the safety of women he s dated. With that, Dreyfuss ended his anti-Trump Twitter barrage. Trump decided not to engage, as is usually the case when someone calls him out for his treatment of women.Game, set and match: Dreyfuss. And THAT is how to win a Twitter battle against Donald Trump. Embarrass him to the point that he stays out of it altogether.Featured image by John Sciulli/Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"May 31, 2016",3460

 New Carly Fiorina Website Gets Pushed Directly To Something She’s REALLY Gonna Hate,"As you probably know by now, Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz reached deep into his bag of desperation when he decided to prematurely name Carly Fiorina as his potential vice presidential running mate. Keep in mind, it is pretty much mathematically impossible for Cruz to get the nomination through elected delegates, so his only hope is in Donald Trump not getting to the much desired 1,237 delegates needed to secure the Republican nomination. Then, Cruz can go to the convention and try his best to figure out a way to get things to go in his favor. The thing is, Trump still has the popular vote by a large margin, so the will of the people is clearly not with Cruz.Anyway, back to Fiorina.As if Ted Cruz wasn t already horrible enough on his own, he decided to double-down on people not liking him by adding a woman who is against a woman s right to choose. Not only that, she lied about Planned Parenthood, was the CEO to a company that she promptly flushed down the toilet, including outsourcing jobs, and has absolutely no public policy experience whatsoever.Speaking of Planned Parenthood, some clever person just took the website  CarlyFiorinaForVicePresident.com  and pushed it to go directly to the Planned Parenthood Action Fund donation page.carlyfiorinaforvicepresident.comNot only quick thinking on the part of whoever put this together, but absolutely, breathtakingly brilliant.Just to remind you, Carly Fiorina loved to lie time after time about Planned Parenthood, and fed directly into the  baby body parts  myth that circulated unsubstantiated for several months.The fact that now her new mythical potential to be vice president now leads people directly to donating for Planned Parenthood isn t only amazing retribution, but pure magic.Well done, internet.

Robert Parry: US Intel Report on ‘Russian Hack’ Still Lacks Proof,"Consortium News Exclusive: Despite mainstream media acceptance, the U.S. intelligence community s assessment on alleged Russian  hacking  still lacks hard public evidence, a case of  trust-us  by politicized spy agencies, writes Robert Parry.By Robert ParryRepeating an accusation over and over again is not evidence that the accused is guilty, no matter how much  confidence  the accuser asserts about the conclusion. Nor is it evidence just to suggest that someone has a motive for doing something. Many conspiracy theories are built on the notion of  cui bono    who benefits   without following up the supposed motive with facts.But that is essentially what the U.S. intelligence community has done regarding the dangerous accusation that Russian President Vladimir Putin orchestrated a covert information campaign to influence the outcome of the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election in favor of Republican Donald Trump.Just a day after Director of National Intelligence James Clapper [image, left] vowed to go to the greatest possible lengths to supply the public with the evidence behind the accusations, his office released a 25-page report that contained no direct evidence that Russia delivered hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton s campaign chairman John Podesta to WikiLeaks.The DNI report amounted to a compendium of reasons to suspect that Russia was the source of the information   built largely on the argument that Russia had a motive for doing so because of its disdain for Democratic nominee Clinton and the potential for friendlier relations with Republican nominee Trump.But the case, as presented, is one-sided and lacks any actual proof. Further, the continued use of the word  assesses    as in the U.S. intelligence community  assesses  that Russia is guilty   suggests that the underlying classified information also may be less than conclusive because, in intelligence-world-speak,  assesses  often means  guesses. The DNI report admits as much, saying,  Judgments are not intended to imply that we have proof that shows something to be a fact. Assessments are based on collected information, which is often incomplete or fragmentary, as well as logic, argumentation, and precedents. But the report s assessment is more than just a reasonable judgment based on a body of incomplete information. It is tendentious in that it only lays out the case for believing in Russia s guilt, not reasons for doubting that guilt.A Risky BetFor instance, while it is true that many Russian officials, including President Putin, considered Clinton to be a threat to worsen the already frayed relationship between the two nuclear superpowers, the report ignores the downside for Russia trying to interfere with the U.S. election campaign and then failing to stop Clinton, which looked like the most likely outcome until Election Night.If Russia had accessed the DNC and Podesta emails and slipped them to WikiLeaks for publication, Putin would have to think that the National Security Agency, with its exceptional ability to track electronic communications around the world, might well have detected the maneuver and would have informed Clinton.So, on top of Clinton s well-known hawkishness, Putin would have risked handing the expected incoming president a personal reason to take revenge on him and his country. Historically, Russia has been very circumspect in such situations, usually holding its intelligence collections for internal purposes only, not sharing them with the public.While it is conceivable that Putin decided to take this extraordinary risk in this case   despite the widely held view that Clinton was a shoo-in to defeat Trump   an objective report would have examined this counter argument for him not doing so.But the DNI report was not driven by a desire to be evenhanded; it is, in effect, a prosecutor s brief, albeit one that lacks any real evidence that the accused is guilty. Further undercutting the credibility of the DNI report is that it includes a seven-page appendix, dating from 2012, that is an argumentative attack on RT, the Russian government-backed television network, which is accused of portraying  the US electoral process as undemocratic. The proof for that accusation includes RT s articles on  voting machine vulnerabilities  although virtually every major U.S. news organizations has run similar stories, including some during the last campaign on the feasibility of Russia hacking into the actual voting process, something that even U.S. intelligence says didn t happen.The reports adds that further undermining Americans  faith in the U.S. democratic process, RT broadcast, hosted and advertised third-party candidate debates.  Apparently, the DNI s point is that showing Americans that there are choices beyond the two big parties is somehow seditious. The RT hosts asserted that the US two-party system does not represent the views of at least one-third of the population and is a  sham,  the report said. Yet, polls have shown that large numbers of Americans would prefer more choices than the usual two candidates and, indeed, most Western democracies have multiple parties, So, the implicit RT criticism of the U.S. political process is certainly not out of the ordinary.The report also takes RT to task for covering the Occupy Wall Street movement and for reporting on the environmental dangers from  fracking,  topics cited as further proof that the Russian government was using RT to weaken U.S. public support for Washington s policies (although, again, these are topics of genuine public interest).Behind the CurtainThough it s impossible for an average U.S. citizen to know precisely what the U.S. intelligence community may have in its secret files, some former NSA officials who are familiar with the agency s eavesdropping capabilities say Washington s lack of certainty suggests that the NSA does not possess such evidence.Binney, in an article co-written with former CIA analyst Ray McGovern, said,  With respect to the alleged interference by Russia and WikiLeaks in the U.S. election, it is a major mystery why U.S. intelligence feels it must rely on  circumstantial evidence,  when it has NSA s vacuum cleaner sucking up hard evidence galore. What we know of NSA s capabilities shows that the email disclosures were from leaking, not hacking. For instance, that s the view of William Binney, who retired as NSA s technical director of world military and geopolitical analysis and who created many of the collection systems still used by NSA.There is also the fact that both WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and one of his associates, former British Ambassador Craig Murray, have denied that the purloined emails came from the Russian government. Going further, Murray has suggested that there were two separate sources, the DNC material coming from a disgruntled Democrat and the Podesta emails coming from possibly a U.S. intelligence source, since the Podesta Group represents Saudi Arabia and other foreign governments Continue this article at Consortium NewsREAD MORE  RUSSIAN HACK  NEWS AT: 21WIRE Russia Files",Middle-east,"January 8, 2017",7130

No. In people s conscious, the great divide in the American population is the first sure sign of a change to come.Ever since the unwelcome appearance of Donald Trump on the US governmental scene, the first president not to be placed into position by the deep state, the inquisition over what is going on has begun.Americans, more than ever are perplexed about their future. Their past is vague, and no matter how hard they peer into the rear view mirror   for those Americans, it doesn t make sense.9/11 doesn t make sense.The occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan doesn t make sense.The admittance to not finding any WMDs in Iraq and yet occupying it, doesn t make sense.To cause the deaths of 500, 000 children, and say it was worth the kill by the administrators   doesn t make sense.The cover-up for 9/11 doesn t make sense. To start a global war on terror and not explain how 9/11 occurred, or how a third building collapsed nine hours later, doesn t make sense.Obama s sudden appearance on the scene, doesn t make sense.The hundreds of books and articles that question the mechanism of the selection of Obama and never discussing them on the mainstream media, doesn t make sense.Obama placed in that position by the establishment, by the deep state, doesn t make sense.The blanked out middle-class of America, still pondering what happened, doesn t make sense.The fact that they lost their jobs beginning three decades ago, and having had to let go of their comfortable insured life working in an American factory, doesn t make sense.The abandoned factories and grand industries that once made America great, lying obsolete and deserted, doesn t make sense.Half of Detroit abandoned and deserted, doesn t make sense.The media cheering on its hallucinatory concussions all throughout these disasters, doesn t make sense.The PTSD ed war veterans and the official suicide rates of US soldiers on and off duty, go undetected and barely seen in the rear view mirror of the media, never make sense.All the common man sees today is one man attacked by the same mass  media that pushed them into the illegal wars and illegitimate debts from zero to $20 trillion, between 1979-2017, by some estimates.But the  buck stops here  as President Eisenhower once famously said. The heavy train loaded with old rusted debris is coming to a screeching halt. Meanwhile the curious are looking wide-eyed. NATO doesn t know where it really stands.  The think tanks of Washington   the hub of all mesmerizing strategies   are vacant, or their curtains half drawn. The Neocons are contemplating plan B. The  Israeli firsters  are caught off guard. They are planning ahead of time desperately. But whose ears do they have this time?! A man who calls the weapons of the think tanks, the mainstream media,  liars  ,  fake news !?Once the invisible sword, the likes of New York Times and CNN are today exposed and blunted. Who dared call CNN  liars ?! CNN engaged America meticulously into two  fake  wars which indebted the United States, and still avoided any blame. It was almost scripted and storyboarded like a Hollywood movie. Now, it is still loose, with acrobatic skills evading all detection like a skilled serial killer breathing in our civilized world.Now the eye-opening process has begun. Watch out for the six-packers and their evaporated illusions! You have finally awaken the slumbering slave of America, and awakened they are Alas! All empires go through these stages.  The awkward moments must be tolerated i.e. the president without a cabinet, the supporters with semi-automatic weapons guarding his speeches in Georgia and Florida. The anti-Semitic accusations that are being discussed in the morning regular sessions on CNN. The angry obliterated Alan Dershowitz who is nervously accusing CNN s moderator Don Lemon, of giving the anti-Semites their fifteen minutes of fame. They fear that it will catch fire on the colleges and universities.The masquerade however is over. The Paul Wolfowitzs, the Richard Perles, the Daniel Pipes have to face the masses. The not-so-innocent masses that succumbed to the beast s demands also wait. The confrontation lingers silently.  No one even knows these people  as Thomas Friedman of the New York Times once famously said in his interviews with the Haaretz. Twenty Five Neocons have planned and executed what has happened in the past two and a half decades.The wakeup call has rung, the moment of illusion has disappeared. The apparent, sudden sun is beginning to shine gloriously, one ray at a time. Wash your face and watch the unfolding.21WIRE contributor Nader Talebzadeh is an Iranian filmmaker, producer, writer, cultural and historical commentator and New Horizon Conference Chair, Channel One TV program host  A sr  (The Time ).

ABC News Suspend Anchor Brian Ross Over Fake News Report on Trump-Flynn ‘Russian Collusion’,"After 18 months of rampant speculation over Trump and  Russian collusion  and alleged  Russian hacking  in the 2016 election, in a cloud of non-stop, 24/7 fake news being generated by CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS, Washington Post, New York Times, LA Times, as well as notorious MSM fake news outsourcing agencies like The Daily Beast   the Never Trump Resistance has yet to present a single item of evidence to justify their year and a half-long political witch hunt.In this sea of delusion, there are still a number of desperate media persons who are willing to punt on a contrived plot or narrative   hoping that theirs will be  the one  to finally nail the embattled President on grounds for impeachment beyond a reasonable doubt. Already a number of mainstream journalists, including three reporters from CNN, have been fired or let go as networks are now fear legal repercussions from their new normalized practice of lying and inventing plots about the White House and  Russian meddling. This week saw another high-profile casualty, ABC s Chief Investigative Correspondent Brian Ross, as the  resistance  continues to launch blind media attacks on the President.On Saturday, ABC News executives announced that star anchor Ross would be suspended for one month without pay over an alleged  botched   exclusive  implicating former national security adviser Michael Flynn.Clueless: ABC s Chief Investigative Correspondent Brian Ross.During Ross s live  special report , an invented story-line was fed to a clueless Ross which claimed that Flynn would testify that Donald Trump had  ordered him  to make contact with Russians about foreign policy   while Trump was still a candidate in the general election.According to FOX News, the fake news report  raised the specter of Trump s impeachment and sent the stock market plummeting. Later in the day, ABC issued a  clarification  to Ross s report, saying that Trump s alleged directive came after he d been elected president. Ross himself appeared on  World News Tonight,  several hours after the initial report, to clarify his error.Afterwards, ABC News tried to justify the fake news release, claiming that Ross  report  had not been fully vetted through our editorial standards process. Clearly, Ross took one for the team (The Resistance) here, as anyone who works in media will know. He would have been fed the bogus report by news producers, before doing what mainstream media news anchors do everyday of their careers   unwittingly reading whatever words are scrolling down his teleprompter.ABC News statement went on to try and gloss over their fake news report saying,  It is vital we get the story right and retain the trust we have built with our audience. News officials then sounded even more ridiculous as they scrambled to pave-over their propaganda practices claiming that,  These are our core principles. We fell far short of that yesterday. What s clear from this story is that when it comes to all things Trump and Russia, the US mainstream media feel they are within their right to dispense with all normal journalistic standards so long as the story falls in line with a specific political agenda.Unfortunately, this is just one more reason to always be cautious when trusting watching mainstream media reporting of any any major news event.READ MORE ABOUT MAINSTREAM FAKE NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Fake News FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE   SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV ",US_News,"December 5, 2017",3433
OBAMA’S FORMER “Press Liar” Warns Trump Not To Cross The Community Organizer’s “Red Line”…LOL! [VIDEO],"Former White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Monday that there were some  clear red lines  that would cause former President Obama to speak out publicly against federal action.In an interview, MSNBC s Chris Jansing asked Earnest about the former president s promise to weigh in publicly if he senses a threat to America s  core values.  Obama spoke out in support of protests of President Trump s controversial temporary immigration ban proposal at the end of January. What do you think,  Jansing asked Earnest,  would motivate him to get back involved in the public debate in a way that he s not willing to do right now? Earnest made clear that Obama would not be interested in responding to every little thing. After the last eight years, the president doesn t relish the prospect of getting back into the day-to-day fights that characterize governing the United States of America in the 21st century,  Earnest said.  He spent the last eight years doing it, it s somebody else s turn to do that now. What would motivate President Obama to reengage in the political debate,  Earnest continued,  is if we saw the federal government start to cross some clear red lines in terms of long-observed norms and values that frankly I think that we started to take for granted.   For entire story: WFBWatch:Earnest s use of the term  red lines  was noteworthy given Obama s infamous history with the phrase. Obama pledged in 2012 that Syria using chemical weapons would cross a  red line  with him, but he backed off taking unilateral military action when the Assad regime did so in 2013.

 Desperate Lindsey Graham Calls Clinton Foundation Controversy A “Gift From The Political Gods” (VIDEO),"Senator Lindsey Graham has had an on-again, off-again relationship with Donald Trump, having first condemned and opposed the Republican nominee, then endorsed, un-endorsed, tried to get his other GOP buddies to also stop supporting him, and now he seems to be back on the Trump bandwagon in hopes that by getting The Donald elected, Republicans can keep the Senate.That s why Graham is particularly thrilled about a recent report on the Clinton Foundation that outlines that  more than half of the private individuals who met with Hillary Clinton during her tenure as Secretary of State were also donors to the Clinton Foundation in some capacity  and that Clinton had given those donors favorable treatment.In an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, Graham celebrated this  gift from the political gods , claiming that this might actually help Trump  close the gap  with the Democratic nominee   but only if Trump plays his cards right (and we all know what the slim chances of that happening are). Graham said: If Mr. Trump can up his game   and he is, he s doing much better. If he can control   if he can close the gap I think the chance of keeping the Senate goes up. Graham also criticized the Clinton report, saying that it reeks of wrong, it reeks of insider benefits, the inside versus the outside, and Trump represents the outside and he s in a pretty good spot.  Obviously, Graham isn t considering that Trump s own business and charity record is filled with unethical, fraudulent activity.This interview gets somewhat comical when Graham said, with a straight face, that if only Trump could harness his  temperament , demonstrate  judgment  and show that he was  qualified  to be the next President of the United States, he might be able to make the Republican Party proud. Unfortunately, we all know that Trump is just going to disappoint Graham and break his heart   again.You can watch the interview below:Featured image via Darren McCollester / Getty Images",News,"August 24, 2016",1974
 BREAKING: This New Analysis BAD News For Obamacare Haters (DETAILS),"Paul Ryan is all over Twitter chanting  repeal and replace,  and proclaiming the ACA a disaster. Trump has said repeatedly that it s going to explode (and it ll be on the Democrats  heads when it does). They re all spewing dire warnings about insurers leaving the marketplace in 2018, and yet, they still don t have a plan, which is a worse failure than anything since they had seven years to do it. And unfortunately for them, there s a new analysis out that points to something besides their dire predictions.Standard & Poor s took a look at the performance of many Blue Cross Blue Shield plans across nearly 36 states, and found that the insurers under Blue Cross Blue Shield actually reduced their losses in 2016, will probably break even this year, and will start seeing a profit from the marketplace in 2018.S&P bluntly gives the lie to the GOP s cries of  death spirals  with this:After years in which many insurers lost money, then lost even more in 2015,  we are seeing the first signs in 2016 that this market could be manageable for most health insurers,  the Standard & Poor s analysts said. The  market is not in a  death spiral. A majority of Americans want Congress to fix the ACA, not  repeal and replace  it anymore. Their sorry attempt at passing a healthcare bill last month further damaged their already-destroyed credibility on the issue, and nearly 70 percent of Americans want to keep the parts of the ACA that are working, and fix the parts that aren t working so well.Also, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation report, 33 percent of Americans say that Republicans are responsible for the failure of their farce of a healthcare plan, and another 28 percent say Trump is responsible. Only 25 percent of those surveyed blame Democrats for the bill s failure.It s true that insurers are threatening to pull out of the ACA s marketplace, which will leave some places with only one carrier or without any at all in the marketplace. That s something that could have been changed or prevented if the GOP had actually managed to get something together over the last seven years.Depending on what happens this year, though, that could change. If it does, then Republicans will be out of excuses.Featured image by Win McNamee via Getty Images",News,"April 9, 2017",2259
WHY DID THE UN HAVE A PRO-GUN CONTROL MEETING AT SPA IN MEXICO And Why Weren’t Dissenters Allowed?,"Government officials using other people s money to enjoy a swanky seaside vacation in Mexico while discussing how to take away our right to bear arms Sounds about right The first annual meeting of the nations that have ratified the 2014 Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) opened on Monday, August 24 at a spa in Canc n, Mexico. The treaty s been controversial in the U.S. from the moment negotiations on it began, and this meeting will surely stoke the suspicions of those who think the treaty s real aim is to crimp America s sovereignty and constitutional liberties.The meeting was originally supposed to be in Mexico City, but wouldn t you rather spend your off-hours by the pool?Of course, you may think it s weird, or sick, that all these nations pretend to believe that the best place to discuss the arms trade is at a seaside resort. After all, many of them spend all their time pleading poverty and demanding aid from the U.S. to implement the treaty.But frankly, they don t care how bad it looks. They ve got a great boondoggle going, and no one s going to spoil it for them.But everyone s going to Mexico not just because it s got great beaches. Mexico has been one of the leading campaigners for the ATT. It wants to use the treaty to promote gun control in the U.S.Mexico s theory is that, since any gun in the U.S. might at some point conceivably cross the U.S. border, all U.S. guns have to be controlled in the name of controlling the international arms trade. That s not going to happen at this meeting (or ever, if the U.S. retains its sanity).But Mexico, the other nations that agree with it, and  progressive  groups that campaigned for the treaty the blame-America-first activists, in other words are in this game for the long haul. So it s not a good sign that Mexico s been given the job of hosting the first treaty meeting.It s even less good that Mexico s spent much of the past year colluding with the activists to keep skeptics (like myself) out of the room. Their view was that only true believers who campaigned for the treaty should be allowed to see what s going on.You might wonder what they re afraid of. We skeptics make no secret of our views, but we re a well-mannered bunch: no spitballs. However, if we were always in the room, we d report on exactly how closely the activists are working with Mexico and other likeminded nations.The activists led by the global Control Arms Coalition, which has a massive presence at Canc n are the only insiders in the treaty process, and they want to keep it that way.The ATT was adopted through the U.N., which means it was drafted by the world s nations. That s bad, because there are lots of incapable and evil governments in the world. But it s better than the alternative, which was for the ATT to have been drafted solely by the activists.Now that the treaty exists, however, the activists want to take it over and direct it for their own purposes. What they want is to turn the ATT into an arms control and disarmament treaty.Keeping skeptics away is part of that campaign.So far, they ve not succeeded in keeping us out, or in taking over the treaty. But the ATT isn t simply a treaty that s over and done with. Like many treaties, it s a process that will go on and on, in meeting after meeting, year after year. And the activists have lots of people, lots of money, and lots of time.The U.S. s goal in Canc n should be to do whatever it can to prevent the activists from getting any footholds. That means ensuring a treaty secretariat that s strictly limited in its purposes, conference rules that don t privilege the activists, and reporting requirements that don t go beyond current U.S. practice or identify individual U.S. firearms owners.Via: Daily Signal",Government News,"Sep 5, 2015",3732
Five Things To Look Out For With Trump’s Pentagon,"21st Century Wire says Although he had some great ideas on the campaign trail, still expect the war hawks and Israeli Lobby instruments like John Bolton, Tom Cotton, and Rudy Giuliani to gradually nudge the new President and his administration, in a concerted attempt to try and reshape Trump s relatively common sense campaign foreign policy directives  Kristina Wong and Rebecca Kheel The HillDonald Trump s election was as much a surprise to the defense world as it was to much of the nation. Here are five key things the Pentagon can expect from Trump. 1. Rising spendingTrump has called for a much bigger military and some experts think he could increase defense spending by 20 percent, from $583 billion in 2017 to nearly $700 billion.While that may sound like a lot, it is in line with what the Obama administration projected for 2012 before the Pentagon was hit with sequestration   mandatory budget caps imposed by the 2011 Budget Control Act.Trump has called for increasing the size of the active duty Army from 475,000 to 540,000 troops, and the Marine Corps from 24 to 36 battalions. He wants to build a 350-ship Navy, have 1,200 fighter aircraft in the Air Force and increase missile defense.Trump has pledged to lift limits on spending from the 2011 budget bill, something that would require action by Congress and could be difficult. The limits are in place until 2021.The Congress is controlled by the GOP, but not all Republicans are in favor of more military spending.Increasing defense spending could also increase the deficit, something Trump and the GOP are loathe to do. He separately wants to cut taxes, including for the wealthy, would could add to deficit concerns.2. Targeting ISISTrump has said he would  aggressively pursue  military operations to  crush and destroy  the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, but what that would entail is far from clear.By the time Trump takes office on Jan. 20, offensives to retake ISIS s strongholds in both countries will be underway, but the terrorist group is expected to continue waging an insurgency in both places even if they fall.Trump would likely seek cooperation with Russia in Syria to defeat ISIS, but it s not clear what that would mean. Russia began an air campaign there in September 2015, but has been hitting anti-regime rebels supported by the U.S., as well as civilians.Trump has also called for international cooperation to cut off ISIS s funding, expanding intelligence sharing, and cyberwarfare to disrupt its propaganda and recruiting. Trump has said he would also  decimate  Al Qaeda.3. Syria and AfghanistanNearly 500,000 people have been killed and 11 million displaced by the Syrian war, an intractable problem for President Obama.Trump has suggested that Syria President Bashar al-Assad is better than the  alternative,  which would be the coalition of anti-regime rebels that include U.S.-backed moderates as well as extremists. At the same time, Trump has said he would build safe zones in Syria, in order to stop the flow of refugees into Europe.Those two goals are somewhat contradictory, as Syria and Russia have a broad definition of  terrorists  and have been hitting those civilians the safe zones would protect. U.S. defense officials and experts say implementing safe zones would mean war with Syria, and possibly Russia.Trump s future policy in Afghanistan, where the U.S. has 9,800 troops, is also unclear.Before his bid for presidency, he had called for withdrawing troops, and criticized efforts to nation-build in the country. He reiterated that sentiment earlier this year, saying at a rally in August that he would end  the era of nation building. However, with the Taliban making a comeback, and al Qaeda and ISIS militants also trying to build safe havens, there will be pressure for Trump to maintain U.S. troops in Afghanistan.4. Closer ties with Russia?U.S. relations with Russia could improve under Trump.Trump has said he could meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin before he takes office in January, and repeatedly complimented him during the campaign.His statements on Russia s invasion of the Ukraine territory in Crimea and his refusal to blame Russia for cyber hacks against U.S. political institutions has unnerved people in both parties.It s possible Trump won t change policy toward Russia.Vice President-elect Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (R) took a much harder line against Russia during the campaign, suggesting during the vice presidential debate that the U.S. Could take military action against Russia in Syria.Trump will likely face staunch opposition to cozier relations from Congress from key Republicans such as Sen. John McCain (Ariz.).Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), whose name has been floated for secretary of State under Trump, has been highly critical of Russia s role in Syria.Some experts say although Trump may seek to actively engage Russia, cooperation would likely be based on what s mutually beneficial. He is a deal maker so he s going to want things in return for giving Russia what it is seeking,  said Paul Schwartz, defense analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.Trump s win also puts the future of the 67-year-old NATO alliance in question at a time when lawmakers are working on bulking up the eastern flank to deter an increasingly aggressive Russia and finding ways to combat hybrid warfare, cyber attacks and terrorism.Trump called NATO obsolete multiple times over the course of the campaign, saying it should do more to fight terrorism. Trump also said he would look at whether NATO allies have  fulfilled their obligations to us  before deciding whether to defend them if they are attacked.Just five of 28 members meet the goal of spending 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense: the United States, the United Kingdom, Greece, Estonia and Poland.Michael O Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said there are a few paths Trump could take to fulfill his campaign promise.In one scenario, Trump could immediately pull out of commitments to defend countries that aren t meeting their 2 percent obligations.Trump could also make deals with such countries that give them a few years to meet the goal.5. Guantanamo staysWith President Obama unlikely to fulfill his pledge to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility by Jan. 20, Trump will inherit the facility and almost certainly keep it open Continue this story at The HillREAD MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files",Middle-east,"November 16, 2016",6522
FAKE NEWS WEEK: Electronic Voting – The Big Lie That Just Won’t Die,"  In response to the establishment media s contrived  fake news  crisis designed to marginalise independent and alternative media sources of news and analysis, 21WIRE is running its own #FakeNewsWeek awareness campaign, where each day our editorial team at 21st Century Wire will feature media critiques and analysis of mainstream corporate media coverage of current events   exposing the government and the mainstream media as the real purveyors of  fake news  throughout modern history . Mark Anderson 21st Century WireThe U.S. government, the  intelligence  community and their malicious mainstream-media partners in deception just won t let it go.The underhanded U.S. unitary state, which seeks a unipolar world with the U.S. in charge, still says in its  never ending story  that omniscient, omnipresent Russian leader Vladimir Putin masterminded hacking the computerized systems of U.S. elections as well as Democratic National Committee computers.Then, as the stale tale goes, Russia handed all the resulting electronic juicy tidbits over to Wikileaks, which turned around and dropped a veritable information bomb on America s delicate democracy.But while that  bomb  allegedly influenced enough people to vote for the winner Donald Trump and not for loser Hillary Clinton, to this day, according to big media, we re supposed to forget all about the creepy, damning, criminally inclined things contained in the Podesta-Clinton emails themselves.So, let s try and grasp this media-massaged, intel-infused message: Even though the emails apparently had enough sizzle and scandal to boost one presidential candidate over another, we re still prodded to think that the information in the emails somehow isn t the issue even though the content of the emails will always be what matters the most.Also notice what no one, and certainly no media outlet, dares to mention regarding the other half of this issue: If Putin also was crafty enough to hack into the actual state-level U.S. election systems, then this implies that U.S. elections systems can be hacked in the first place.This is huge. Think about it the next time you use an electronic  ES&S Ivotronic touchscreen voting machine or Hart InterCivic s model at the polls.All along, we ve been reassured that the electronic voting systems used in about 95% of American voting precincts are The Greatest Thing Ever Invented and Monumentally Secure Are they really? THE ELECTORAL INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX: Securing America s automated voting systems has become a complicated affair. And, all along, writers like Yours Truly, highly credible Texas vote-reform activists like Laura Pressley, Vickie Karp, Bev Harris and others have uncovered tons of evidence that electronic elections are an immensely deceptive and vulnerable apparatus   vulnerable to external hacking and also to being  fixed  from the inside without any need for outside hacking, through the proprietary software inside the these voting contraptions that can be pre-set to steal elections if the need arises.You re going to want to see my interview with Laura Pressley, on behalf of American Free Press, through this link right here.THE RUSSIAN DISTRACTION As Pressley shows in detail, the integrity and lawfulness of Texas elections are in serious peril   not because of any outside  autocrats  like Putin and his supposed cyberspace minions, but because of state and local election officials, right here in the U.S., who absolutely will not follow state election law. And the average TV or newspaper reporter is utterly tone-deaf to these problems, which keeps the people in perpetual fog, unaware that U.S. elections have been effectively privatized by those who make the machines that count the votes.To hear more about this  Putin the Hacker  debacle, please listen to my Dec. 29, 2016 interview with UK-based radio host Andrew Carrington Hitchcock on his regularly scheduled American Free Press (AFP) show.Furthermore, check out this Election Night Gatekeepers overview on my blog by election-theft expert Jim Condit Jr., who worked with the late Collier brothers in their game-changing book,  Votescam.  The media is part of a secretive consortium that counts the vote in secret, meaning the mainstream press  fake news carries with it evidence of criminal collusion.The unavoidable conclusion is that the powers-that-be   in going after Putin and calling him The Supreme Hacker of the Known Universe  have shot themselves in the foot because they re clearly and finally admitting in the process that U.S. voting systems CAN be hacked, after more than a decade of denial.This means that all their denials about electronic election fraud are invalidated.  The critics of electronic election systems are right. The establishment is wrong. End of discussion.Meanwhile, recalling some recent history, Wayne Madsen Reports provided some important perspective: Although the Central Intelligence Agency has had a long history of undermining presidents-elect and prime ministers-elect in other countries, the United States has never witnessed the intelligence agency so blatantly attempting to politically weaken a U.S. president-elect [Trump] just a few weeks prior to the inauguration. What the CIA is doing in forcing Donald Trump into shifting from his campaign promise of restoring good relations with Russia to one of outright hostility to Moscow   favored by the CIA, Director of National Intelligence (DNI), and the neo-conservatives within the Republican and Democratic Party establishments  is nothing less than an overt threat to American democracy. WHERE ARE THE CYBER-COPS?And, as American Free Press reported in its first 2017 edition, the young owner of a Russian-based web-server company may have a handle on who stole sensitive electronic communications between Hillary Clinton and some of her advisors.But 26-year-old Vladimir Fomenko knows one thing for sure: U.S. intelligence, which professes to be hot on the trail of exposing Russian hacking, doesn t seem to care about his story.This means that our leaders in Washington have long ignored a solid lead that could prove once and for all whether or not the Russian government hacked the computers systems of top Democrats and U.S. elections systems.Fomenko recently spoke to AFP to try and demystify the controversy surrounding his King Servers company and the cyberattacks purportedly carried out at the behest of Russia.AFP writer John Friend, quoting Fomenko, noted that even though his servers were exploited in this cyber-crime:  No U.S. law enforcement or intelligence agency is interested in speaking with him to gather real evidence on the perpetrators. The U.S. was not the only country hit by computer hackers. Hackers evidently targeted Germany, Turkey, and Ukraine, apparently attempting to upset democratic processes.It was when WikiLeaks began releasing hacked data from the DNC late this past summer that media reports and the Clinton campaign began blaming Russia with no solid evidence to support that assertion.After learning about this shadowy criminal activity, Fomenko immediately shut down the servers and looked into the situation. He says he s willing to cooperate with law enforcement. We pursued an investigation without delay and found some tracks leading to Europe,  Fomenko told AFP. Web hosting is a legal enterprise  . . . regulated by law,  Fomenko added.  King Servers works in Russia, the U.S., and the Netherlands and complies with the laws of these countries. Fomenko stressed:  No U.S. law enforcement agency has contacted us at this time. Neither the FBI nor any other U.S., Russian, or Dutch intelligence agency has contacted us. The plot thickens WSB-TV Channel 2 reporters in Atlanta, Georgia actually did their job and noted:  The Georgia Secretary of State s office now confirms 10 different cyberattacks on its network all trace back to U.S. Department of Homeland Security IP addresses. Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, dissatisfied with the federal government s dodgy explanation about these DHS cyberattacks, fired off a letter to then-President-elect Donald Trump to put him in the loop.So, it ll be interesting to see if Trump ever helps Georgia, and other states whose election systems were supposedly hacked, figure out what happened and who s really responsible.After all this time, the accusation that Russia  did it  still looks less and less credible, as this additional AFP piece outlines, yet the American establishment, thinking it could blame Russia to explain Hillary s loss and come to grips with Trump s win, just won t drop the blame-Putin narrative.We can only hope that Trump s claim that he ll start putting some limits on our out-of-control spy agencies will come true. If ever there was a good reason to pursue those limits, this high-level U.S. intelligence gambit to blame Putin, no matter what, is it. The orthodox press has been a solid ally all along of these intel-intrigues.And this gives Trump a chance to prove he s the real deal, and not another asset of the establishment, despite his seemingly honest intentions to name names and seek real solutions to the real problems that are troubling Americans and citizens across the world.For, if elections are not really a means to find and assign better leaders who will use their victory as a mandate to do the right thing for the voters, then what s the point of having elections at all, hacked or not hacked, honest or not?Author Mark Anderson is an investigative journalist and features writer for American Free Press, and is editor of The Truth Hound.

"HIV POSITIVE, CRACK SMOKING, Liberal Actor Charlie Sheen Wishes Death On Donald Trump…Gets DESTROYED On Twitter","Less than one year ago, Charlie Sheen s ex-wife Denise Richards told reporters that their twin daughters are allegedly scared of him. Sisters Sam, 11, and Lola, 10, are reportedly scared to be alone with their father after an alleged string of abusive texts and threatening outbursts.Richards is suing Sheen for $1.2 million after he allegedly evicted her from the home Sheen left to their daughters, Sam, 11, and Lola, 10, in a trust.The suit filed last week alleges that Sheen once texted to Lola:  Your dad is a rock star genius . . . Your mom is a p s wart,  and that he called the girl a  [bleeping] pig whore  while yelling,  I m going to kill you and I m going to kill your mom. In November 2015, Sheen announced he was infected with HIV and had paid upwards of $10 million to keep it a secret.It s not that being infected with HIV is in and of itself a crime, but most people who would hide it while continuing to have sex would be in jail. But then again, Hollywood moonbats are not  most people  and like Hillary and other leftist politicians, they have special rules.In November 2015, The Daily Mail published a story about Sheen with this headline:You are a crack smoking, hooker buying, mentally enslaved moron with HIV.

 This North Carolina High School Just Made It So Trans Students Can Be Pepper Sprayed For Peeing,"It s hard to believe that so many people are so remarkably stupid and bigoted in North Carolina, but alas, they really seem to be. Of course, not the entire state, but there does seem to be a rather large group of the population that believes transgender individuals are out to cause harm. When in reality, those who are transgender are actually just living their truth and should be treated with dignity and respect for doing so.With the passage and signing of HB2, better known as the now infamous  bathroom bill,  it s basically given citizens of the state permission to be the bathroom police. To be clear, HB2 has nothing to do with bathroom safety, and everything to do with being discriminatory bigots to the transgender community.Now, because of this legislated discrimination, the Rowan-Salisbury Board of Education is now allowing students to bring pepper spray into school bathrooms. You know, to  protect themselves,  which in all honesty just gave permission to every bigoted child in that state to use this allowance as a  get out of jail free card  to those they want to physically abuse by means of pepper spray. Think about it, you can already hear the  I thought they were going to attack me  excuses piling up, and administrators being like,  well, in that case Board member Chuck Hughes, who is in favor of the pepper spray and referenced HB2 in his argument, said: Depending on how the courts rule on the bathroom issues, it may be a pretty valuable tool to have on the female students if they go to the bathroom, not knowing who may come in. Keep in mind, this also means that students will seemingly be able to have pepper spray on their person at all times while in school. Surely there will be no complications with such a thing (sarcasm).This school board just made it perfectly fine for students to openly harm transgender individuals. Individuals who just need to use the restroom like everybody else. It s outrageous and should be illegal, but instead, it s openly condoned by even the highest office in the state. Chances are, North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory would approve. Disgusting.Featured image via THV11",News,"May 11, 2016",2143
 Watch Pres Jimmy Carter Go Beast Mode On Republican Candidates (VIDEO),"Former president Jimmy Carter denounced what he called the  legal bribery afflicting our political system, turning the presidential race into one that is influenced by a few billionaires, lobby groups, and corporate oligarchs who sponsor candidates by giving billions in exchange for influencing the candidates  policy platform. In an interview with the BBC, Carter said: The erroneous ruling of the Supreme Court, where millionaires and billionaires can put in unlimited amounts of money in to the campaign, it gives legal bribery a chance to prevail, because almost all the candidates, whether they are honest or not, Democrat or Republican, rely on these massive amounts of money in order to campaign. [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZFc1QqRbbQ] President Carter has a very important point and one that should be taken into account: The democracy of the country is threatened and eroded when an elected official, especially a president, owes a handful of individuals who finance his/her presidential campaign favors.Take for example, the NRA. The NRA is a very well funded and organized lobby group that lobbies Washington officials in favor of lax guns laws. That, in turn, means easier access to guns, which translates into sales. Some people get rich as a result of gun sales, but the country collectively suffers, as has been documented, with record numbers of shootings around the country.Another example is individual donations. Republican candidate Marco Rubio s sponsor, the billionaire Norman Braman, has donated $15-25 million to Rubio s campaign. Braman is staunchly pro-Israel and has financed the building of settlements in the Palestinian West Bank. Israeli settlements are illegal under international law, and US policy condemns settlement building in the West Bank. Yet, you can bet that if Rubio should become president, Braman will cash in his chips by ensuring that Rubio goes along with Israel s illegal activities. In the end, we will continue to have a mess in the Middle Eat, which hurts the region and the United States.The bottom line is that billions of dollars are being spent by candidates to win the presidency and much of that money comes from a few individuals. The only way to change that is to create a constitutional amendment that overturns the Citizens United Supreme Court ruling that allows individuals and corporations to contribute unlimited sums to political races. Until we do this, a small number of individuals and corporations will continue to exert undemocratic influence over our country.

 Fox News Host BEGS Republicans: Leave Trump ALOOOONE (VIDEO),"Fox News host Eric Bolling wants mean Republicans to just leave his favorite candidate, Donald Trump, alone. Bolling, the host of the Fox weekend business news show Cashin  In, released a special message on the Saturday edition of the program timed to coincide with the upcoming South Carolina primary.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f8QbU8YMdMBolling, who also co-hosts The Five during the week, noted that the  Our Principles  Republican super PAC headed by former Romney aide Katie Packer is targeting Trump. The ads show that on a number of issues, Trump has flip-flopped from a moderate/liberal position to positions designed to pander to conservative Republican voters. Abortion, health care, and taxes are among Trump s flip-flops.While you would think Bolling, a conservative, would be happy to see an expose of Trump s fakery, his problem is actually with the ad itself.In his rant, Bolling complains about establishment Republicans consistently tearing down conservatives, as he sees it, and points out that he believes the PAC ad is a part of this sustained campaign.He calls on the ad makers to stop going after the reality star turned Republican presidential front-runner and racial demagogue. Bolling, speaking to the camera, told the PAC that  Trump s not your problem. Liberals and socialists are.  He suggests that instead  Why not use that Super PAC money to expose the dark underbelly of liberal politics? Bolling s suggestion is humorous because he effectively works for the biggest anti-liberal Super PAC around, Fox News. His network is a steady stream of lies, half-truths, and propaganda designed to attack the Democratic Party and the left. At the same time, actual super PACs on the right and other dark money groups designed to shield their donors are consistently the source of propaganda campaigns against the left. The Koch Brothers preside over a network that some believe could spend $1 billion in 2016 in order to elect a Republican president and congress.Fox has been the premiere media vehicle for Trump. He has received more airtime on the network than any other candidate, and even when feuding with Fox host Megyn Kelly, he still got coverage on their prime time programming. Of those at Fox, Bolling has been one of the staunchest supporters and defenders of Trump s campaign for months now, and according to a report he was directly ordered to back Trump by Fox News boss Roger Ailes.Featured image via YouTube",News,"February 13, 2016",2451
 Trump Loves To Say The New York Times Is ‘Failing’ – So They Just Effortlessly Embarrassed Him With Simple Numbers,"Print journalism and longstanding papers have been struggling since the advent of the internet and increased competition faced by blogs and op-ed sites. That, combined with poor understanding of marketing on new platforms, has combined to really cause a struggle in the journalism industry.So, on a certain level, journalists can thank Trump. Despite unleashing a war on freedom of the press never before seen in our nation s history, he s been a boon to business, with massive public backlash against Trump and his fake news army resulting in a thirst for facts and information.Take the New York Times, for example. In the first quarter of 2017, the NYT signed on more new subscribers than any other period in history. Stock is up 50 percent. Digital advertising revenue went up nearly 20 percent. So when Donald Trump says  when is the failing NYT going to go out of business,  as he did today, the answer is  not soon.  They ve been around for 160 years and don t look to be going anyplace anytime soon.Here s the specific tweet in question:How much longer will the failing nytimes, with its big losses and massive unfunded liability (and non-existent sources), remain in business?  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 7, 2017And here s the reply by the New York Times, completely demolishing whatever little remnants of dignity Trump has left at this point:That is incorrect. NYT s business is thriving. Most ever paid subs: 3.3 million; and growing profit, income and revenues.

BREAKING: WHY IS OBAMA Sending Huge Number Of Troops To Germany? [VIDEO],"The largest armed U.S. military brigade to be deployed to Europe since the end of the Cold War arrived Saturday at a port in northern Germany, military officials said.The U.S. Army s 3rd Armored Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division arrived in the port of Bremerhaven on Friday and began a days-long process of deploying heavy equipment including tanks and armored vehicles. The deployment is the culmination of a promised heavier armed troop presence in eastern Europe since the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014.The move was meant to reassure nervous NATO allies the United States was prepared to respond in the event of further Russian aggression in the region.The arrival of the 3,500-troop heavy brigade is part of Operation Atlantic Resolve. The Army has maintained troop deployments in the region for decades, but had allowed their numbers to lapse for months at a time as troops were rotated out of Europe without being replaced. Stars and Stripes reported the Pentagon plans to maintain the full deployment and immediately replace returning soldiers after their 9-month deployments are completed.The troops will meet in Poland and eventually will be deployed there, as well as Romania, Bulgaria, Germany and across the Baltics. Once there, they will engage in training exercises with NATO host nations.  UPI",Government News,"Jan 9, 2017",1324
" One Of Trump’s Groping Victims Just Came Forward, Campaign Is PANICKING (VIDEO)","After a tape was released in which Donald Trump was heard talking about how he loves to grope women, even married women, you can expect a rash of his victims to come forward. The first one, it appears, was with his one-time business partner, Jill Harth.The New York Times wrote about Harth s experiences on Friday. In it, she called Trump  relentless.  The man she described in the interview was a predator   a would-be rapist.She and her longtime boyfriend, George Houraney attended meetings with Trump in the early 90s. Even when sitting at a table with her boyfriend, Harth recalled Trump putting his hand up her skirt, all the way up to her crotch. I didn t know how to handle it. I would go away from him and say I have to go to the restroom. It was the escape route. Darth and Houraney had approached Trump with a business proposal that was right up his alley. They wanted to hold  calendar girl  beauty contests, an automobile show, a music competition and other events at his Atlantic City casino. They wanted Trump to do business with them, but as the evening wore on, Harth was getting more and more uncomfortable.The first sign of trouble came the day before the evening groping, in an initial business meeting in which, Harth and Houraney say, Trump spent the time asking about the breasts of the beauty contestants   real or enhanced?   and staring at Harth, then 30. At one point he asked Houraney,  Are you sleeping with her?  Houraney explained awkwardly that they were a couple, but Trump was unfazed. You know, there s going to be a problem,  Trump told Houraney, according to a 1997 sexual harassment lawsuit Harth filed against him.  I m very attracted to your girlfriend. About six weeks later, Trump gave Harth and Houraney a tour of Mar-a-Lago. They brought some of the calendar girls, but Trump wanted Harth. He pulled her into Ivanka s room (that s right, he tried to have sex in his daughter s bedroom.) I was admiring the decoration, and next thing I know he s pushing me against a wall and has his hands all over me,  Harth told me.  He was trying to kiss me. I was freaking out. Harth says she was desperately protesting, and finally managed to run out of the room and find the group again. She and Houraney left rather than stay the night, as they had intended.Harth and Houraney tried to continue the business relationship. Trump kept persisting and Harth was afraid he was going to rape her. His mind was in a totally different place than mine,  Harth recalls.  He thinks he s God s gift to women. They did end up doing business with Trump. She didn t report it to the police. Trump, not surprisingly, tried not to pay the couple, but he eventually settled out of court, but only after she agreed to withdraw a sexual harassment suit, which detailed all the allegations.The couple eventually married and then divorced. They do not speak, but their stories, according to the Times, did match. Eventually, Harth ended up dating Trump. When asked why, Harth responded: I was scared, thinking,  what am I going to do now?  she says.  When he called me and tried to work on me again, I was thinking maybe I should give this a try, maybe if he s still working on me, I should give this rich guy a chance. Here she is talking about it with The Guardian:Trump didn t respond to the New York Times, but he has publicly trashed Harth in the past, saying she was the one who was obsessed. She, surprisingly, wanted to work on his campaign, doing his hair and makeup. Still, the Times is convinced her story is true and after Friday s revelations, it wouldn t be surprising. We know Trump has zero respect for women. We know he sees them as a collection of body parts and that s it. We also know that he feels entitled to take whatever the hell he wants, even if what he wants is a human being. Trump is even accused of raping a 13-year-old. Would attempting to rape an adult be so inconceivable? It is going to be tough for Trump to spin his way out of this.Featured image Jill Harth via video screen capture | Featured image of Donald Trump via Diane Freed/Getty Images.",News,"October 8, 2016",4092
 WATCH: New Music Video Calls On Supporters To Keep Rallying For Bernie Sanders,"Bernie Sanders, the upstart and relatively unknown senator from Vermont, has captured the hearts and minds of people from all generations and walks of life, especially young Americans who are the future of tomorrow. He s ignited a passion for the political process not seen in generations. One of his gifts has been his ability to explain the major issues America is facing today and to offer actual solutions to problems. His straight talk has been refreshing in a political process that borders on the repulsive this election year, especially when it comes to GOP candidates, who often attack each other rather than the issues, making a mockery of the Republican Party and setting a bad example for America. Bernie s straight talk is summed up in a new song called Bernie, Bernie, Bernie, a rallying call for Bernie s supporters to continue the march toward the Democratic nomination.The lyrics in the song include the following: He s come to save democracy from the greed of the plutocracy and slay the phony narrative and make healthcare an imperative. About income inequality and media frivolity, they ll tell you you re just out of luck, while Bernie fights for 15 bucks. Perhaps the most attractive aspect about Bernie Sanders  candidacy is his ability to take stances on issues. Unlike most politicians, the senator actually has views on issues and offers solutions rather than what most politicians do, which is to avoid taking a stance for fear of losing votes.Whether Bernie Sanders is able to win the Democratic nomination or not, he s already changed America. For example, he taught other politicians that if you criticize Israel for its abhorrent treatment of the Palestinians,  you ll survive as a politician, despite the seditious influence that Israel lobby groups have over the American political system. Politicians will have to listen to voters who call for universal healthcare and an America first attitude and Bernie Sanders has been able to normalize this talk.The Bernie Sanders revolution is here.Watch the video here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5a2NAfsC4I]Featured image via video screenshot.",News,"May 1, 2016",2133
"The CIA Doesn’t Need To Spy On Free Thinkers, The Private Sector Does It For Free","21st Century Wire says Here s something quite  Pavlovian  to think about. What  if  it were a goal of government and their security services to ensure that we  feel  we re being watched at every turn, in every-way feasible;  but reality is not exact what we  think  it is and we re doing most of the censoring all by ourselves.Adam Garrie from The Duran takes us on an interesting journey in the below article. It also contains an important element of what we ve talked about on shows at 21st Century Wire and Alternate Current Radio s The Boiler Room regarding this  fourth wall  that people find it difficult to push through, which is  fear . The fear of losing their job, loved ones, social acceptability, and so forth.More on this article from The Duran  Adam Garrie The DuranEven prior to the release of Vault 7 from Wikileaks, people knew that so-called intelligence agencies in western states had the means to spy on their own citizens. Many also assumed that the typical illegality of such activities was of no consequence for agencies and individuals in those agencies who regard themselves as being above the law.Now that we know the CIA and other institutions have such abilities to digitally hack just about every household device from the smart phone and Smart-TV to the good old fashioned PC, the biggest question is, when do these deep state organisations implement these measures to spy on civilians and compromise their lives?The answer can be found without needing to resort to conspiracy theories nor even speculation. The answer lies in the private sector.Organisations like the CIA, MI5, FBI etc., need only do what the private sector isn t all ready doing for them and as it is, the private sector is doing a hell of a lot.If one wonders why major financial, academic, diplomatic, trading, banking, security and even artistic institutions in the West tend to have people on their payrolls who follow the  western ideological narrative , there are two reasons.The first is that people are attracted to like-minded people and by extrapolation like-minded professions.But there is a second more devious reason. Those who think outside the western box, those who  question more  simply cannot get a foot through the door. Technically, one needn t have any view on Vladimir Putin to be on the board of a major western construction company, law firm, private bank or hedge fund. These professions do not involve knowledge of Russian politics or society.  But those who have and even casually express a view of Putin or of the Arab world or of East Asia and Latin America that differs from the neo-lib/neo-con point of view, are blacklisted.Social media has made this blacklisting easier to do than ever. If two equally qualified candidates were applying for a high level position at a financial institution and one person had a picture of himself at a Hillary Clinton fundraiser on his Facebook and the other had a  Save Palestine  picture or a pro-Putin meme on his social media accounts, there would be no prizes for correctly guessing who would almost certainly get the job.In the words of George Carlin,  It s a big club and you ain t in it .The punitive blacklisting of those who don t follow the CNN/BBC/NYT script has a double effect.First of all, it keeps those who think outside the box away from positions of power in the private sector and in most western countries, without a prominent position in the business or mainstream entertainment community, achieving political office is next to impossible.Secondly, there is a powerful deterrent effect. Many people would like to post pro-Putin, pro-Donbass, pro-Syria or pro-Palestine items on social media, but they are afraid that it could cost them their job, their bonus or even their friends. In the west such things can break-up families. It happens every day. At this very movement, someone in a western country is contemplating suicide because of being on the losing end of a divorce settlement. Very sad, yet very true.This Kafkaesque reality is achieved without the CIA needing to hack people s phones or computers. The private sector does the job for them.For every tabloid story about a woman losing her job because she posted a photo of her genitals on-line, there are many more people who are professionally compromised for posting photos of patriotic Russian or Arab leaders.Throughout the 20th century, the private sector has always been happy to do the bidding of the deep state. Hollywood was largely compliant with the  red scare  tactics of the 1950s and frankly, Hollywood producers did more to censor free-speech than the drunk and soon discredited Joseph McCarthy ever could have done.Why should the CIA waste time and money to read people s emails, when their much more local boss, or chairman of  human relations  can take a quick look at Facebook and achieve the CIA s goal far more easily?The answer is that they don t. The beauty of a police state is that unquestioning citizens are deputies of the secret police and they work for free. Some do it willfully and others do it unconsciously, but they do it nevertheless Continue this article at The DuranREAD MORE WIKILEAKS NEWS AT:  21st Century Wire WIKILEAKS FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",US_News,"April 24, 2017",5277
 ‘YOU F*CKING TRAITOR’: Trump Openly Praises Putin On Twitter And Gets His Teeth Kicked In (TWEETS),"Years ago, Donald Trump tweeted that he hoped Russian dictator Vladimir Putin would become his  new best friend.  During the debates, he looked immensely sad as he said the words  he s not my best friend  when he was accused of being a Russian puppet. But now that Vladimir Putin has helped him get elected and Trump has taken to openly praising the Russian president on Twitter, it seems that they are finally ready to buy matching friendship bracelets and make it official.On Friday, Vladimir Putin announced that he would not immediately retaliate against the United States for expelling 35 suspected Russian intelligence agents. Putin, who personally directed an effort to hack Donald Trump s opposition in what the CIA has confirmed was a far-reaching effort to install Donald Trump as President, has been earning nothing but praise from The Donald, who says with a wink-and-a-nod that he totally knew nothing about anything that was happening and denies that Russia is responsible for the hacks.Putin says that instead, he will wait for Donald Trump to become President before he decides how to move forward   a fairly concrete sign that the two are working in collusion. At any point, Trump could say  no more!  At any point, he could be honest with the American people about their relationship and possibly even avoid prison time. Unfortunately, this is Donald Trump we re talking about, and he seems to be immune to scrutiny, prosecution, or anything else he deserves. Further steps toward the restoration of Russian-American relations will be built on the basis of the policy which the administration of President D. Trump will carry out, Putin said Friday.This is another time trump could have stepped up. He could have cemented his place as a strong President by telling Putin that he stands by the decision to expel 35 suspected spies. Instead, he sided with Russia yet again, praising his President for the  delay    something that will virtually ensure that Putin gets whatever he wants.Great move on delay (by V. Putin)   I always knew he was very smart!  Donald J.

Under 18 U.S. Code   2381, treason is defined as such:Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.While nothing Obama has done has come close, isn t Trump s repeated praise of Putin   a man who personally oversaw an attack on our nation   giving  aid  and  comfort  within  the United States or elsewhere?  Isn t the fact that the Russian President s  delay  until his puppet was in office   a move Trump praised    adhering to  an enemy of the United States?I won t wish death on Trump, even if his actions call for it under our nation s laws.

" Trump Said America ‘Never’ Wins, But Obama Just Took Out A Major Terrorist","On Friday, Donald Trump gave a speech to the NRA after picking up their endorsement ahead of the general election (they don t care if he has a week record on guns, as long as he s a Republican), and in his speech Trump made an insane claim about the country he hopes to lead. Trump proclaimed,  We don t win anymore. We never win. This is, of course, absurd. You can check out the hashtag #WeWinDonald for examples of America winning over the last 240 years (disclosure: I started it).But before the ink on the NRA s endorsement was even dry, along came news of another American victory. This time against the Taliban, who once harbored Osama bin Laden after the 9/11 attacks (his death, another win for America).The Pentagon says it launched an airstrike in Afghanistan Saturday targeting Mullah Akhtar Mansur, the Taliban s overall leader. Though the Pentagon is still assessing the results of the airstrike a U.S. official said Mansur was  likely killed  in the airstrike personally authorized by President Obama. Today, the Department of Defense conducted an airstrike that targeted Taliban leader Mullah Mansur in a remote area of the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region,  said Peter Cook, the Pentagon s Press Secretary in a statement released Saturday.The Pentagon press secretary also explained that Mansur has been  actively involved with planning attacks against facilities in Kabul and across Afghanistan, presenting a threat to Afghan civilians and security forces, our personnel, and Coalition partners. President Obama authorized the drone strike that appears to have killed the Taliban leader while en route to Vietnam on Air Force One.You may remember that President Obama s epic correspondent s dinner roast of Donald Trump came at the same time the Bin Laden raid was about to be executed.

The email, in which traditional Catholic beliefs are derided as  backwards , drips with contempt for Catholic Americans. Many of the most powerful elements of the conservative movement are all Catholic (many converts) from the SC and think tanks to the media and social groups,  Halpin writes to Podesta.  They must be attracted to the systematic thought and severely backwards gender relations and must be totally unaware of Christian democracy. Palmieri piles onto the Catholic bashing in her response.

 WATCH: Fox News Host Vies For Dumbest On Network While Talking About Racism And Obama,"When it comes to racial tension in America, nothing is new, it s just now being shown for what it is. With the emergence of cell phone cameras capturing police brutality, people going after the president for the color of his skin, and a Republican presidential candidate who openly says racist things, it s been getting very ugly.However, Fox News being Fox News, and Jeanine Pirro being great at the art of inflammatory rhetoric, she decided to say that we don t really live in a racist society, but President Obama somehow wants us to.Pirro decided to say: The problem is that this president is looking in a rear view mirror. It doesn t matter if he s at a prayer breakfast and says,  You Christians had it coming, and it goes back to Christ and Jim Crow and slavery. I mean, why doesn t he look forward? Then after listening to the stupid being passed around the room that somehow President Obama is to blame for increased racial tension in America, Pirro adds: We ve passed the Civil War, we ve passed the Civil Rights era, we ve got the laws in place, he is identifying things that he thinks are a problem and he doesn t get his facts straight. America was colorblind when we voted for a black president twice. The problem is primarily fixed. He keeps making it worse. They have fewer jobs now. He is just stoking the flames. Here s the thing, President Obama is very much living in the present and just because he s shining a spotlight on existing problems, doesn t mean he created them, nor were they gone. If you don t call something out, and only ignore it, it doesn t go away, but rather stews and gets deeper ingrained into the core of many people, no matter if you re racist, or have been the victim of racism.Also, there s no such thing as being colorblind, nor should we as a society seek to ignore what makes us different and unique. We need to embrace our differences, not paint over them and pretend they don t exist.Pirro is clearly vying for being the dumbest person on the network with this sort of thinking, because she s clearly missing the ability to think rationally.Watch the stupidity unfold before your eyes here: Featured image via video screen capture (MMFA)",News,"July 14, 2016",2187
 Bill Maher Insults Trump’s Supposed Masculinity And It Is GLORIOUS (VIDEO),"GOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump wants everyone to believe that he is this hyper-masculine ladies man that every guy on the planet should strive to emulate. However, as Real Time host Bill Maher points out, nothing could be further from the truth. Trump is actually more like a whiny brat than he is like anyone s version of a real man.Maher started out by asking the guests on his show how anyone could think Trump is masculine: Tell me what is masculine about Donald Trump. I don t see anything masculine about this guy   the most thin-skinned erratic non-logical whiny person in the world. That s the  old woman  stereotype. But I don t see what is so masculine about him. Then, the conversation turned to the  woman card  insults that were directed at Hillary Clinton, and one of Maher s guests, Kelly Conway, insisted that the comment was Trump putting Clinton  on notice  that she better fight for the votes from the ladies, saying: Hillary Clinton s having a hard time getting these young women in the Democratic primaries. They re voting for Bernie Sanders, so why is that? If it were just as simple as,  I m pro-choice  or  I m for pay inequality  she d be running away with it, Bill, she would be the nominee. Then again, though, Conway is a Ted Cruz supporter, so she clearly doesn t know much about being pro-women s rights, despite being a woman herself.After that ridiculous moment, Rob Reiner, who was also on Maher s panel, shut Conway down, saying: So she s not just playing the  woman card.' Indeed, she is not. She is doing well because she is qualified. Reiner later pointed out the obvious and gave Trump an epic beatdown, when he said that everything that comes out of his mouth is moronic to the Nth degree. Maher reminded Reiner that moronic or not, Trump s idiocy is authentic. Reiner replied, He is authentically moronic, yes. Yes, Trump is a moron. Hopefully, there are enough people out there who recognize this as fact and not merely opinion to keep that fool from becoming the next president of the United States.https://youtu.be/jcGyI_lRJ2oFeatured image via video screen capture",News,"April 30, 2016",2119
COPYCAT DEMS Fundraise Off Of Trump Lookalike Hat,"Can they not find something original? The Democrats are trying to fundraise off of Donald Trump s hat copycatsThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) is trying to raise money for 2016 House races with its own version of Donald Trump s infamous  Make America Great Again  hat.The DCCC s hat comes in blue, and says  Make Congress Blue Again.  Unlike various outside efforts to troll Trump ( Make America Hate Again,  et cetera), the DCCC s hat seems an earnest effort to appropriate a slogan that has proven the most effective of the cycle.Democrats, who need 30 seats to win the House, are ambivalent about Trump. Some boast that Trump would be the easiest general election opponent for Hillary Clinton; he is one of the only candidates with worse approval ratings.The DCCC has let it be known that it intends to tie vulnerable House Republicans to Trump.  You can denounce his comments but that only means so much if you would still vote for him,  a DCCC official told Roll Call recently.At the same time, Democrats are quietly worried about Trump s ability to motivate disaffected voters to come to the polls.In November, the Democratic Governors Association blamed  Trump-mania  for the surprise victory of Tea Party favorite Matt Bevin over Attorney General Jack Conway in the race for Kentucky governor:  Unfortunately, he ran into the unexpected headwinds of Trump-mania, losing to an outsider candidate in the year of the outsider. Washington Post commentator Jonathan Capehart has warned Democrats:  Trump s support is deeper than we want to admit. And if we re really being honest, we know his support doesn t just reside within the Republican Party. Thus, Trump s  I really don t give a damn  mien could prove dangerous to a Clinton campaign that prizes control. Via: Breitbart",politics,"Dec 23, 2015",1802
 Sanders Fans Break Fundraising Site After NH Primary Win (VIDEO/TWEETS),"After Bernie Sanders  win in New Hampshire on Tuesday night, so many people contributed to his campaign that ActBlue, the fundraising service used by Democratic candidates, is having trouble processing the donations. That s because during his victory speech, Sanders said: I m not going to New York City to host a fundraiser on Wall Street. Instead, I m going to hold a fundraiser right here, right now, across America. My request is please go to BernieSanders.com and contribute. So there it is, that s our fundraiser. Pretty quick,  Sanders concluded. That  fundraiser  brought in more than $5.1 million dollars in one night for Sanders.  It was a Yuuuge night for the Democratic candidate.Here is the victory speech that broke the internet:Sanders supporters took to Twitter to complain that their contributions were not going through. Act Blue is doing the best they can to deal with the new flood of donations being sent to Sanders.Huge night! Contributions are processing, receipts are a little delayed. Keep the donations coming!!  ActBlue (@actblue) February 10, 2016Our customer service team is always available for support. Just email [email protected] and someone will get back to you.  ActBlue (@actblue) February 10, 2016 ActBlue laid out what happened to cause the issues, in a blog post: Last night s spontaneous fundraiser (the one that raised $5.2 million in less than a day) broke our external processor s response systems. That s some amazing grassroots power. Like we said, we over-prepare, so we were ready for that. But the vendor started giving us a previously undocumented error message, which temporarily caused some donors to not move from the  please wait  page to the confirmation page even though their contributions were already fully processed As a certain hilarious SNL skit pointed out, we all know that Bernie Sanders  average campaign donation is $27 dollars. The people-powered campaign has already smashed President Obama s previous record for the highest number of contributions. The fact that people are making smaller donations to Sanders  campaign gives the candidate a huge advantage in terms of grassroots fundraising. Since very few people have donated the maximum amount they can, supporters can continue to donate to Sanders  campaign throughout the primary season.That might have something to do with why Sanders  raised more money than Hillary Clinton s campaign in January. In January, Sanders received $20 million dollars in donations, while Clinton raised $15 million dollars.Rest assured, anxious Berners.  The campaign s site is up and running and this shouldn t be a problem anymore. Be happy, this is  probably the best problem any candidate could ever have during an election.Featured image from video screenshot via YouTube",News,"February 10, 2016",2780
 Inaugural Cake Baker Brilliantly Schools Anti-Gay Bakers In How Protest Is Done,"Around the time same sex marriage was making headlines, a handful of cake bakers across the country threw temper tantrums and refused to bake wedding cakes for anyone who didn t pass their rigid moral test (i.e., wasn t marrying someone of the opposite sex). While these cake bakers claimed it was their First Amendment right to refuse service, the Supreme Court said it wasn t.What a difference a couple of years makes. Today, we have a new president and bigotry is now cool. One cake baker, though, was asked to bake Donald Trump s inaugural cake. They did it, but they donated the profits to a charity Trump would hate, the Human Rights Campaign.The whole situation is weird to begin with. Trump wanted an exact duplicate of the cake that celebrity chef Duff Goldman baked for the 2013 inauguration.The cake on the left is the one I made for President Obama s inauguration 4 years ago.

IS IVANKA TRYING TO CONVINCE Her Father To Break One Of His Key Campaign Promises?,"Watch this video compilation where Trump makes his stance on man-made global climate change very clear: As President Donald Trump contemplates whether to make good on his campaign promise to yank the United States out of the Paris climate accord, an unlikely lobbying force is hoping to talk him out of it: oil and coal producers.A pro-Paris bloc within the administration has recruited energy companies to lend their support to the global pact to cut greenhouse gas emissions, according to two people familiar with the effort who asked not to be identified.Cheniere Energy Inc., which exports liquefied natural gas, became the latest company to weigh in for the pact to cut greenhouse gas emissions in a letter Monday to White House energy adviser G. David Banks. Domestic energy companies are better positioned to compete globally if the United States remains a party to the Paris agreement,  Cheniere wrote. The accord  is a useful instrument for fostering demand for America s energy resources and supporting the continued growth of American industry. Exxon Mobil Corp., previously led by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BP Plc also have endorsed the pact.The industry campaign to stick with the Paris accord comes amid deep divisions in the Trump administration over the carbon-cutting agreement. Both the president s daughter, Ivanka Trump, and her husband, Jared Kushner, a White House special adviser, have urged the president to stay in the deal, along with Tillerson.Climate scientists who are against the climate treaty have written an open letter to President Trump:Breitbart News reports that in an open letter to Donald Trump, climate expert Dr. Duane Thresher has urged the President not to give in to his daughter Ivanka s misguided views on global warming and her insistence that the U.S. remain in the Paris climate agreement ratified by Barack Obama last August. Climate treaties like the Paris Agreement have little to do with climate,  Thresher notes in his letter, which he made available to Breitbart News.  They are about economic competition. As the greatest economy in the history of the world, other countries will do anything to cripple the United States. Countries like China will agree to anything in these treaties and simply ignore their obligations while demanding the United States fulfill theirs,  Thresher said, calling belief in global warming a  popular delusion. In his letter, Dr. Thresher also reminded President Trump of his campaign promises that led many Americans to vote for him. We who voted for you consider stopping this climate change madness one of your key promises,  Thresher said.  If you renege on it you will lose me and many others as supporters. After Trump s election, in fact, a number of climate change skeptics were emboldened to take more public stands against the politically imposed  scientific consensus  of global warming, welcoming a new era of free debate about a hotly contested issue.Scientists unconvinced by the party line on climate change applauded Trump s appointment of Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to head up the Environmental Protection Agency as an important step away from climate alarmism.Even if Trump caves and stays in the Paris climate agreement, Thresher says, it won t win him any friends.  Your opponents are not going to support you; they ll just taunt you as being a flip-flopper,  he said.",politics,"Apr 24, 2017",3419

She s one tough cookie!Pamela Geller: He hates me more than the terrorists so I can t take much of what he says seriously.Fox is imploding right now. Pam Geller is attacking Geraldo Rivera for saying he needs to take a shower after she appears on the network.   pic.twitter.com/tYTvvSX5z8  Thomas Bishop (@bishopk0s) November 2, 2017Remember that Geraldo insulted Geller when she was almost killed by two jihadists in Texas Geller has long been a target of radical Islamists. Her life has been threatened but she keeps up the fight:Pam Geller has been spot on when speaking about the truth of jihadists. She spoke with The Hollywood Reporter about how she feels Hollywood is  in the pocket  of jihadis. Very interesting read and lots to learn from this very brave lady:Pamela Geller has been on a rampage against radical Islam for years, beginning notably in 2010 by spearheading of the opposition to what she called the  Ground Zero Mega Mosque  near the site of the destroyed World Trade Center. Her most recent controversy was the organization of a  Draw the Prophet Muhammad  contest in Texas.At the event, two self-described jihadists shot a security guard before police killed them. Then, on June 2, police killed a knife-wielding Muslim man in Boston whose goal was allegedly to behead Geller in retaliation for the contest. Even though the contest was a major news story, few media outlets published the winning cartoon. Geller s group, American Freedom Defense Initiative, put the image on billboards, 100 of which debuted in St. Louis on Monday with the tagline  Support Free Speech.  She spoke to The Hollywood Reporter about how the (largely hostile) media is portraying these events.Why are you being overly provocative, purposely insulting Muslims?I am not being overly provocative or purposely insulting Muslims. Islamic jihadists, not I, made Muhammad cartoons the flash point for the defense of the freedom of speech when they began killing over them. If we don t stand against them on that point, the only alternative is surrender and submission. I did not make the cartoons a flash point, the jihadis did.But if you just don t insult their prophet, they ll leave you alone, no?No. The death penalty for insulting Muhammad is just one aspect of Sharia. There is much, much more of infidel behavior that violates Sharia. If we refrain from drawing Muhammad, more demands to adhere to other aspects of Sharia will follow. Millions are suffering or have been slaughtered under Islamic Sharia law in Muslim countries. Islamic supremacists mean to impose it in the West.There is no hate speech exception to the First Amendment.  Hate speech  is a subjective judgment. If it were outlawed, the authority with the power to decide what constitutes it would have the power to control the public debate.  If a group will not bear being offended without resorting to violence, that group will rule unopposed while everyone else lives in fear, while other groups curtail their activities to appease the violent group. This results in the violent group being able to tyrannize the others. Cartoons have been used as satire since the beginning of satire   especially in our country   and no one gets a pass. Not the Pope of Rome, president of the United States or Hollywood s biggest movie stars.  If you don t like it, don t look at it, boycott the network that airs it, don t buy the publication, make counter-images, make a million, fine, but you have to adjust to us, not we to you, and if that s too much, don t come here. Threaten violence? Commit violence? The consequences are yours to bear.It seems many media pundits who claim allegiance to the First Amendment aren t persuaded by your arguments.They are afraid of being killed by Islamic jihadists and camouflage their fear and cowardice as  respect  for Islam and Muslims.Are there any TV hosts who have been particularly hostile to you during interviews?Yes. Martha MacCallum, Erin Burnett, Alisyn Camerota, Chris Cuomo   although he let me speak and make my case.How about behind your back?Yes. Bill O Reilly and Laura Ingraham. They said I was insulting the entire religion, one held by our moderate allies such as Egypt and Qatar. They are wrong in assuming that we must submit to Sharia to placate moderates, rather than that moderates need to accept the freedom of speech. Roman Catholics don t like their religion mocked or the mockery of other religions, but Roman Catholics don t kill when their religion is mocked   and so no one talks about  provoking  them or  respecting  them. In any pluralistic society, we have to put up with being offended and even with our core beliefs being mocked. Roman Catholics have learned that. Mormons and others have learned that   look at The Book of Mormon on Broadway. Why must we condescend to Muslims and think they cannot learn that? It s the low expectation of soft bigotry.So this isn t entirely a partisan issue where conservatives stand by you and liberals don t?No. Chris Hayes stuck up for me on MSNBC. This is not a left/right split, it is a free person/slave split.Did any TV host say something that struck you as particularly wrongheaded?They all say I have the right to draw Muhammad but shouldn t out of respect. They don t seem to realize that any surrender on this point will only be seen by the jihadists as a victory and embolden them to make more demands. CNN s Erin Burnett said I relished being the target of a beheading. It s madness. Who self-promotes to get killed?So you re not purposely courting danger, as Burnett and others have insinuated?Of course not. I love life. But I will not live as a slave.Are there any TV hosts you d like to face off with but who won t have you on?Bill O Reilly. I expect he knows he would be shown up.We know about the man arrested who intended to behead you. Any other threats you can share?I have received many threats. The FBI and NYPD are aware of them and on the case.Anyone in Hollywood reach out to you to offer support?No.Should Hollywood care about threats against you?They may think they re exempt, but they aren t. Islamic supremacists will be demanding they adhere to Sharia as well. Of course, most producers already are careful not to show anything that might offend Muslims, including accurate representations of jihad plotting and activity, so Hollywood is mostly already in their pocket. But this is their issue, and the entertainment industry should be on the front lines in the information battle space. The jihadists aren t just coming for me, they are coming for all of us that believe in freedom.So why do you think Hollywood, which routinely claims to push the envelope in its art, hasn t supported you?They re afraid of being ostracized.Your  Draw Muhammad  event certainly got a lot of news coverage. Should mainstream media outlets have published the winning cartoon?Every media outlet should publish the Muhammad cartoons. They can t kill us all. By kowtowing to violent intimidation, they are inviting more of it. Instead, they should be showing that we will all stand together for free speech. If the media had published the Danish cartoons back in 2005, this would never have become an issue. The submission by media, entertainment and academic elites empowered the savages.The Southern Poverty Law Center included you on their list of  hate groups.  Are they right?Of course not. They re the hate group, using that label to demonize and stigmatize all who don t share their hard-left agenda. The SPLC smear machine does not profile jihad groups, but they target and libel patriots, veterans, Tea Party organizations and other groups that work in defense of freedom. They named [Republican presidential contender] Ben Carson as a hate group. That should tell you everything you need to know about them. Their [sympathizers] have violently attacked family groups, and one tried to assassinate Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council. And a few months back an SPLC [sympathizer] killed three Muslims in a parking dispute in North Carolina.Email: Paul.Bond@THR.com",politics,"Nov 1, 2017",8235
 Jimmy Kimmel Compares Trump And Cruz and The Results Are HILARIOUS (VIDEO),"While many Republicans are lining up behind Ted Cruz because they say that Trump s policies are too extreme, here s some news for them: These two clowns are one in the same. The only difference is Ted Cruz seems to be a bit more slick and polite about his racism than the bombastic Trump. Jimmy Kimmel proved that on his show Jimmy Kimmel Live with an  ad  he says was created by Mitt Romney which urges Republicans to vote for Ted Cruz. Kimmel said: The Republican establishment seems to be doing all it can do behind the scenes to topple Donald Trump and in front of the scenes too. Mitt Romney, in particular, has his magic underwear in a bunch when it comes to Donald Trump. He s asking voters to stop what he calls Trumpism and support Ted Cruz. In fact Mitt released this powerful ad that really tells the differences between Trump and Cruz in a very easy to follow way. The  ad  then goes on to show the striking similarities between the two candidates. Whether it s building a wall or deporting 11 million immigrants, the candidates are one in the same. The candidates also agree on no gun control, ending abortion, repealing Obamacare, and oppressing American Muslims.So, why the uproar about Trump? Trump is simply more vocal and bombastic about his plans for America than the creepy Ted Cruz, who comes off more professional but is just as dangerous.Watch the video here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGnwlPAZjpM] Featured image via video screenshot.",News,"March 24, 2016",1472
CHILLING TESTIMONY Of Brave 7th Grader At TX School Board Meeting: “Today I was given an assignment at school that questioned my faith and said that ‘God is not real'” [VIDEO],"This indoctrination into a godless society is happening at every stage in our child s development. From grade school through college and even in grad school, educators are working overtime to remove God, values and morals from our children s lives. They are blurring the lines between right and wrong in an effort to make everyone the same. The end result will be callous, heartless, self-centered human beings with no moral compass and no purpose in life. How long will we remain quiet and chose to ignore this abomination?KATY, Texas   A Texas seventh-grader is standing up for her religious beliefs after she alleges her teacher forced students to deny that God is real, and threatened them with failing grades if they don t agree.Jordan Wooley, a seventh grade student at West Memorial Junior High School in the Katy Independent School District, testified at a school board meeting last night about an assignment in her reading class that caused a serious controversy, and expressed frustration about her teacher s atheist indoctrination. Today I was given an assignment in school that questioned my faith and told me that God was not real. Our teacher had started off saying that the assignment had been giving problems all day. We were asked to take a poll to say whether God is fact, opinion or a myth and she told anyone who said fact or opinion was wrong and God was only a myth,  Wooley told board members.Students immediately objected, Wooley said, but the teacher refused to consider their position.The teacher,  started telling kids they were completely wrong and that when kids argued we were told we would get in trouble. When I tried to argue, she told me to prove it, and I tried to reference things such as the Bible and stories I have read before from people who have died and went to heaven but came back and told their stories, and she told me both were just things people were doing to get attention. I know it wasn t just me who was affected by it. My friend, she went home and started crying. She was supposed to come with me but she didn t know if she could  because she was so upset, Wooley said.The teen explained she spoke with other students in the class who were marked down because they believe God is real, as well as compromises proposed by students to avoid rejecting their faith. Another student asked the teacher if we could put what we believe in the paper, and she said we could   but you would fail the paper if you do,  Wooley told the board.  I had known before that our schools aren t really supposed to teach us much about religion or question religion. When I asked my teacher about it she said it doesn t have anything to do with religion because the problem is just saying there is no God. Wooley was accompanied to the meeting by her mother, Chantel Wooley, who texted with her daughter about the assignment earlier in the day and posted a video to Facebook about the incident after school. Hey mom so in reading we were required to say that God is just a myth,  Jordan texted her mother shortly before 3 p.m. Monday.  I thought if a question was against our religion that we could put what we think is true but we got in trouble for saying He is true. Wait what? Myth?  Chantel Wooley replied. We had to deny God is real. Yeah, we had to say he was just a myth,  Jordan wrote. You got in trouble?  Chantel questioned. Yeah she told me I was wrong bc I put it was fact,  Jordan wrote. What did you say?  Chantel texted. I said he is real and she said that can t be proven,  Jordan replied. And what happened?  Chantel wrote. I still put fact on my paper,  Jordan texted.Jordan told school board members her family contacted the school principal, who promised to speak with the teacher and investigate the incident. Board members also vowed to  look into it,  but said school administrators should first focus on addressing the issue.They also thanked Wooley for voicing her concerns.In a Facebook video posted to Chantel Wooley s profile, Jordan explained the situation in more detail.// <![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]>Jordan Wooley addresses Katy ISD re: controversial assignment  Bravery!Posted by Education Action Group on Tuesday, October 27, 2015 Basically, a lot of people said it was true and real, and she told us we were all wrong,  Jordan said.  She told us it was a commonplace assertion, just a myth, and lot of people got upset about it. I called my friend to see how she felt about it, and she was just crying,  Wooley continued. And how did that make you feel?  an off-camera voice questions. Like she was taking away my religion, what I believe is true,  the teen replied.Texas education activist Alice Linahan told EAGnews the incident, and how district officials respond, could be an especially important indicator of things to come in the Lone Star state.Katy ISD Superintendent Alton Frailey, president of the national American Association of School Administrators, was a central figure in crafting the state s education standards as the former president of the Texas Association of School Administrators.Frailey is now working to expand similar standards nationally, Linahan said, and is reportedly on Texas Gov. Greg Abbott s short list to replace education Commissioner Michael Williams, who resigned last week.Linahan pointed to standards Frailey help craft that require a teacher  understands how to connect concepts and use differing perspectives to engage learners in critical thinking, creativity, and collaborative problem solving related to authentic local and global issues,  as evidence that the state standards and closely aligned national Common Core standards divert focus from core subjects to less important issues.

DEMOCRATS THREATEN KIDS EDUCATION: CHICAGO TEACHERS UNION DEMANDS RAISES AS Chicago Public Schools Run Out Of Money In One Week,"It s painful to watch the stupidity and irresponsibility of the Democrats who run the city of Chicago along with Chicago Teachers Union president, Karen Lewis, one of the most hard-core radical, leftist s in the business. It s T-minus one week for Chicago Public Schools.As schools let out for the summer, CPS administrators are scrambling to come up with a more than $600 million teacher pension payment due at the end of the month and the district has zero reserves, according to media reports.The problem is further compounded by a more than $1 billion school budget shortfall for the next fiscal year and an angry teachers union hell bent on securing another raise the district can t afford. With no plan, no money and no where to turn, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel seems to be focused solely on a state bailout as the solution. Springfield has to step up and help in this case, not only as it relates to just the pension payment, (but also) the educational opportunities of our children,  Emanuel said, according to the Chicago Tribune.  Because a payment will then begin to impact   the classroom. And CTU could soon partner with its mortal enemies at City Hall to lobby state lawmakers for more money. Right now, the district needs us,  CTU VP Jesse Sharkey told the news site.  The politics of (Chicago Mayor) Rahm Emanuel going to Springfield are a lot different than the politics of Rahm Emanuel and (CTU President) Karen Lewis going to Springfield. The dire financial situation comes amid a federal investigation into a $20 million no-bid contract to a previous employer of former CPS superintendent Barbara Byrd-Bennett, who resigned this month. It feels like a complete mess,  Better Government Association senior editor Sarah Karp told ABC 7.Karp doesn t think recently elected Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, who ran on a platform of fiscal restraint and criticized union influence in Illinois, is receptive to calls for a bailout. He previously suggested that bankruptcy may be the best way out for CPS, ABC 7 reports. Now, Chicago Public Schools does not have somebody in the State House that is a Democrat or is seemingly sympathetic at all to what s going on here,  Karp said.Meanwhile, school ended for the summer on Friday, and principals around the city are left scratching their heads in planning for next school year. Normally you do your planning in the summer and you can t do too much planning without the actual dollar amount,  Coles Language Academy principal Jeff Dase told ABC 7.Dase said many Chicago principals are concerned that the budget turmoil, and looming possibility of layoffs and program cuts, could convince many of the city s teachers to seek jobs elsewhere.The Tribune reports the city council could authorize CPS to increase taxes on residents, or secure some sort of bailout, or negotiate concessions with CTU, but not even all three combined could put the budget back on track. And then there s another $228 million payment coming due for costs related to interest rate swaps on the district s debt.    (E)ven if CPS wins concession from the City Council, state lawmakers and CTU, the district won t be able to close its annual $1 billion budget gap, according to a May 22 report by Ernst & Young, which spent four weeks meeting with school finance officials and analyzing budget documents,  the Tribune reports. The report shows that even with a capital improvement tax, a separate, even-larger property tax increase, additional state aid, increased state funding of teacher pensions, concessions from the CTU and $150 million with of budget cuts, CPS would still face an annual $350 million shortfall. Next June s teacher pension payment is set to balloon to $700 million. Via: EAG News",Government News,"Jun 24, 2015",3732
LOVE AT FIRST LEAK! Former “Baywatch” Star Pamela Anderson Becomes Regular Visitor Of Wikileaks Founder Julian Assange: “I think he’s quite sexy”,"Julian Assange became a computer hacker in his teen years. Assange got married when he was 18 and has a son. He and his wife separated and in 1999, after a protracted court battle, he reached a custody agreement with his wife.Assange gained worldwide fame and became a household name after he released hacked DNC emails shining a light on the ugly and questionable inner workings of Hillary, her campaign and many in the Democratic Party.Assange, who has been living in the embassy for four years after he was granted political asylum by Ecuador, came under fire this week after a 8,000-plus-file dump of CIA secrets was posted on WikiLeaks.Vice President Pence Thursday vowed to go after the web site, saying the leak was  one of the most significant compromises of national security in recent memory. Apparently Baywatch  star Pamela Anderson has a  thing  for  the world s most famous leaker, Julian Assange. Anderson s gone from slow motion runs on the beach to mysterious late night visits to the embassy where WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is holed up.Anderson was most recently spotted entering the Ecuadorian safe space in London Thursday night wearing a camel overcoat, snug black top   and either a really short skirt, or no pants at all.Anderson, 49, is a regular at the facility, coyly smiling for photographers as she struts inside to see Assange, 45, whose rogue outfit has dumped some of the US government s most closely guarded secrets.She refused to deny the dating rumors   saying he intellectually stimulates her more than all her  ex-husbands and lovers combined. I think he s quite sexy,  she wrote in a blog post on Thursday.  He has tremendous strength and stamina   though vulnerable. Hard to imagine him that way   as capable as he is. But, he is up against the biggest super powers in the world. Speaking to John Bishop on The Nightly Show this week, she described meeting Assange last year through British fashion designer Vivienne Westwood. We started seeing each other every month, and now we see each other a lot more regularly,  she said, according to The Sun. I do really think he s one of the most important people in the world, and I think what he does is historic. It s very important,  Anderson added.  He s very brave and he sacrificed a lot for all of us. NYP",left-news,"Mar 11, 2017",2300
JUST IN: TRUMP Will Remove “Climate Change” From List Of National Security Threats,"Thank goodness we finally have a President who refuses to dump our taxpayer funds into climate scam that our former President actually identified as a national security threat According to The Federalist, The Trump administration will reverse course from previous Obama administration policy, eliminating climate change from a list of national security threats. The National Security Strategy to be released on Monday will emphasize the importance of balancing energy security with economic development and environmental protection, according to a source who has seen the document and shared excerpts of a late draft. Climate policies will continue to shape the global energy system,  a draft of the National Security Strategy slated to be released on Monday said.  U.S. leadership is indispensable to countering an anti-growth, energy agenda that is detrimental to U.S. economic and energy security interests. Given future global energy demand, much of the developing world will require fossil fuels, as well as other forms of energy, to power their economies and lift their people out of poverty. During his successful campaign, Trump mocked Obama s placement of climate change in the context of national security. Here s a sample of his approach from a campaign speech in Hilton Head, South Carolina, in late 2015:So Obama s always talking about the global warming, that global warming is our biggest and most dangerous problem, OK? No, no, think of it. I mean, even if you re a believer in global warming, ISIS is a big problem, Russia s a problem, China s a problem. We ve got a lot of problems. By the way, the maniac in North Korea is a problem. He actually has nuclear weapons, right? That s a problem.We ve got a lot of problems. We ve got a lot of problems. That s right, we don t win anymore. He said we want to win. We don t win anymore. We re going to win a lot   if I get elected, we re going to win a lot. (Applause)We re going to win so much   we re going to win a lot. We re going to win a lot. We re going to win so much you re all going to get sick and tired of winning. You re going to say oh no, not again. I m only kidding. You never get tired of winning, right? Never. (Applause)But think of it. So Obama s talking about all of this with the global warming and the   a lot of it s a hoax, it s a hoax. I mean, it s a money-making industry, OK? It s a hoax, a lot of it. And look, I want clean air and I want clean water. That s my global   I want clean, clean crystal water and I want clean air. And we can do that, but we don t have to destroy our businesses, we don t have to destroy our  And by the way, China isn t abiding by anything. They re buying all of our coal; we can t use coal anymore essentially. They re buying our coal and they re using it. Now when you talk about the planet, it s so big out there   we re here, they re there, it s like they re our next door neighbor, right, in terms of the universe.The draft of the National Security Strategy makes this approach policy, emphasizing national security and economic growth over climate change.President Obama made climate change, and the burdensome regulations that accompany its focus, a primary focus of his administration, including in his National Security Strategy released in 2015.  [W]e are working toward an ambitious new global climate change agreement to shape standards for prevention, preparedness, and response over the next decade,  that report said.Watch Barack Obama explain how  climate change  is national security threat: By contrast, President Trump s National Security Strategy will focus on conventional and immediate national security risks. The draft says, in part:North Korea seeks the capability to kill millions of Americans with nuclear weapons. Iran supports terrorist groups and openly calls for our destruction. Jihadist terrorist organizations such as ISIS and al Qaeda are determined to attack the United States and radicalize Americans with their hateful ideology. States and non-state actors undermine social order with drug and human trafficking networks, which drive violent crimes and cause thousands of American deaths each year . Strengthening control over our borders and immigration system is central to national security, economic prosperity, and the rule of law. Terrorists, drug traffickers, and criminal cartels exploit porous borders and threaten U.S. security and public safety. These actors adapt quickly to outpace our defenses.As for climate change, the draft report says  The United States will remain a global leader in reducing traditional pollution, as well as greenhouse gases, while growing its economy. This achievement, which can serve as model to other countries, flows from innovation, technology breakthroughs, and energy efficiency gains  not from onerous regulation.

FEMA DENIES AID TO BALTIMORE FOR RIOT DAMAGES – MAYOR PLANS TO APPEAL,"Remember this? Mayor Rawlings-Blake says that the Baltimore rioters needed room to destroy  The Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied a state request for disaster aid to cover the costs associated with the rioting and unrest that broke out in Baltimore after the death of Freddie Gray.W. Craig Fugate, FEMA s administrator, wrote in a June 12 letter to Gov. Larry Hogan that federal disaster aid was  not appropriate  for such an event. Therefore, I must inform you that your request for a major disaster declaration is denied,  Fugate wrote.Spokeswoman Erin Montgomery said Friday that the Hogan administration  is reviewing FEMA s response and will make a determination about the appropriate next steps, including a possible appeal. A disaster declaration would allow public agencies and residents affected by the unrest to seek reimbursement for related costs.City officials have reserved $20 million to cover direct costs, including overtime for police and firefighters, damage to city-owned property and repaying other jurisdictions for police and other assistance.Howard Libit, a spokesman for Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, said Friday that the city is working on an appeal. We re told we have 30 days to appeal,  he said.  We re working with the federal delegation and Obama administration officials to assess what we might do to become eligible for reimbursement. Henry J. Raymond, Baltimore s finance director, said in May that the city was covering the costs from its rainy-day fund but hoped for federal reimbursement of up to 75 percent of the costs.In his request for aid, Hogan had cited Baltimore s preliminary estimate that the rioting and looting in April and the five-night citywide curfew had an economic impact of $30.5 million. That included the loss of conventions, hospitality and leisure spending, and tourism from Orioles games that were closed to the public or moved to Florida.

 A Reminder Of How Much The NRA Has Spent On Trump In Wake Of ANOTHER Mass Shooting,"At least 27 people, including children, were murdered at a mostly-white church in Texas this morning, and we re already hearing  thoughts, prayers, and may God be with them,  from all the people who get millions in support from the NRA. Trump himself tweeted,  May God be w/ the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas.  He added that law enforcement was on the scene and he was  monitoring the situation from Japan. However, it s extremely unlikely we ll hear calls from him about reviewing our incredibly lax gun laws anytime soon like he ranted about needing tighter immigration controls following the terrorist attack in New York City. And here s a possible reason why: The NRA spent tens of millions getting Trump elected.In 2016, the NRA s total support for Trump was over $30 million. The next highest spending amount was for Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina with a paltry $6.3 million.Source: Opensecrets.orgTrump is very easily bought, and he also rewards those who show him their undying loyalty. That s evidenced by every one of his cabinet picks. His promises to  drain the swamp  disappeared as soon as he was able to start rewarding his most loyal subjects.By contrast, those who haven t shown sufficient loyalty are attacked, dragged through the mud, and sometimes even fired. Trump can t fire the NRA, but even if he could, he wouldn t because they re essentially giving each other mutual blow jobs here. In fact, one of the first bills Trump signed into law was one that made it easier for people who are mentally incapable of caring for themselves get guns. He also returned their favor by appearing at their annual conference   something no president had done since Ronald Reagan. He s even said,  You came through for me, and I am going to come through for you. So can we really expect Trump to call for a review of our impossibly lax gun laws? No. Because then the NRA spend their millions on someone else.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images",News,"November 5, 2017",1972
MN Taxpayers To Pay Rent For African Refugees While Visiting Homeland…Freeing Them From Financial Burden,"We re just wondering if the state of MN has ever considered giving US veterans the same consideration? Or is this an exclusive offer given to African refugees because they contribute so much to our economy or wait do they? In the USA, 91.4% of Muslim  refugees  are on food stamps and 68.3% are taking Cash Welfare. Here s a chart to show how much refugees are contributing to the overall economy. Via: Senator Jeff SessionsThe Minneapolis Housing Authority passed legislation this week that will allow migrants to skip their monthly rent in Minnesota when they travel back home to East Africa.The move was sought by local East African immigrants. Immigrants traveling for 30 to 90 days could apply for a hardship which will reduce their rent to $75 a month while they are gone. The Star Tribune reported:Public housing residents in Minneapolis will no longer need to pay their normal monthly rent when travel abroad erases their income, a change particularly sought by East African immigrants.The board of the Minneapolis Public Housing Authority approved this week reverting to its previous policy of collecting only minimal rent during extended absences. The change takes effect once approved by federal housing officials, which is expected by year s end.Abdi Warsame, a City Council member, told the board that the policy in place for the past five years works a particular hardship on elderly East Africans who must save for long periods if they want to visit their homelands. He said that many receive federal Supplemental Security Income, which is halted when the recipient is outside the United States.Yet the policy required people to keep paying rent, which is income-based. Travelers gone for 30 to 90 days could apply for a hardship, which meant that they paid the minimum $75 monthly rent during their absence, but were required to make up the difference between that and their normal rent over the next year or two.

 Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi Demands Sessions Resign Over Russian Perjury,"For months Donald Trump and his top staffers have sworn that no one in the campaign had contact with the Russian government while it was in the middle of engaging in a cyber attack against Democrats. Trump s new Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, even testified under oath that he had not spoke to Russian officials while working on Trump s campaign.And that lie just got exposed.Now high ranking Democrats including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Ranking Member of the House Oversight Committee Elijah Cummings have both called on Sessions to immediately step down. Pelosi s statement was a scorched earth condemnation of Sessions, Trump, and the entire administration which seems hell-bent on covering up its connections to Russia no matter what. Jeff Sessions lied under oath during his confirmation hearing before the Senate. Under penalty of perjury, he told the Senate Judiciary Committee,  I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians.  We know that statement is false.Attorney General Sessions has never had the credibility to oversee the FBI investigation of senior Trump officials  ties to the Russians. This is why Democrats have consistently called for Sessions to recuse himself from any oversight of the investigation.Now, after lying under oath about his own communications with the Russians, the Attorney General must resign. There must be an independent, bipartisan, outside commission to investigate the Trump political, personal, and financial connection to the Russians. Cummings was equally forceful in calling for Sessions to resign, citing the fact that Michael Flynn, Trump s disgraced former National Security Advisor, had already resigned for a similar offense and Sessions  was that much worse because he kept quiet about it even after that scandal.Sessions should have the self-respect to resign, because he may be also be facing a conviction. At least one former White House ethics lawyer has already stated that he believes what Sessions did could easily send him to prison.Misleading the Senate in sworn testimony about one own contacts with the Russians is a good way to go to jail https://t.co/qH0s6sTMJ9  Richard W.

 Trump ‘Promises’ To Fix Black People’s Problems And Gets Spectactularly Owned For It On Twitter,"Donald Trump must really think black people are stupid.The Republican nominee has been making a series of pathetic attempts to reach out to black voters on the campaign trail recently as his poll numbers continue to implode. What the hell do you have to lose,  Trump asked black voters in front of a white audience earlier this week as he claimed they all live in neighborhoods that are  war zones,  have bad schools, are unemployed, and live in poverty.Well, Trump took to Twitter on Thursday and made yet another pathetic effort to fool black voters into thinking that he actually gives a damn about them.Once again, Trump claimed poverty and crime are up in African-American communities while claiming that employment is down.  I will fix it, promise,  he tacked on at the end.So many in the African-American community are doing so badly, poverty and crime way up, employment and jobs way down: I will fix it, promise  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 25, 2016Of course, Trump is talking out of his ass.As it turns out the black poverty rate over the last two decades favors Hillary Clinton and is really damning for Republicans.According to BlackDemographics.com: During the decade of the 1990s while the nation was experiencing an economic boom the poverty rate of Black families dropped from 29% in 1990 to 19% in 2000 virtually cutting the disparity in half. The economic downturn in the decade from 2000 to 2010 caused the increase of the Black family poverty rate to 24%. Since 2010 the Black family poverty rate began to decrease sightly reaching 23% in 2014, however the disparity has remained relatively unchanged since 2000.As we all know, Bill Clinton was president in the 1990s and he presided over a strong economy that benefited just about everyone, including African-Americans. But then George W. Bush took over and black families began to slip back below the poverty line, especially during the Great Recession.In addition, Trump over-exaggerates the crime in black communities and his claim that the unemployment rate among blacks is up is bullshit, too. In fact, it s been cut nearly in half since 2011.So Twitter ripped Trump a new one. .@realDonaldTrump just like you  fixed  the availability of all those apartment buildings so black tenants couldn t rent from you??

OBAMA WARNS: Crackdown On Terrorism In U.S. Would Violate Iran Deal,"Never mind that Iran continues to violate Obama s lopsided deal Senior Obama administration officials are expressing concern that congressional attempts to tighten laws preventing terrorists from entering the United States could violate the Iran nuclear agreement and prompt Tehran to walk away from the agreement.Congress is considering measures that would tighten the Visa Waiver Program to make it harder for potential terrorists to legally enter the United States by increasing restrictions on individuals who have travelled to countries with prominent terrorist organizations from bypassing security checks upon entering the United States.Iranian officials have in recent days repeatedly issued threatening statements to the Obama administration, saying that such moves would violate the nuclear agreement, and the Obama administration last week conveyed the Iranian anger to American lawmakers.Stephen Mull, the State Department official in charge of implementing the Iran deal, warned the Senate Foreign Relations Committee late last week that these congressional efforts  could have a very negative impact on the deal. Under the revised law, which came in the week of a deadly terrorist attack in California, individuals who have travelled to Iran a lead sponsor of global terrorism would no longer be eligible to participate in the Visa Waiver Program, which permits individuals from 38 partner nations to more easily enter the United States.Congress remains concerned that gaps in the program could prevent federal law enforcement officials from detecting terror-tied individuals before they are granted entrance to U.S. soil.However, a portion of the Iran nuclear deal mandates that the United States not take any action that could harm Iran s economic relationships with other countries. Iranian officials maintain that the new restrictions violate this passage of the deal.Ali Larijani, the speaker of Iran s parliament, said last week that these tightened measures  are aimed at harassment  and that they  blatantly violate the nuclear agreement,  according to comments carried by the Iranian state-controlled press.Larijani warned that this action will detonate the deal before it has even been implemented. If the Americans pursue the plan, they will destroy an achievement with their own hands since it is against the [nuclear deal] and it will trouble them,  he warned.Rep. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.) echoed these concerns last week when he questioned Mull during a Senate hearing.Visa waiver reform efforts include  a naming of Iran such that individuals who have travelled to Iran will no loner be eligible for the visa waiver program,  Murphy said.  There has been a suggestion because there is an element of the agreement that obligates us to not to take steps that would stop economic relations between other nations and Iran that we could perhaps be in jeopardy of breaching the agreement. Mull agreed with this assessment. I have heard from very senior, and Secretary [of State John] Kerry has as well, from very senior officials of differing European allies of ours that it could have a very negative impact on the deal,  he said.Sources working with Congress on the Iran deal criticized the Obama administration for attempting to stymie increased action on terrorism due to its desire to preserve the nuclear deal. According to the Obama administration s latest interpretation, the nuclear deal allows Iran to test ballistic missiles in violation of international law, but does not allow Congress to prevent terrorists from coming into the United States,  Omri Ceren, the managing director of press and strategy at The Israel Project, a D.C.-based organization that works with journalists on Middle East issues, told the Washington Free Beacon.Seyed Araqchi, Iran s deputy foreign minister, also warned that Iran is prepared to  take action  against the United States for implementing visa restrictions.Iran s latest threat to break the deal comes amid numerous Iranian provocations, including multiple tests of advanced ballistic missiles, acts prohibited under United Nations Security Council resolutions.The Obama administration repeatedly said that, while it does not agree with those launches, they do not violate the nuclear deal.Via: WFB",politics,"Dec 21, 2015",4269

For the most part, the media mocked anyone who even suggested Hillary had a part in the Benghazi attack that took the lives of 4 innocent Americans. They ignored and even laughed at the brave victims who came forward and publicly accused Hillary of  enabling  her sexual predator husband, while referring to her as a  champion of women and girls . The media did everything in their power to push Hillary s email scandal to the bottom of the news pile, but were finally forced to address it when FBI Director James Comey came forward and announced his investigation into her unsecured email server that was being used for official State Department business.After several months of keeping a pretty low profile, Hillary is coming out with excuses about why she lost the election. The timing is a bit suspicious however after an inside account of Hillary s disastrous campaign was just released by an insider who wrote a tell-all book titled  Shattered  that offers a less than charitable view of the real Hillary Clinton.Watch Hillary in her latest video, as she hilariously blames the press for losing the election:Here s the second part of Hillary s appearance where she tells the crowd she was on her  way to victory  until FBI Director James Comey ruined it for her:Politico   In addition to receiving far more network coverage, the networks spent far more airtime focusing on the personal controversies involving Trump, such as his treatment of women, than controversies surrounding Clinton, such as her email practices or the Clinton Foundation.For the study, MRC analyzed all 588 evening news stories that either discussed or mentioned the presidential campaign on the ABC, CBS and NBC evening newscasts from July 29 through October 20 (including weekends). Of the total newscasts, the networks devoted 29 percent of their time to the campaign. The study did not include comments from the campaigns or candidates themselves, instead focusing on what the correspondents, anchors, expert commentators, and voters on the street said in order to try and hone in on any sort of slant from the networks.Though neither candidate was necessarily celebrated, Clinton largely just stayed out of the line of fire. Even when they were critical of Hillary Clinton   for concealing her pneumonia, for example, or mischaracterizing the FBI investigation of her e-mail server   network reporters always maintained a respectful tone in their coverage,  the study found.  This was not the case with Trump, who was slammed as embodying  the politics of fear,  or a  dangerous  and  vulgar   misogynistic bully  who had insulted vast swaths of the American electorate. It doesn t really surprise me, I think most people got the sense that this was a hostile place for Trump, the establishment media,  said Rich Noyes, director of research for the MRC.  I would say looking at the big picture, the Trump campaign and to a lesser extent Republicans in general wanted this to be a referendum on Obama   the Clinton campaign, the Democrats, once Trump was picked wanted this be a referendum on Donald Trump. Television news has for the past 12 weeks has been giving the Democrats the campaign they wanted. ",politics,"May 3, 2017",3890
TAXPAYER FUNDED OPERATION CONSERVATIVE TAKE DOWN : DOJ Awards MI State Univ Huge Grant To Study ‘Far Right” Groups Use Of Social Media,"How many American taxpayer dollars have already been used by the Obama regime to spy on, discredit and dismantle conservative groups like the Tea Party? Is anyone else beginning to feel like the Obama regime is one big union who forces members to pay dues that are used to fund, and ensure the success of the Democrat party? The Department of Justice is concentrating on  far-right  groups in a new study of social media usage aimed at combatting violent extremism.The Justice Department s National Institute of Justice (NIJ) awarded Michigan State University $585,719 for the study, which was praised by Eric Holder, the former attorney general, earlier this year. There is currently limited knowledge of the role of technology and computer mediated communications (CMCs), such as Facebook and Twitter, in the dissemination of messages that promote extremist agendas and radicalize individuals to violence,  according to the NIJ grant.  The proposed study will address this gap through a series of qualitative and quantitative analyses of posts from various forms of CMC used by members of both the far-right and Islamic extremist movements. The study draws more upon right-wing forums than upon the corners of the web inhabited by Islamist extremists. We will collect posts made in four active forums used by members of the far-right and three from the Islamic Extremist community, as well as posts made in Facebook, LiveJournal, Twitter, YouTube, and Pastebin accounts used by members of each movement,  the grant said. The findings will be used to document both the prevalence and variation in the ideological content of posts from members of each movement,  the grant continued.  In addition, we will assess the value of these messages in the social status of the individual posting the message and the function of radical messages in the larger on-line identity of participants in extremist communities generally. The project will also  identify the hidden networks of individuals who engage in extremist movements based on geographic location and ideological similarities. The results will be used for a public webinar, and for presentations for counterterrorism experts in the United States.Holder highlighted the study in remarks this February at the White House Summit on Countering Violent Extremism, as an example of the new methods the Justice Department is using to combat terrorist threats.Holder said the study will  help us develop more effective techniques and partnerships for counter-messaging. While the grant does not name the  far-right  groups that would be examined, other federal agencies have devoted their energy to the sovereign citizen movement.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) released a report on the movement, whose members believe that U.S. laws do not apply to them, just as the White House held its summit on violent extremism. The administration did not use the phrase  Islamist extremism  at the summit.DHS stirred controversy in 2009 when it issued a report on right-wing extremism, which included veterans returning from combat as a potential terrorist threat.The Justice Department and Michigan State University did not return requests for comment by press time.Via: Washington Free Beacon",politics,"Jun 1, 2015",3239
 YOU’RE FIRED: Trump Dumps Corey Lewandowski As Campaign Manager,"The Donald Trump campaign is in trouble, and it s showing. In a very surprising move, Trump has cut ties with his notoriously angry campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. Infamously, the campaign manager was once videotaped (and nearly charged) for assaulting a reporter at one of Trump s notoriously violent rallies. Now, he s out the door, and no one is quite sure why. The Trump campaign released the following cryptic statement regarding Lewandowski s exit: The Donald J. Trump Campaign for President, which has set a historic record in the Republican Primary having received almost 14 million votes, has today announced that Corey Lewandowski will no longer be working with the campaign. The campaign is grateful to Corey for his hard work and dedication and we wish him the best in the future. This move comes amid the fact that Trump s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton has pumped more than $20 million into advertising in key general election battleground states, while Trump has not started advertising at all. Further, there is a renewed and growing effort among the #DumpTrump faction of GOP delegates who do not want Trump as their presidential nominee. The newly formed group, dubbed  Free the Delegates,  is aimed toward unbinding delegates who are bound to Trump and allowing them to vote their conscience instead.The thing is, the way Trump shook up the primary season with his outrageous remarks that fired up the ignorant, bigoted unwashed masses in the GOP s insane base simply isn t working in the general election. Lewandowski was definitely an issue, with his hot temper. That, along with Trump s own uncontrollable mouth simply could not continue.I suppose their recognizing these facts is good for the GOP and the Trump campaign, but it is likely too late. The general electorate has seen what Trump is selling, and nobody is buying it. He s a racist, sexist, xenophobic buffoon, and America does not want him as our next Commander-in-Chief. Hopefully, this signals a death knell for Trump s nutty campaign, and we can focus on moving the nation forward when we elect Hillary Clinton in November.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"June 20, 2016",2160

 Top SCOTUS Insider Knows The ‘Most Likely’ Choice To Replace Scalia,"Conservatives are busy mourning the death of Antonin Scalia, and coming up with ways to make sure that no one President Obama picks will make it through to the court. Well, if they are angry and scheming right now, this next prediction will have the right positively fuming.According to NBC News, Tom Goldstein, the Supreme Court expert who is the mastermind behind SCOTUSblog, is predicting that President Obama will nominate current Attorney General Loretta Lynch to replace the recently deceased Scalia. Calling Lynch a  very serious possibility,  Goldstein went on to say: The fact that Lynch was vetted so recently for attorney general also makes it practical for the president to nominate her in relatively short order. Goldstein s predictions are in sharp contrast to those of Robert Reich, who believes that the pick would be Judge Sri Srinivasan, who has been nominated to a lower Court of Appeals by President Obama. However, it seems that Goldstein s prediction makes much more sense, both practically and politically.This nomination could be a political windfall for the left, and a disaster for the right. With so many Republicans vowing to refuse to allow any of Obama s nominees onto the court, their image problem when it comes to race will not be helped if they refuse to confirm Lynch. After all, she would be the first black woman to make it to the Supreme Court, and they would look like a bunch of racists and misogynists. Further, according to Goldstein, Lynch s history as a career prosecutor makes it very difficult to paint her as excessively liberal. Essentially, a Loretta Lynch nomination does everything the left needs it to do, and completely paints the GOP obstructionists into a corner. They already have serious problems with racial minorities, and with the way they treated the Loretta Lynch confirmation for the position of Attorney General, they can t afford to treat her badly again. People already called that racism and misogyny out for what it was, and if they want to maintain any kind of semblance of respect when it comes to race issues and minority communities, they will not block Lynch a second time. Goldstein s points on the issues a Lynch nomination poses for the GOP were nothing short of perfect: I think the administration would relish the prospect of Republicans either refusing to give Lynch a vote or seeming to treat her unfairly in the confirmation process. Either eventuality would motivate both black and women voters. Oh, I surely hope that this is true. Talk about a great way for President Obama to stick it to the GOP on his way out.Featured image from White House Flickr",News,"February 15, 2016",2634
 American Airlines Throws Ivy League Economist Off Plane For Doing Math,"Ivy League economist Guido Menzio has reportedly been removed from an American Airlines flight and interrogated after being found in possession of algebra.Menzio had been seated next to a female passenger on the plane who became suspicious that her dark-skinned fellow traveler was writing in a script with which she was unfamiliar. The female passenger then reported Menzio immediately and secretly to cabin crew as a suspected terrorist. She left the plane, citing illness as her excuse. Meanwhile, other passengers began to grumble at the delay. A short while later, Menzio was also escorted from the plane on grounds he would only be made aware of later.When security began to interrogate him about the woman who had left   so far as Menzio knew   due to illness, he believed he was playing a role in supporting their inquiries as to her condition. But they then revealed it was Menzio who was under suspicion and being interrogated as a suspect terrorist.As the Washington Post reports:Had the crew or security members perhaps quickly googled this good-natured, bespectacled passenger before waylaying everyone for several hours, they might have learned that he  Guido Menzio is a young but decorated Ivy League economist. And that he s best known for his relatively technical work on search theory, which helped earn him a professorship at the University of Pennsylvania and stints at Princeton and Stanford s Hoover Institution.They might even have discovered that last year he was awarded the Carlo Alberto Medal, given to the best Italian economist under 40. That s right: He s Italian, not Middle Eastern, or whatever heritage usually gets racially profiled on flights these days.The suspicious scrawl which so perturbed the female passenger and flight crew was nothing more than math. Algebra to be precise.The renowned economist said of his experience in a Facebook post:It s a bit funny. It s a bit worrisome. The lady just looked at me, looked at my writing of mysterious formulae, and concluded I was up to no good. Because of that an entire flight was delayed by 1.5 hours.Trump s America is already here. It s not yet in power though. Personally, I will fight back.Manzi becomes the latest among a litany of Muslim and non-Muslim people to have their lives interrupted and they character made suspect by the sort of casual racism and fear promoted by not only Donald Trump, but much of the mainstream media and conservative political class. After the horrors of McCarthy era America, we would hope the nation would have learned a valuable lesson on restraint.

Paul Craig Roberts: ‘By Cooperating with Washington on Syria & Russia Walked Into a Trap’," By Paul Crag RobertsA month ago I wrote a column ,  He Who Hesitates Is Lost And Russia Hesitated.  The consequences of this hesitation are now apparent:1. A UN report orchestrated by Washington has accused Syria and Russia of war crimes in Aleppo. According to the report,  indiscriminate airstrikes across the eastern part of the city by Government forces and their allies [Russia] are responsible for the overwhelming majority of civilian casualties. These violations constitute war crimes. And if knowingly committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against civilians, they constitute crimes against humanity. The UN Human Rights Council has now voted to start an  independent  investigation. The purpose of the investigation is to indict Russia and Putin as war criminals and to  bring to justice those responsible for the alleged abuses.  Moreover,  the situation should be urgently referred to the International Criminal Court. Every party to this conflict must know that they will be held accountable for the international crimes they commit   all, without selective protection or discrimination.  Keep in mind that Washington provides the largest share of the UN s budget, and the UN will overlook that it was Washington that sent ISIS to Aleppo.Obviously, neither Washington nor the UN will be able to drag Putin into the International Criminal Court, but a war criminal charge can serve Washington s purpose by stopping Putin from traveling abroad and curtailing his diplomatic efforts. The purpose of this orchestrated exercise is its propaganda value. Among Washington s many concerns is that some Eastern European countries, alarmed by the conflict that Washington is leading them into with Russia, will threaten NATO with a non-participation statement. If Russia is branded a war criminal, it becomes even more difficult for countries that foolishly and thoughtlessly joined NATO to extricate themselves from the consequences.2. Washington has succeeded in bringing to power in Poland the far right-wing Law and Justice Party. These agents of Washington have re-opened the matter of the death of Poland s President Kaczynski in a plane crash, making wild claims that the crash was a terror attack by Russia aimed at depriving Poland of its political leadership. Despite massive and convincing evidence to the contrary, the Law and Justice Party s claims will find traction thanks to the scary portrait of Russia painted by Washington s demonization campaign. The intended result is to further blacken and isolate Russia and its government.3. As the anointed spokesperson for the neoconservative warmongers, Hillary wants Washington to enforce a no-fly zone in Syria. A no-fly zone would require Washington to attempt to prevent Syrian and Russian air strikes against ISIS positions. It seems clear enough that Syria and Russia would not accept any attempt to deny Syria the use of the country s own airspace in the conflict against forces sent by Washington to overthrow the Syrian government, as happened to Gaddafi in Libya. Unless Russia and Syria surrender, Hillary s no-fly zone would result in military conflict between Russia and the US.To advance the no-fly zone proposal, the  use of chemical weapons  ruse has been resurrected. Fabricated reports are appearing that the Syrian air force is guilty of dropping chemical weapons on the Syrian population. On October 22, the Indian Express reported that on October 21 the UN-Led Joint Investigative Mechanism informed the UN Security Council that the chemical attack on Qmenas  was caused by a Syrian Arab Armed Forces helicopter dropping a device from a high altitude which hit the ground and released the toxic substance that affected the population.  The report concluded that three of the chemical attacks investigated were made by Syria and one by the Islamic State.The fact that the Russians resolved the chemical weapons issue in 2014, a year before the alleged attack on Qmenas, by taking possession of the weapons and removing them from Syria means that the report has little credibility. However, at no time during Washington s 15-year-old attack on Muslim countries have facts played any role, and certainly facts have played no role in Washington s demonization of Russia.4. Diana Johnstone has concluded that Hillary intends regime change for Russia and will use the presidency for that purpose.It is impossible to imagine a purpose more reckless and irresponsible. Many members of the Russian government have stated that Washington s provocation and demonization of Russia have brought trust between the nuclear powers close to zero and that Russia will never again fight a war on her own territory Continue this article at The Institute for Political EconomyREAD MORE RUSSIA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Russia Files",US_News,"October 26, 2016",4822
 Congressional Republicans Might Cause This Deadly Virus To Overwhelm U.S.,"There has been a minor war brewing in Congress since February that the media has not received as much attention as it needs to. Many Republicans are refusing to support President Obama s plan to prevent millions of deaths from the Zika virus, an epidemic that has swept through South America and could enter into the continental United states any day now.In February 2016, The World Health Organization officially declared the Zika virus a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. That s when President Obama announced a plan to spend $1.9 billion dollars to halt the spread of the virus before it reaches the United States and the rest of North America.Below is a map released by the White House that shows how the virus can spread throughout the United States.The Zika virus is spread through mosquito bites. Specifically, Aedes mosquitos. which are often found in urban areas, are to blame for the spread of the virus. When a person contracts the Zika virus, the symptoms are usually fairly mild. Those who are infected experience pain in their joints, headaches, and pain behind the eyes. Symptoms usually persist for a few weeks and then go away. Usually, a person who becomes infected with the virus becomes immune to the disease in the future. There is no cure for the disease. Historically, there have not been any incidents of the Zika virus being a fatal. However, since the outbreak, deaths have been linked to the virus   one of which was in Puerto Rico.Even though symptoms are mild for the average person, everything changes if a pregnant woman contracts the virus. That s where the disease reveals its true power to destroy lives. The Zika virus can cause a fetus to develop what is called fetal development disruption sequence. What happens is that the brain of the fetus stops growing, or is severely scared, which leads to brain damage and conditions such as microcephaly. A condition where an infant s head is much smaller than it should be, sometimes  as small as an orange  according to NPR.As it was pointed out in an opinion piece published in the New York Times, the fact that Republicans are willing are not willing to take immediate action to stop the virus is incredibly hypocritical when you consider they tried to blame the 2014 Ebola outbreak on the president.It should be noted that not all Republicans are willing to risk the nation s health over petty budget squabbles. Senator Marco Rubio has publicly lambasted his fellow Republicans for stalling.  Rubio was quoted as saying,  The money is going to be spent. And the question is, do we do it now before this has become a crisis, or do we wait for it to become a crisis?  Rubio has good reasons to plead for urgency on the matter. Gulf states will be among the first and hardest hit by the Zika when and if it reaches the continental United States, including Rubio s home state of Florida. If only, Rubio had the same mentality when it came to other crises such as climate change.So once again, we find ourselves with a Congress controlled by neoconservatives who have neither the compassion to do what is right and act to save lives, as well as the lack of fiscal wisdom to understand that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. These types of battles are what are what legitimizes Brand New Congress s mission to scout out and support Democrats and progressive Republicans (Yes, they do exist. It s pragmatic to accept that there are seats Dems are never going to be able to take.) in elections to make a Congress that functions. Or at least one that functions well enough that they can decide that the future of the United States shouldn t look like an episode of The Walking Dead.Featured image from (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)",News,"May 12, 2016",3742
 WATCH: Paul Ryan Basically Admits Republicans Will Kill Birth Control Coverage For Women,"Republicans are frothing at the mouth with excitement that Donald Trump could be the rubber stamp president they have been looking for.Paul Ryan has wanted to repeal Obamacare ever since it became law, not because it s a bad law as he and others in the GOP have claimed, but because it s the signature achievement of America s first black president. And they intend to do so no matter how many millions of Americans are harmed.One particular group of women who would be harmed is women.Women benefit from Obamacare because the law prevents insurance companies from labeling them as a pre-existing condition just for being a woman. Women can also keep their children on their insurance plan until they reach the age of 26 and get easier access to birth control, which insurance companies are required to cover.One would think Republicans would be all for this last benefit, especially since better access to contraception prevents unwanted pregnancies, therefore reducing the abortion rate.But during an interview with CNN s Jake Tapper, the current Speaker of the House literally refused to confirm whether or not the birth control mandate in Obamacare is safe. I m not going to get into all the little nitty-gritty details of these things,  Ryan said, which drew a sharp rebuke from Tapper. With all due respect,  Tapper began.  I don t know that the average woman of childbearing years out there who relies upon contraception provided by health insurance mandated by the Affordable Care Act, I don t know that she would think that that s just a nitty-gritty detail. Ryan responded by whining. You re asking me details about legislation that hasn t been written yet!  Ryan complained.  I m not going to get into hypotheticals about legislation that hasn t even been drafted. Here s the video via YouTube:In other words, Paul Ryan basically just admitted that Republicans will kill the Obamacare birth control mandate. He s just too much of a coward to say so because he knows women will be pissed off.Women should be able to have just as much access to birth control as men do. Men should not be allowed to legislate what women are allowed to do with their bodies, and that includes the decision to use contraception. But as usual, Republicans intend to wage war on women unlike anything we ve ever seen before.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"November 13, 2016",2338
 Anthony Anderson Burns Stacey Dash: She’s ‘Ann Coulter Dipped In Butterscotch’,"In an amazing take down of Fox News contributor Stacey Dash, comedian Anthony Anderson compared her to Ann Coulter.Dash has received heavy criticism ever since she called for ending BET and the NCAA Image Awards in her backwards solution to ending racism in response to the condemnation of the Oscars for the lack of diversity. We have to make up our minds,  Dash said on Fox News. Either we want to have segregation or integration. If we don t want segregation, then we need to get rid of channels like BET and the BET Awards and the Image Awards, where you re only awarded if you re black. If it were the other way around, we would be up in arms. It s a double standard. There shouldn t be a Black History Month,  the Clueless actress continued.  We re Americans. Period. Well, the backlash was swift and merciless as BET and others responded by reminding Dash that she has made several appearances on television shows and music videos aired on the channel.But Anthony Anderson also chimed in on Friday while hosting the 47th Annual NAACP Image Awards and it s fair to say that Dash got totally roasted by the Black-ish star. Everybody give a round of applause for Stacey Dash!  he began. What the hell is she doing here? Doesn t she know that the Fox network is using her? She s just an Ann Coulter dipped in butterscotch. That s all she is. Baby, don t let them use you! Come back to the black people and get back to work on some of those beautiful C-movies that you used to do! Anderson must have hit a nerve, because Dash responded with a weird post on Twitter.Well it s funny how woman who weighs 105 wet! Can get grown ass men to act like llittle girls! Haha  Stacey Dash (@REALStaceyDash) February 6, 2016Stacey Dash deserves the criticism she has been getting lately and Anthony Anderson made a spectacular comparison.The fact is that without BET or the NAACP, African-Americans would be even more underrepresented in the entertainment industry than they are now. Perhaps one day, there won t be a need for the Image Awards or BET. But that s going to depend on whether or not mainstream awards show like the Oscars get their act together and start treating black actors and actresses with the respect they deserve.

" As ‘Me Too’ Posts Flood Social Media, Video Surfaces Of Trump Bragging About Hiring A ‘HOT’ Teenager","Everyone knows what a dirtbag Donald Trump is when it comes to women. His wives, his ex-wives, his mistresses, and even perfect strangers could literally all be participating in the #MeToo posts going on right now on Facebook and Twitter.The movement really took off after a tweet by actress Alyssa Milano:If you ve been sexually harassed or assaulted write  me too  as a reply to this tweet. pic.twitter.com/k2oeCiUf9n  Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) October 15, 2017Sophie Gilbert wrote an excellent piece in The Atlantic about the use of the tag to draw attention to the fact that not some, not many, but most women have had to endure some sort of sexual harassment in their everyday lives, and most of them many, many times.But in the middle of it all, another tweet came across the feeds of at least Scott Dworkin s quarter of a million followers on Twitter Monday morning. It s a recently uncovered video of Donald Trump back in 2007 giving a highly-paid speech to the Learning Annex. In it, a woman named Juliet in the audience at one point raises her hand during the Q&A portion of the event, and asks Trump, How many jets do you have and how might I apply to be a flight attendant? Seizing the opportunity to be the jackass he s been his whole life, skeevy Donald has the lovely young woman escorted to the stage. As she approaches, his face contorts into  appreciative  looks and he tells the audience,  I think she s hired, I don t know.  Leering at her body, he puts his arm around her and says, deadpan, You re hired. Trump then proceeds to tell the audience a story. I had a case, it was very interesting. A beautiful girl who was 17 or 18 and applied to be a waitress. So beautiful. She s like a world-class beauty like the young lady who just asked a question about the actress. She s so beautiful. And my people came and she said,  Mr. Trump, she has no experience.  So I interviewed her anyway because she was so pretty. And I said,  Let me ask you, do you have any experience?  She goes,  No, sir.  I say,  When can you start?' Before Juliet can leave the stage, presumably having been brought on purely as a prop for his anecdote, he squeezes her and kisses her. Then he stares at her body as she leaves the stage. This isn t my  interpretation  of what Trump is doing, you ll see in the video yourself. And as if making faces, raising his eyebrows, pursing his lips as he watches her walk away isn t enough, he turns back to the microphone and explains his  addiction  to women: See now, if she worked on my plane, that s like a death wish for me, right? That s like an alcoholic. People are alcoholics. You put Scotch in front of them, it s like [Trump waves his hands around the way he did while making fun of a disabled reporter], it s like, this would be my form of alcoholism. It is so sad that the biggest trend on social media right now is people sharing their stories of abuse publicly, just to spread awareness about how pervasive the problem is  And the country is being led by one of the biggest, most public perpetrators of that kind of abuse the world has ever known.Watch the video here:Featured image via Leon Neal/Getty Images",News,"October 16, 2017",3163
BOMBSHELL: President Carter Banned Iranians From America During Hostage Crisis,"Thanks to Daniel Greenfield for digging up this bombshell of a fact: Carter did what Trump just announced he d like to do. This reminds us all (I hope) that we ve been doing this Muslim terrorism thing for waaay too long! It s been decades of dealing with this barbaric behavior and hate. If you ve never seen  ARGO , please make time to watch it! It s a really great flashback of terrorism in the 70 s but we re STILL dealing with this evil remember Benghazi? Here s a trailer from the movie about the hostage crisis in 1979 under President Jimmy Carter: So who s the Hitler now? The name calling has been so over the top against Trump that it s almost embarrassing. The RINO Republicans (Lindsey Graham) and liberal press (Shepard Smith) were absolutely ridiculous! Take the emotion out of this and look at the facts!During the Iranian hostage crisis, Carter issued a number of orders to put pressure on Iran. Among these, Iranians were banned from entering the United States unless they oppose the Shiite Islamist regime or had a medical emergency.Here s Jimmy  Hitler  Carter saying it back in 1980.Fourth, the Secretary of Treasury [State] and the Attorney General will invalidate all visas issued to Iranian citizens for future entry into the United States, effective today. We will not reissue visas, nor will we issue new visas, except for compelling and proven humanitarian reasons or where the national interest of our own country requires. This directive will be interpreted very strictly.Apparently barring people from a terrorist country is not against  our values  after all. It may even be  who we are . Either that or Carter was a racist monster just like Trump.Meanwhile here s how the Iranian students in the US were treated.Carter orders 50,000 Iranian students in US to report to immigration office with view to deporting those in violation of their visas. On 27 December 1979, US appeals court allows deportation of Iranian students found in violation.In November 1979, the Attorney General had given all Iranian students one month to report to the local immigration office. Around 7,000 were found in violation of their visas. Around 15,000 Iranians were forced to leave the US.Meanwhile any Iranians entering the US were forced to undergo secondary screening.Interestingly enough, Carter did this by invoking the Nationality Act of 1952. A law originally opposed by Democrats for its attempt to restrict Communist immigration to the United States. If this oasis of the world should be overrun, perverted, contaminated, or destroyed, then the last flickering light of humanity will be extinguished,  Senator McCarran said of the law. He was a Democrat.Now unlike Muslims, Iranians were not necessarily supportive of Islamic terrorism. Many were and are opponents of it. Khomeini didn t represent Iran as a country, but his Islamist allies. So Trump s proposal is far more legitimate than Carter s action. Carter targeted people by nationality. Trump s proposal does so by ideology.Read more: FRONTPAGE MAGAZINE",left-news,"Dec 8, 2015",3032

The FBI on Monday released a partial transcript of the phone conversations the Orlando gunman had with law enforcement during the three hours he was holed up inside a gay nightclub with hostages   but the decision to redact portions of the calls, including references made to Islamist terror groups, drew swift criticism.A call summary and partial transcript shows that gunman Omar Mateen first called 911 about 30 minutes after he opened fire and stormed Pulse nightclub, telling an emergency call taker that he was the shooter and making claims of allegiance that investigators are still vetting.  Praise be to God, and prayers as well as peace be upon the prophet of God [in Arabic],  Mateen said according to the transcript.  I let you know, I m in Orlando, and I did the shootings.  He also falsely told law enforcement that cars outside the nightclub had explosives in them and that he was wearing a vest like the kind they  used in France,  making reference to explosive vests used in the Paris terror attacks. FBI Director James Comey has previously said that Mateen pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State, as well as to various Islamist terror groups. However the names of those groups and individuals were edited out of the transcripts released Monday.Law enforcement defended the selective editing, saying that they wanted to avoid re-victimizing those who lived through the attack or encouraging others to carryout similar attacks.The editing is  meant to not give credence to individuals who have done terrorist acts in the past,  said FBI Special Agent in Charge Ron Hopper.  We are not going to propagate their violent rhetoric.  But the decision not to release full transcripts of Mateen s 911 call or three crisis negotiator calls almost immediately drew criticism. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan said the decision to edit out references to the Islamic State terrorist group was  preposterous.   We know the shooter was a radical Islamist extremist inspired by ISIS. We also know he intentionally targeted the LGBT community. The administration should release the full, unredacted transcript so the public is clear-eyed about who did this, and why,  the Wisconsin Republican said in a statement. Agent Hopper said Monday that investigators still have no indication that Mateen, who identified himself as an  Islamic solider,  was directed to carry out the attacks by any foreign terrorist group organization. Rather the gunman was radicalized domestically, he said.Read more: Washington Times",politics,"Jun 20, 2016",3053

 Lawsuit Filed Against Intelligence Agencies For Records On Russian Election Tampering,"The CIA, the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence are being sued for records containing information regarding Russia s tampering with the U.S. presidential election.On Monday, Journalist Jason Leopold and Ryan Shapiro, a Ph.D. candidate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The suit alleges that the intelligence agencies failed to comply with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) by refusing to turn over requested documents.According to The Hill:On Dec. 14, Leopold and Shapiro asked the intelligence agencies for copies of communications to or from the Electoral College and any records that mention or refer to a requests Electoral College members made for information and briefings on the investigations into ties between Trump, his campaign or his associates. The request included mentions of Russian government interference in the election.Earlier this month, the CIA revealed that their assessment of Russia s election meddling had found that not only had they interfered with the U.S. presidential election, but they had done so with the express purpose of helping Donald Trump win. The FBI later announced that they agreed with the CIA s findings.In the suit, Leopold and Shapiro are asking the court to compel the intelligence agencies to turn over the pertinent records as mandated by the FOIA. This is not Leopold s first rodeo when it comes to these kinds of cases. Most notably, he was part of the lawsuit that got the State Department to release Hillary Clinton s emails.Trump has dismissed the idea that Russia meddled with the election as  ridiculous  and has claimed that Democrats are just making it up as an excuse for his  massive  win. (Quick reminder, he lost the popular vote by almost 3 million votes and even his electoral college win isn t all that freaking massive in reality.)Numerous lawmakers, from both the left and right, are calling for an official investigation into Russia s unprecedented interference in our election.Featured image via David Burnett/Newsmakers/Getty Images",News,"December 27, 2016",2160
CLINT EASTWOOD Gets Real With The “P*ssy Generation” And Political Correctness…Guess Who He’s Supporting For Prez?,"Scott and Clint Eastwood are a great father/son duo in their latest interview with Esquire magazine. The banter between the two is so good that you just know they have a close relationship. They look so much alike it s pretty amazing.The best parts of the interview are Clint s honest assessment of the  p*ssy generation In true Eastwood style, he calls out all of the people who re calling everything under the sun  racist . You ve gotta love his common sense attitude when he tells those offended liberals to  just get over it . He s a Trump guy and totally understands where Trump is coming. You ll love his assessment of Hillary it s dead on!In an interview with Esquire published Wednesday, the actor/director/producer said young America   which he has dubbed both the  kiss-ass  and  pussy  generation   needs to stop throwing the word  racist  around so freely. Trump s onto something, because secretly everybody s getting tired of political correctness, kissing up,  he said.  We re really in a pussy generation. Everybody s walking on eggshells. We see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff. When I grew up, those things weren t called racist. Eastwood also said that he isn t inclined to support Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton if she continues upholding the status quo. I d have to go for Trump   you know,  cause she s declared that she s gonna follow in Obama s footsteps,  he said.  There s been just too much funny business on both sides of the aisle. She s made a lot of dough out of being a politician. I gave up dough to be a politician. Though Eastwood said he hasn t formally endorsed anybody, he dismissed the furor caused by Trump s comments about the Mexican heritage of Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who presided over federal lawsuits against Trump University. Yeah, it s a dumb thing to say. I mean, to predicate your opinion on the fact that the guy was born to Mexican parents or something. He s said a lot of dumb things. So have all of them. Both sides,  Eastwood said.  But everybody   the press and everybody s going,  Oh, well, that s racist,  and they re making a big hoodoo out of it. Just f ing get over it. It s a sad time in history.

 Dem Challenger To Paul Ryan Has Raised A Massive Amount Of Money In The Last 24 hours,"Randy Bryce, known as @IronStache on Twitter, launched a campaign to oust Paul Ryan from Wisconsin s 1st District. Bryce is a union ironworker who has been campaigning for all of one day, and he s already raised $100,000. That is a lot for a new face who s a Democrat living in Republican-land and running in a district that s gone to Paul Ryan every two years since 1999.Bryce isn t just a union ironworker in Republican-land, Wisconsin, though. He s an Army veteran who enlisted right after high school, and then worked his way up to being an ironworker through apprenticeship. His mother suffers from multiple sclerosis, his father is in an assisted living facility, and Randy himself is a cancer survivor. He s campaigning primarily on healthcare right now, and he says on his website: What Paul Ryan and the Republicans are doing to take health care away from millions of us, to make it cost more and cover less, and to allow the protections we ve gained to be stripped away   it s just unacceptable. Bryce has an uphill battle to fight. Ryan is very well-connected both in the 1st District and across America. However, Bryce will work to tie Ryan to Donald Trump as much as possible, working off Democrats  hopes that the Trump effect will help flip Congress next year.But it may not be that terrible a climg. Paul Ryan is already wildly unpopular around the country, with an approval rating below 30 percent. That could very well pull down his popularity in his own district. He s also starting to get a reputation for making every excuse in the book for Trump. Regarding obstruction of justice, Ryan lamely claimed that Trump is new and doesn t know what s appropriate and what s not when it comes to interacting with various agency heads, particularly those in the law enforcement and intelligence communities. Ryan gave him a pass as though he s a little child navigating his way through the world for the first time.He s also confident that Trump will approve of the massively unpopular GOP healthcare bill whatever form that ends up taking and once again blasted the ACA while claiming that their bill is ever so much better.Ryan is almost inextricably linked to Trump right now, and as Trump s base shrinks, so will Ryan s. What Bryce is doing and clearly, what many are hoping he can do is taking advantage of the possibility that a hole will open up in the 1st District because of Trump.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"June 21, 2017",2445
"NOT SO FUNNY GUY, Liberal WILL FERRELL Makes Movie Mocking Ronald Reagan’s Alzheimer’s…Reagan’s Daughter Has A Few Choice Words For Him","What s next Making a comedy at the Humane Society about euthanizing pets?  Patti Davis, daughter of late President Ronald Reagan and Nancy Reagan, penned a moving open letter to actor Will Ferrell on Thursday criticizing his involvement in an upcoming comedic film that will satirize President Reagan s tragic battle with Alzheimer s disease.The film, based on a 2015 Black List script, centers on a fictional story in which President Reagan begins suffering from dementia shortly after a landslide reelection victory in 1984. A young aide must convince Reagan that he is an actor playing the President in a movie.Ferrell is attached to play Reagan in the film and will produce it under his Gary Sanchez Productions banner.Here is the letter Patty Davis penned to Ferrell:Dear Mr. Ferrell,I saw the news bulletin   as did everyone   that you intend to portray my father in the throes of Alzheimer s for a comedy that you are also producing. Perhaps you have managed to retain some ignorance about Alzheimer s and other versions of dementia. Perhaps if you knew more, you would not find the subject humorous.Alzheimer s doesn t care if you are President of the United States or a dockworker. It steals what is most precious to a human being   memories, connections, the familiar landmarks of a lifetime that we all come to rely on to hold our place secure in this world and keep us linked to those we have come to know and love. I watched as fear invaded my father s eyes   this man who was never afraid of anything. I heard his voice tremble as he stood in the living room and said,  I don t know where I am.  I watched helplessly as he reached for memories, for words, that were suddenly out of reach and moving farther away. For ten long years he drifted   past the memories that marked his life, past all that was familiar and mercifully, finally past the fear.There was laughter in those years, but there was never humor.Alzheimer s is the ultimate pirate, pillaging a person s life and leaving an empty landscape behind. It sweeps up entire families, forcing everyone to claw their way through overwhelming grief, confusion, helplessness, and anger. Perhaps for your comedy you would like to visit some dementia facilities. I have   I didn t find anything comedic there, and my hope would be that if you re a decent human being, you wouldn t either.Twice a week I run a support group called Beyond Alzheimer s for caregivers and family members of those with Alzheimer s and dementia. I look into haunted eyes that remind me of my own when my father was ill. I listen to stories of helplessness and loss and am continually moved by the bravery of those who wake up every morning not knowing who their loved one will be that day, or what will be lost. The only certainty with Alzheimer s is that more will be lost and the disease will always win in the end.Perhaps you would like to explain to them how this disease is suitable material for a comedy.",politics,"Apr 28, 2016",2953
THE GUY WHO Punched “Moldylocks” Speaks Out About Violent Antifa Female With A Bottle [VIDEO],"Nathan Domingo is the founder of  Identity Europa  and is the guy who was seen by millions of viewers punching a female Antifa thug the media tried to portray as a helpless woman that just happened to be in the area when fighting broke out at a free speech rally in Berkeley, CA on April 16th.The last time these two group clashed, the Trump supporters were seriously outnumbered. This time was a different story. Trump supporters came prepared for the unprovoked attacks of these hate groups and took them to task. With all the violence that happened yesterday, leftist media outlets seemed to be obsessed with reporting on the video that was taken of an alleged Trump supporter who punched an antifa female who was part of the violent group  Oak Roots Collective  that traveled to Berkeley to confront Trump supporters and shut down their right to free speech.Here s the video. At the 18 second mark you can see the woman cock her arm back as though she is about to swing her arm at someone. When she brings her arm forward, that is where she gets hit. We are NOT condoning the hitting of a woman by a man, but if she had a bottle in her hand and was about to hit someone that changes everything:CBS San Fransisco Bay Area news interviewed anarchist Louise Rosealma, who along with her boyfriend is a member of the Oak Roots Collective. Here s a sample of the violence they promote on their Facebook page. This is how these people (that should be labeled as domestic terrorists) see themselves. These anarchists live in a world where it s okay to act with violence against law enforcement and innocent people who don t agree with their political views:Here s citizen journalist Tim Pool talking to the Antifa female who was hit. When he asks her if she thinks it s okay that Antifa rioters threw M-80 s at people on the Trump side, her response was,  Well, the revolution isn t f*cking easy!

"HILLARY SHARES PRO-ILLEGAL MANIFESTO: Plans To Open Borders, Create Taxpayer Funded Agency To Give ILLEGALS Amnesty","To hell with the common sense voter, Hillary believes she only needs Americans who are okay with living in a lawless nation to lock down the Presidency. It seems to have worked pretty well for her predecessor why not?Hillary Clinton wrote an op/ed piece for the Arizona Republic and boy is it insane. It s sort of an anti-Trump/pro-illegal alien manifesto that lays out her immigration policy if she becomes president. Two noteworthy things are that she intends to open our borders completely and establish a government agency that will spend taxpayer money to help illegal aliens become citizens.Hillary starts out with a folksy story about an illegal alien who would be deported if Donald Trump was in charge and then lashed out at the Supreme Court for ruling against Obama s amnesty executive order, calling it,  heartbreaking and unacceptable. And while our system fails to provide certainty to immigrant families, political figures like Donald Trump turn them into scapegoats for many of the challenges facing American families today. His bigotry and fear-mongering may be an attempt to divide our country and distract from his lack of real solutions to raise incomes and create good paying jobs   but it s not going to work.Let s be clear: When Trump talks about forming a  deportation force  to round up and expel 11 million immigrants   he s talking about ripping apart families Isn t that cute? Hillary wants you to think there is no difference between legal immigrants and illegal aliens. Trump has never once said he plans to round up and deport legal immigrants, just that he wants to enforce existing immigration laws.When he praises local figures like Gov. Jan Brewer and Sheriff Joe Arpaio, he s endorsing their heartless and divisive policies.How is enforcing the law a  heartless policy  as Hillary says? The only way our immigration laws are divisive is because illegal aliens don t like them.Instead of building walls, we ought to be breaking down barriers. Our country has always been stronger when we lift each other up, not tear each other down. We re stronger together.Here Hillary is obviously saying that she wants open borders, which essentially would nullify our status as an autonomous country, but there s even more garbage contained within that last statement. Illegal aliens are not Americans and therefore not part of  us.  They are citizens of another country, which makes them  not us.  They don t stand with us, they don t lift us up, and they sure as shit don t make us stronger.After proving that Hillary plans to be the leader of the third world rather than the President of the United States, she outlined ways she will make that happen.First up, amnesty beyond Obama s bullshit:That s why, as president, I ll fight for comprehensive immigration reform that includes a path to full and equal citizenship, starting in my first 100 days in office. We should do everything we can to keep families together, better integrate immigrants into their communities, and help those eligible for naturalization take the last step to citizenship.Then another bloated bureaucracy and massive waste of funds:Second, we need to increase our focus on integration and make sure that immigrants are able to thrive in American society. Let s provide more federal resources to help immigrants learn the English language skills they need to be successful. And because this issue cuts across all levels of government   local, state and federal   I ll create the first-ever Office of Immigrant Affairs at the White House to help coordinate these policies across the nation.And finally, some more government handouts designed to make instant democrats:Third, let s help the 9 million people in our country who are currently eligible for naturalization become full citizens. They work and pay taxes   yet they cannot vote or serve on juries. Let s expand fee waivers so that those seeking naturalization can get a break on the costs. And let s step up our outreach and education, because no one should miss out on the chance to be a citizen.Hillary claims that her plans will strengthen our economy by flooding the country with unskilled uneducated people who will drive down wages. I m not sure how that works and Hillary certainly didn t try to explain it.No matter what Donald Trump says, we have always been a nation of immigrants And it is long past time we helped millions of hard-working people step out of the shadows and onto a path to a brighter future.When has Trump ever denied that America was formed by immigrants? All he wants is the fairness that comes with upholding the law.If Hillary Clinton becomes president, we can pretty much kiss our country goodbye. With no border security and zero immigration enforcement, America as we know it will cease to exist.  Downtrend",politics,"Jun 25, 2016",4800
GITMO PRISONER OBAMA RELEASED IN 2012 Identified As Al-Qaeda Leader In Yemen,"Another Gitmo detainee returns to terror Is anyone else starting to see a pattern here? Former Guantanamo detainee, Ibrahim Qosi, who is also known as Sheikh Khubayb al Sudani, is now an al-Qaeda leader in Yemen.April , 2012  For al-Qosi, his release will allow him to be reunited with his family. Unlike many other prisoners, all of his immediate family are still alive. As Paul Reichler, his Washington-based civilian attorney, who represented him pro bono for seven years, explained,  He is now in his 50s, eager only to spend his life at home with his family in Sudan   his mother and father, his wife and two teenage daughters, and his brothers and their families   and live among them in peace, quiet and freedom. His Pentagon-appointed defense lawyer, Navy Cmdr. Suzanne Lachelier, noted that, last week, al-Qosi was moved to  special quarters,  with  a flat-screen TV, a refrigerator that let him eat at his leisure and a small outdoor gravel-topped patio, all inside a locked enclosure.  Cmdr. Lachelier added there was also  a real bed rather than a steel bunk topped with a mat,  but that al-Qosi slept on the floor before leaving  because he suffers from a bad back. A source with knowledge of al-Qosi s case, who does not wish to be identified, told me that the Obama administration was unwilling to detain al-Qosi after his sentence came to an end, and I believe that one of the reasons that the President negotiated a waiver to the provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act, allowing him to bypass restrictions on releasing prisoners that were imposed by Congress, was to prevent Republicans from trying to force him to continueholding al-Qosi.Summing up his client, al-Qosi s lawyer, Paul Reichler said,  He is an intelligent, pious, humble and sincere individual who has endured much hardship the past 10 years. But he returns home without hatred or rancor. Really? Al-Qaeda leader = peace? The Long War Journal reported:Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) released a new video featuring a former Guantanamo detainee, Ibrahim Qosi, who is also known as Sheikh Khubayb al Sudani.In July 2010, Qosi plead guilty to charges of conspiracy and material support for terrorism before a military commission. His plea was part of a deal in which he agreed to cooperate with prosecutors during his remaining time in US custody. Qosi was transferred to his home country of Sudan two years later, in July 2012.Qosi joined AQAP in 2014 and became one of its leaders. Qosi and other AQAP commanders discussed their time waging jihad at length in the video, entitled  Guardians of Sharia. Islamic scholars ensure the  correctness  of the  jihadist project,  according to Qosi. And the war against America continues through  individual jihad,  which al Qaeda encourages from abroad. Here, Qosi referred to al Qaeda s policy of encouraging attacks by individual adherents and smaller terror cells. Indeed, AQAP s video celebrates jihadists who have acted in accordance with this call, such as the Kouachi brothers, who struck Charlie Hebdo s offices in Paris earlier this year. The Kouachi brothers  operation was sponsored by AQAP. Via: Gateway Pundit ",politics,"Dec 10, 2015",3169
 Neo-Nazis Think They Know Exactly Who Is Responsible For Forcing Flynn Out; Predicts Others Will Fall Too,"After evidence surfaced that suggested Russia had blackmail-worthy dirt on Trump s national security adviser, General Michael Flynn, Flynn was forced to resign on Monday. Some Americans aren t convinced that that was the real reason, though. Some are blaming it on  the Jews. Neo-Nazi writers are upset that retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn has resigned from his position as national security adviser. The anti-Semites are lionizing Flynn as  one of our best guys  and a  true patriot  who has  been quite critical of the Jews in the past.  They are also lamenting that his resignation is  definitely a loss   to the Jews  and are speculating that he was pushed out by  more subversive elements in the White House. Source: Media MattersIt s not surprising that Flynn supporters would feel this way. After all, he s one of theirs.The disgraced former national security adviser has repeatedly pushed toxic views. Last July, Flynn shared a tweet that read in part,  Not anymore, Jews. Not Anymore.  (He later apologized.) He claimed on Twitter that  Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL.  Flynn also endorsed the work of racist author Mike Cernovich, who has frequently pushed white nationalist themes on his Twitter account (many of which he later deleted). Cernovich has claimed that  diversity is code for white genocide,   Blacks use guns for murder. Whites use guns to kill themselves,  and  Diversity is bad for national security. The Daily Stormer, which is just one of the Neo-Nazi sites that s gaining popularity since Trump s election, had this to say about Flynn s resignation:This is giving a victory to the kike media.I actually didn t think the block on the travel ban was a loss. I think that was all part of the plan to get the public stirred up against activist judges, to get ready for the Supreme Court to rule on an even more hardcore version of the Moslem ban.But this.This is definitely a loss.To the Jews.Infostormer, another such site, predicts that more are about to fall:We re going to be keeping a much closer eye on the White House factional struggles in the coming days and weeks, because if my senses are correct, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will likely be the next man attacked for his ties to Russia and Vladimir Putin.The lead-up to the demise of General Flynn was somewhat ignored by us due to the sheer level of nonsense that has been pushed forth by the Lugenpresse lately, but we won t make that mistake again.The Jews are not going to get away with another bullying attack on our regime   they will be called out, and they will be defeated if and when they try again.I can t believe I m about to say this, but I hope the Nazis are right about Tillerson. As for the rest, well, it s not their  regime.  The presidency belongs to the American people all of us, even those of us who are Jewish. If a member of the government is antisemitic or in bed with the Russian government, you d better damned well believe that we will do everything in our power to stop them.Featured image by Mario Tama via Getty Images",News,"February 14, 2017",3036
" Ann Coulter Gets EATEN ALIVE By GOP Strategist, And It’s WILDLY Entertaining (VIDEO)","There s something wildly entertaining about conservative infighting, especially when the person on the receiving end is Ann Coulter. She s not only racist, she s unapologetically racist, so clearly her choice for president is Republican frontrunner Donald Trump.As some say, the Republican Party may not be racist, but most racists are Republican. This was proved more so now than ever, and calling Coulter out on her anti-immigration/pro-Trump stance is GOP strategist Liz Mair.It all happened on MSNBC s Hardball where host Chris Matthews invited the two women on to discuss their viewpoints. After several minutes of meaningless banter, Coulter eventually settled on saying: It s all about immigration. It doesn t really matter what a Republican s position is on saving Social Security or how they re going to reform Medicare. Americans are being outvoted by foreigners, and Americans have been begging their own party to shut it down, to stop this endless immigration for decades now. As well as insisting that  Donald Trump is the first one to actually take America s side on immigration. That s why he is sweeping the polls. Mair jumped in and shut her down, saying: I think that that s a patently ludicrous notion. Most of the time, when we ve been looking at  amnesty fights,  they ve actually been shut down by a set of groups that are funded by population-control enthusiast liberal who is actually involved with zero-population growth and the Sierra Club. That s who s actually shut it down. It s not actually in any way advancing the economic interests of the American people. Free-market economists actually agree with that. Mair even goes so far as to call Trump a liberal. However, Trump is more of a  I m gonna say what makes me popular  kind of guy, and since his racism is working, he s run with it, or rather, on it. When Mair brought up that Coulter used to support Romney, Coulter bit back: My ideal ticket is Trump/Romney. That s what I m really hoping for. That s a dynamite combination. She s not wrong, that ticket certainly would be explosive for the United States, but not in a good way. Mair, however decided to continue tearing Coulter apart, saying: That is the proof right there that you are in no way conservative and no way interested in conservative policy. It s true. Coulter seems to only be concerned with being as racist as possible, and Trump fits the bill for that. Her love of Romney likely stems from the 47% remarks that were blatantly racist in his attack against President Obama and his supporters. And while conservative politics aren t always that blatantly racist, they aren t exactly inconspicuous either. Mair seems to believe that Trump supporters are just  liberals who just happen to hate Mexicans. Here s the thing   BOTH women are wrong about pretty much everything.So, while it was a pleasure to see Coulter get torn apart by a fellow conservative, Mair needs to realize that Coulter is pretty much the exact epitome of modern-day conservatism and conservative policy in the new GOP.

" WATCH: Conservatives Don’t Punch Nazis, They Give Them Credentials To Attend CPAC","If there is one political ideology that every American should despise, it s Nazism. But conservatives don t seem to mind it one bit.On inauguration day last month, Nazi Richard Spencer got punched in the face by a protester during an interview.Spencer, along with others of his ilk, support Donald Trump and hail his presidency as a new era of white nationalism where fascism and racism flourish.It s no secret, of course. Conservatives have been moving further to the extreme right for decades and the end of that side of the political spectrum is Nazism.Rather than run away from Nazism and people like Spencer who advocate in favor of it, conservatives decided to give Spencer credentials to attend their annual CPAC conference.Spencer attended on Thursday, and he had a lot to say to reporters as supporters flocked to him like moths to a flame.When asked how he feels about being at CPAC, Spencer said he  feels welcome.

They also threatened him with deportation, all the while invoking Donald Trump s hateful ideas. One worker says to the driver: Behave or you ll be deported. Another said: Where s Trump? Where s Trump when you need him? Luckily, the driver did the smart thing and instead of saying anything to these Trump-loving imbeciles, drove around them another way and left. These are the sorts of every day confrontations and bullying that are becoming all too common as a direct result of the rise of Donald Trump. The fact that these workers felt like it was okay to do this while working for the city of New York is quite ominous indeed. They are the perfect example of what Trump has done to America. Whether he gets the GOP nomination or not, whether he wins the election or not, he has done monumental damage to America s social climate, and here is your proof.Hopefully, these workers are identified and fired.Watch the video below, via NY Daily News:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"March 17, 2016",1386
(VIDEO) ICE DIRECTOR: AGENTS COULD BE FIRED IF THEY DON’T ENFORCE OBAMA’S LAWLESS IMMIGRATION POLICY,"It s simple and it s wrong: The Obama border policy asks ICE agents to disobey federal law. It would be nice if people we ve elected to Congress would stand up for the LEGAL citizens of America. It s literally been an invasion from Central America that is now on its second wave. Please pick up the phone and call your ELECTED Congressmen and tell them to do their job! It does make a difference!During a hearing on ICE oversight on April 14, Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) referred to Obama s statement during a town hall event in February, during which the President said there would be  consequences  for ICE agents who enforce federal immigration laws outside of his mandated enforcement priorities.Representative Franks then asked Saldana what those consequences would be. The president also said, and I know this question was proffered earlier, if somebody s working for ICE and they don t follow this policy, there s going to be consequences for it,  Franks explained.  Have you enforced that? I mean is there, are there consequences for not following that policy? There are consequences for not following the rule of the employee s status with the agency. I have a whole manual on that     Saldana said before being cut off. What would the consequences be if someone in the position that required them to follow through with the president s directives   and again we ll set the constitutional issue aside for the moment, if the president s done that then I guess we can do that   what would be the consequences for doing that?  Franks pressed. Well, whether it s that directive, or assaulting an employee in the office, or not abiding by some other rule or policy, the range of punishment can range from anything to a verbal meeting, where you counsel that person, to ultimately what s available to any employer and that s termination,  Saldana said.",left-news,"Apr 14, 2015",1855
SHERIFF WON’T ENFORCE GUN CONTROL LAW HE CALLS ‘BORDERLINE TREASONOUS’,"The gun grabbers are at it again pushing for more oversight and background checks for gun owners. The sheriff says it s  borderline treasonous  and will be a  nightmare  for law enforcement. He s refusing to enforce these efforts at gun control and we salute him for his stance! Bravo!While Oregon Democrats stood with Gabby Giffords and the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence to push expanded background checks on April 1, Grant County Sheriff Glenn Palmer stood for the law-abiding citizens whom the checks will target by describing the gun control push as  borderline treasonous. Palmer also made clear that if the Democrats pass the measure there is zero chance of his office enforcing it.The push for expanded background checks in Oregon is being spearheaded by state senator Floyd Prozanski (D-Eugene). His efforts are strongly supported by the Brady Campaign and Giffords.Giffords, in particular, believes every potential gun purchaser should have to pass the same background check her attacker passed to acquire his firearm, which the same background check Jerad and Amanda Miller (Las Vegas), Aaron Ybarra (Seattle Pacific University), Elliot Rodger (Santa Barbara), Ivan Lopez (Fort Hood 2014), Darion Marcus Aguilar (Maryland mall), Karl Halverson Pierson (Arapahoe High School), James Holmes (Aurora theater), Nidal Hasan (Fort Hood 2009), and many, many others passed to get the guns they used in their crimes.The irony is not lost on Sheriff Palmer, who sees the push for expanded background checks as just another way to infringe on the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens without impacting crime or criminals. For these reasons, Oregon Live said Palmer described the push as  borderline treasonous. Moreover, Palmer said the background checks pose a nightmare scenario for law enforcement officers who will be straddled with the responsibility of determining when a background should have been done but was not, as well as when a background check is not necessary to begin with.Palmer said he has  no intention  of enforcing Prozanski s bill if it becomes law.Via: Breitbart News",left-news,"Apr 6, 2015",2111

WATCH: BLACK SPORTS HOST BLASTS White ESPN Sports Host For Asking White Athletes To Take A Knee During National Anthem,"When will Americans stop being afraid of standing up to leftist agitators and tell them,  NO!  When will Americans find a backbone and stop allowing the left to dictate what they re allowed to say or to feel? Why are white Americans allowing themselves and law enforcement officers of every race and ethnicity to be thrown under the bus, because we re led by the radical left to believe that it will somehow make us better people.Oddly, sports channels have decided to assume the role of America s social conscience. Sports used to be a unifying force for Americans, a place for perfect strangers to come together and bond over their love and support for a particular team. The Disney owned ESPN sports network has been working very hard to change that.Fear and intimidation are two of the tools the Left uses in order to make people comply with their message of unity through division. And according to one TV and radio sports host, these tactics are beginning to take hold in the NFL.Fox Sports 1 host Jason Whitlock joined Tucker Carlson Monday evening on Fox News   Tucker Carlson Tonight  to talk about the state of protesting during the National Anthem in the NFL.Whitlock understands that protesting is perfectly within players  rights as Americans, but he takes issue with the method in which people like unemployed quarterback Colin Kaepernick go about protesting. There are NFL players, black and white, who know that if you really want to address police brutality, social justice, inequality in this country, protesting the National Anthem is the perfect way for your message to get completely lost,  Whitlock told Carlson.NFL players have so many platforms on which to voice their approval or displeasure on whatever issue they re championing this week. But to use the National Anthem as the vehicle for their message only causes their message fall flat in the eyes of a lot of football fans. These  silent protests  don t make them look heroic, but rather selfish.Whitlock also posed an interesting theory to Carlson concerning players who aren t participating in these social justice protests. I want to know why NFL players aren t offering voices of dissent?  Whitlock asked. You can t tell me that there aren t NFL players who recognize the stupidity of the style of protest Colin Kaepernick has chosen,  Whitlock said.  But they re all afraid to say it because of the backlash. Another good point.We have seen sports entities like the NFL and ESPN become bastions of social justice promotion in an age where people are being divided into more groups than the  Divergent  series.

 WATCH: Joy Reid Warns That Trump Is Going to Cause Terrorist Attacks Around The World,"By winning the presidency, Donald Trump just made the world more unsafe than ever before.Any anti-America groups who want to punish the United States and send a message to Trump can easily do so by targeting Trump s hotels and resorts around the globe.And they will be easy targets, too, because they all have Trump s name on them.Donald Trump is about to become the face of the United States. As horrifying as that is, Joy Reid explained during Meet The Press on Sunday that terrorists can now provoke Trump and challenge the United States by attacking buildings with his name on them. You start to have anything with a Trump name on it around the world becoming an instant terrorist target,  Reid said. How do we react to a world in which the name of the president of the United States is plastered all over hotels and hot spots? Indeed, this is yet another reason why Donald Trump should sell his company. Continuing to own it places thousands of people around the world at serious risk. Hotels have been a prime target of terrorists for years, and Trump becoming president gives terrorists a new target. If President Bush or President Obama had had hotels with their names on them in other nations you can bet terrorists would have targeted them as well. But they didn t. Trump, however, does. And Trump s thin-skin makes him an even better target because these terrorists want the United States to go bankrupt with never-ending wars. And if anyone will be quick to take America to war anywhere on Earth, it s Donald Trump.Trump s foreign entanglements also make him and our country vulnerable.Reid explained that Trump s foreign business ties could threaten our foreign policy because other nations could seek to re-write our policy by threatening Trump s businesses or calling in a debt. We cannot discount how his personal conflicts of interest wind up influencing his foreign policy,  Reid said.  We don t know to what international banks he is in debt. We don t know the extent to which his own pecuniary interests might influence his foreign policy, if his children are still running his company and there s a hotel to be built in Dubai, does that influence his reaction if the government of Dubai acts in a way we don t want, in Turkey or other countries. Here s the video via VidMe.It is absolutely critical that Trump put an end to his conflicts of interest. And the best way he can do that is to sell his company. Because any building with his name on it will become a target of terrorism over the next four years and there is not enough security to protect every building he owns. He owns hotels in Las Vegas, Chicago, and New York City just to name a few in the United States and he owns properties in Turkey, Panama, South Korea, the Philippines, India, Panama, and Uruguay. Again, just to name a few.So there are literally dozens of targets in the United States and around the world for terrorists to attack and Trump s name will be the bulls-eye. Terrorists are going to attack these properties to piss Trump off. And they are hoping Trump will launch war after war in retaliation so that more American treasure is wasted, and more American blood in spilled.Featured Image: Wikimedia",News,"December 26, 2016",3202
 FRAUD: Architect Who Was Scammed For $100k Exposes The Real Trump (VIDEO),"During Monday night s presidential debate, Hillary Clinton accused Donald Trump of screwing thousands of his workers out of the wages that they owe him. It was a shining moment for Clinton, that highlighted how Trump s entire fortune comes from not his business savvy, but his unending greed and eagerness to exploit anyone he can. Before saying that she is glad that Trump never did business with her father, she directly told Trump that he needed to apologize to all those he hurt, saying: Do the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the goods that they ve produced and then refused to pay them? One of those people that Trump stiffed over is an architect named Andrew Tesoro. Tesoro sat down for an interview on MSNBC Live, where he revealed how Trump did not pay him the $100,000 dollars that were owed to him for helping to a clubhouse at one of Trump s many golf courses. Tesoro was asked whether he was paid for the work he had done on the clubhouse. He responded by saying: No, he didn t. He paid partially along the way and the project snowballed over a four year period and our role in the project snowballed as well. We became very much involved in interior design and construction stage work. We made many supplemental agreements as we went along and in the end those agreements were not honored. Because Trump will do anything to distance himself from his fraudulent business practices, he recently asserted that Tesoro probably wasn t paid because of shoddy work. That comment should really be biting him in the ass now. That s because Tesoro revealed that Trump had written him a letter of recommendation in 2006. In the letter, Trump praised Tesoro for his work. Tesser s experience is not unique. It seems like every day that more people are coming out in droves and exposing the various ways that Trump has royally screwed them over.One report has been particularly damning. USA Today found that Trump has been involved in over 3,500 lawsuits over the past three decades. They also found that he has left everyone from cabinetmakers to carpenters left without being paid in full, or on time. While those numbers certainly make it easier to understand how far reaching Trump s fraudulent practices are, hearing it from someone who was a victim of them makes it so much more real.You can watch Tesoro expose Trump for scam artist in his own words below.

 North Carolina Authorities May Charge Trump With ‘Inciting A Riot’ Following His Violent Rally,"Donald Trump has watched from the stage as his rabid supporters have brutally assaulted the people who come out to protest him. Oftentimes, he even urges them on   whipping his followers into a violent frenzy with unfounded accusations that the protesters are working for ISIS or were sent by Bernie Sanders and  deserve it. After this week saw nearly every Trump rally end in assaults and racial and ethnic slurs, the question turned from  Will someone be killed at a Trump rally?  to  When? Trump has done absolutely nothing to tone down the rhetoric. In fact, he s stepped it up. Lately, he s begun using his supporters as a personal goon squad. When he accused Bernie Sanders fans of forcing him to cancel his rally in Chicago, he threatened to  send them  out to harass Sanders supporters. The supporters themselves seem downright eager to oblige this call to violence. The only thing missing are literal brown shirts.This again came to a head, this time in North Carolina, where Trump rallies in Concord and Fayetteville. In one disturbing, but not uncommon, incident, a black man was attacked as the crowd roared. A cowboy hat-wearing Trump superfan beamed as he told reporters that he was proud for sucker punching an African American protester as he was being escorted out. He was eventually charged with assault, but not before vowing to  kill  the man if he ever saw him again.Trump doubled-down on his claim that these protesters were  bad people  and possibly ISIS terrorists. He then encouraged his followers to be more violent when faced with protesters, again saying they were  bad  and deserved it. His supporters in the media also parroted this call to violence.I would like to see a little more violence from the innocent Trump supporters set upon by violent leftist hoodlums.  Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) March 13, 2016But North Carolina authorities are now coming out strongly against Trump attempting to turn their state into a breeding ground for fascism. Following the violent rally, the Cumberland County Sheriff s Office announced that it would be looking into charging Donald Trump   the current Republican front-runner for President of the United States by a wide margin  with inciting a riot.JUST IN: North Carolina police considering filing charges against Trump for potentially inciting a riot https://t.co/gQjG8N6tXP  MSNBC (@MSNBC) March 14, 2016A look at North Carolina s law against inciting a riot shows that Trump appears to check all the boxes. It s a wonder he hasn t been charged yet.Here's North Carolina riot law. pic.twitter.com/z9KpRPhcwH  Matt Pearce (@mattdpearce) March 14, 2016For the protesters who brave a Trump rally, the fact that the man on stage is using a microphone to actually call for the thousands of supporters in attendance to verbally or physically attack him or her, the  clear and present  danger is real. And this isn t just a thought exercise. People have been repeatedly hurt trying to escape the events. One man was pushed down and kicked. Another was elbowed in the face. Even reporters have faced violence. A TIME photographer was choke-slammed by Trump s Secret Service agent. A former Breitbart reporter was thrown to the ground by Trump s campaign manager, leaving bruises on her arm from where he grabbed her. The list goes on When Trump comes to town, you can count on two things happening: The racists crawling out of the woodwork waving Trump flags and violence directed at the people who oppose Trump. That s not a way to run a democracy. If authorities don t begin to stand up to Trump s calls for violence with criminal charges, the chances of a deadly incident happening are nearly total.The authorities in North Carolina caution that they may not charge Trump, however. Unfortunately,  inciting a riot  is known in legal circles as being notoriously difficult to prove, given how vague its language is. Trump will no doubt respond with an army of lawyers to descend on North Carolina should he find himself charged, so it is clearly making the sheriff s office gun shy. In a statement, they said they were looking into but won t make an official decision until after they ve run down a few more leads.Featured image via WRAL",News,"March 14, 2016",4204

OBAMA USES WORLD STAGE To Announce Plans For Executive Action On Gun Control In U.S.,"How very progressive And how very ironic that our tyrannical President would take the opportunity to address how he plans to implement gun control in the U.S. while standing in Paris, where only two weeks ago 130 unarmed people were slaughtered by armed terrorists.Gun control, man-made climate change, open borders, one-world order just a few of the topics our anti-American President feels right at home discussing with a few comrades Speaking from Paris, France, on December 1, President Obama criticized the lack of gun control in the U.S. and pledged to remain focused on using executive action to enact new controls where possible.Obama is in Paris for a conference on climate change.During a press conference, Obama was asked about the November 27 Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood attack that killed two civilians and a police officer. He responded by claiming  mass shootings  are a something specifically American a problem not witnessed in other countries then criticized Congressional inaction toward passing more gun control.According to Bloomberg, Obama said:In the United States we have the power to do more to prevent what is just a regular process of gun homicides, that is unequaled by multiples of five, six, [or] ten, and I think the American people understand that. So my hope is that, once again, this spurs a conversation and action.He said that  Congress, states, and local governments  need to act, and he made it clear he  will continue to focus on what [he] can do administratively,  which is something he has been threatening to do since a gunman opened fire in the gun free zone at Umpqua Community College on October 1.On November 12 CBS News reported that Obama has given a team of  White House lawyers  the job of finding a way that executive action can be used to expand background checks. And Breitbart News reported that part of what is being sought is an arbitrary threshold that can be set on private gun sales. Citizens who sell more than the allowable level will be forced to do background checks on every sale.Obama and the Democrat Party have been obsessed with expanding background checks since Adam Lanza attacked Sandy Hook Elementary on December 14, 2012. Yet it is interesting to note that expanded background checks would not have hindered that attack in the slightest, because Lanza stole the guns he used he did not buy them.Moreover, background checks are already expanded in Colorado. Breitbart News previously reported that expanded background checks and a  high capacity  magazine ban are the law of the land in Colorado, but neither were effectual in stopping the Planned Parenthood attack or the high profile public shooting that took place in CO Springs on Halloween day.

PRIORITIES: Who Does Obama Invite To White House…The Muslim “Briefcase Clock” Boy Or Slain Cops Families?,"Hey Barack Hussein Obama America is still waiting for statement about any of the recent violent murders of innocent cops. But you can t be bothered right? God forbid you address the war on law enforcement (that you started), because it s not nearly as important to you as shining a spotlight on supposed racial inequality is it? President Barack Obama issued a personal invitation via Twitter to a Muslim high school student who got in trouble last week in Texas for bringing a home made  briefcase clock  to school, touching off a terrorism scare.Cool clock, Ahmed. Want to bring it to the White House? We should inspire more kids like you to like science. It's what makes America great.  President Obama (@POTUS44) September 16, 2015Fourteen year-old Ahmed Mohamed was taken in handcuffs by police from MacArthur High School in Irving, Texas after he brought his invention to school the Monday after the fourteenth anniversary of the 9/11 Islamist terror attacks on the U.S. An alarm for the briefcase clock went off in class, prompting a teacher to observe the devise looked like a bomb. Police investigated and on Wednesday announced no charges would be filed. Cool clock, Ahmed. Want to bring it to the White House? We should inspire more kids like you to like science. It s what makes America great.At Wednesday s press briefing held right after Obama tweeted his invitation to Mohamed, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest attacked the teachers at Mohamed s school for erring on the side of caution in an era of Islamist terror attacks and  troubled student  school massacres.Earnest also announced Obama was inviting Mohamed to the White House Astronomy Night on October 19. (Quotes assembled from transcribing and various sources.) I think the president like many of us was struck by the news reports of this particular incident. The fact is that America s best teachers in our schools, in our best schools at least, nurture the intellectual curiosity of all of our students. In this instance it is clear that at least some of Ahmed s teachers failed him. That s too bad (It s not) too late for all of us to use this as a teachable moment. This episode is a good illustration of how pernicious stereotypes can prevent even goodhearted people who have dedicated their lives to educating young people from doing the good work they set out to do. This is an instance where you have people who have otherwise dedicated their lives to teach our children who failed in that effort, potentially because of some things in their conscience and the power of stereotypes. The White House was pleased to extend an invitation to Ahmed to participate in Astronomy Night. We ll bring together NASA scientists, others to spend time with young people. It will be an opportunity to talk about science, the solar system. It should be a good event. We re hopeful he ll feel right at home. Ahmed Mohamed has become an instant celebrity and sees his case as one of  racial inequality  rather than about his poor judgment for bringing to school a device that looked like a bomb.Here he is bragging about getting ready to sue the school:Going to meet my lawyer. pic.twitter.com/YCxOOeOz3Z  Ahmed Mohamed (@IStandWithAhmed) September 16, 2015Here are some of the tweets that offering Ahmed Mohamed support:@IStandWithAhmed @IBJIYONGI @anildash I hope someone from @MIT reaches out to Ahmed with a full scholarship.

Man shot inside Paris police station. Just announced that terror threat is at highest level,  Trump tweeted Thursday.  Germany is a total mess-big crime.

 It’s Mueller Time!: Russia Probe Just Got Worse For Trump And It’s Going To Hurt,"Justice Department deputy solicitor general Michael Dreeben will assist Robert Mueller and he s no slacker. He has argued more than 100 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court so his resume is worthy of joining the investigation into possible coordination between Trump s associates and Russian officials. Donald Trump had better stock up on aspirin because team Mueller is going to be all up in his business. The move signals that Mueller may be seeking advice on complex areas of criminal law, including what constitutes obstruction of justice and that has been an issue of debate for a while now. Most recently, when former FBI Director James Comey testified Thursday.Dreeben is the department s go-to lawyer on criminal justice cases and is highly respected by Democrats and Republicans alike due to his encyclopedic knowledge of criminal law, according to the Washington Post.Dreeben has been pulled into the investigation to work part time for Mueller while he continues to oversee the department s criminal appellate cases, according to Justice officials.According to former and current Justice Department officials, Mueller s recruitment of Dreeben into the probe shows how serious he is about the investigation and signals complexities in the investigation.Dreeben is thought of as brilliant in his area of expertise:Michael is the most brilliant and most knowledgeable federal criminal lawyer in America   period,  said Walter Dellinger, a law professor at Duke University School of Law and acting solicitor general for the 1996-1997 term of the Supreme Court. I learned early on in my time as acting [solicitor general] that there was no point of ever thinking of second-guessing Michael on a matter of federal criminal law because he just knew more than I did or could ever know,  Dellinger said.  He s a straight shooter, and is held in the greatest esteem by the FBI and lawyers in U.S. attorneys offices all over the country. It s not just Dreeben:Mueller s team includes Jeannie Rhee, a former deputy assistant attorney general and a partner in the investigations practice at WilmerHale, and Andrew Weissmann, the chief of the Justice Department s fraud section who oversaw corruption investigations including the probe into cheating by Volkswagen on diesel emissions tests over.Aaaand, Trump s lawyer can t even spell  President  so that s kind of sad, don t you think?

TSA: US Residents from 9 States Will Need Passports for Domestic Flights,"This latest move by America s notorious Transportation Security Authority (TSA) seems to be step one in a move towards a national ID Card, complete with biometrics and embedded RFID technology.By forcing residents of nine states to get passports in order to board domestic flights, the TSA is de facto pushing those states towards the implementation of a new state-of-the-art ID card system.This will help to give real teeth to the  The Real ID Act It s just the next phase in the further militarization of US society.Forbes reports You may have thought you don t need a passport because you don t travel outside the United States. But for residents of nine states, that will change at the beginning of 2018 for any commercial flight, whether international or domestic.Nine states will no longer allow travelers to board an airplane with just their state issued driver s licenses as of January 22, 2018. To get past TSA security checkpoints, another form of identification will be required: passport, permanent resident card/green card or a military ID.The Real ID Act of 2005 states that state-issued IDs from these nine states do not meet the minimum security standards of the federal government:With just a few months until the Real ID Act goes into full effect, it is time to start planning now and look into getting your passport. Here is the airport signage, placed around the security checkpoints in airports to remind U.S. travelers of what;s to come (with my emphasis): Starting January 22, 2018, you will need a driver s license or ID from a state compliant with the REAL ID ACT, a state that has an extension for compliance, or an alternate ID to fly. For REAL ID information, and a list of acceptable IDs, visit tsa.gov.  Some states have started working on offering federally approved issued IDs that would not require a passport for domestic air travel. Check with your local government office to see if there is a different type of ID you can apply for, and the TSA website to clarify this situation. Because on January 22, 2018, the enforcement for those nine states will go into effect, and by 2020, even more people will end up needing a passport, as confirmed by the official website of the Transportation Security Administration.To repeat, if you re going to take a flight and you have a state-issued ID from one of those nine states listed above, unless your state has made federally approved changes before January, you should use a passport to go anywhere across the country, as all domestic travel is included in these new standards.

 Obama Eyeing Digital Media Career Post-Presidency,"Before Donald Trump pulled off winning the presidency (which no one saw coming), there were reports that the billionaire mogul was preparing to potentially launch a TV news network that would be even more outrageous than Fox News   hence why he ran for president: he needed to build an audience.But now he s going to be President of the United States, so that won t be happening.However, there is one person who may be eyeing a career in media   President Obama.According to multiple sources that spoke to Mic, President Obama is looking into launching a digital media company, and that media will be the  focus  of the next chapter of his life.Mic is also reporting   albeit another anonymous source   that President Obama and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg talked about the post-presidency prospects at a meeting in Lima, Peru during the APEC summit.White House communications director told Mic that the president (as of now) has no plans to get into the media industry:While the president will remain actively engaged in inspiring young people and he is interested in the changing ways people consume information, he has no plans to get into the media business after he leaves office.When Rolling Stone had asked President Obama what his post-presidential plans would entail, he gave the American people the first clue that could actually tie into a media launch against right-wing B.S.:How do we rethink our storytelling, the messaging and the use of technology and digital media, so that we can make a persuasive case across the country?There s an easy answer to that question: Obama TV, or the Obama News Network.Now that the world is creeping up on a Trump presidency, who better to reach out and offer sanity to the public than President Obama, who has pledged he will not keep quiet on the sidelines.Having Bill O Reilly and the other right-wing blowhards like Tomi Lahren compete against President Obama and his people for ratings would be a marvelous sight to behold.With millennials constantly being turned off by the political process (and always on social media), a network launch from one of greatest presidents this country has ever seen may not be such a bad idea. Perhaps Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert could come onboard.With Democrats taking over the conversation from the noise at Fox News, the possibilities are endless.Featured image via Sean Gallup/Getty Images",News,"December 3, 2016",2388
First Time in 30 Years: US Deploys B-52 Bombers to Qatar to bomb… ISIS?,"21st Century Wire says Is Washington preparing to carpet bomb Raqqa? If so, what will be the  trigger  for this boldly adroit military maneuver to deploy B-52 Bombers to the Middle East?Back in Dec 2015, GOP contender Ted Cruz vowed he would  carpet bomb ISIS  if elected president (and to hell with any collateral damage). He recently repeated that call on FOX network s Kelly File show. If I am elected president, we will defeat radical Islamic terrorism, and we will utterly destroy ISIS,  he said.  And yes that means carpet bombing them into oblivion.  But it s not Cruz ramping up the Pentagon s military footprint   it s Barack Obama who is the international aggressor, but he s  leading from behind  safely in the background in order to preserve his party s fast-diminishing dovish allure in a delicate election year.Regardless, the U.S. are desperate to save face in the Middle East after 5 years of failed policy and arming terrorists in Syria and northern Iraq while acting as if they were forming a Coalition to defeat the terrorists   a totally fraudulent narrative (yes, you read that correctly, and the evidence is now in).Is this a sign of thing to come..?In a conventional conflict, the B-52 can perform air interdiction, offensive counter-air and maritime operations. During Desert Storm, B-52s delivered 40 percent of all the weapons dropped by coalition forces. It is highly effective when used for ocean surveillance, and can assist the U.S. Navy in anti-ship and mine-laying operations. Two B-52s, in two hours, can monitor 140,000 square miles (364,000 square kilometers) of ocean surface. All B-52s are equipped with an electro-optical viewing system that uses platinum silicide forward-looking infrared and high resolution low-light-level television sensors to augment the targeting, battle assessment, flight safety and terrain-avoidance system, thus further improving its combat ability and low-level flight capability. (U.S. Air Force photo) RTAmerican B-52 Stratofortress bombers have been sent for their first Middle East operational deployment since the 1991 Gulf War 26 years ago. The aircraft are flying from Qatar to bomb Islamic State targets.An undisclosed number of B-52s have arrived at the Al Udeid Air Base on Sunday, the US Air Force said. The B-52 will provide the coalition continued precision and deliver desired airpower effects, Lt. Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., commander, US Air Forces Central Command said in the statement.The B-52 is a long-range multi-purpose heavy bomber. The Central Command last used them during Operation Desert Storm against Saddam Hussein s Iraq, when the aircraft flew sorties from Saudi Arabia.The deployment is meant to replace a contingent of B-1 Lancer swing-wing bombers which departed the Middle East in January for maintenance and a series of upgrades, the US Army s Stars and Stripes reported. The B-52 demonstrates our continued resolve to apply persistent pressure on Daesh and defend the region in any future contingency,  Brown said, referring to Islamic State by its Arabic-language acronym.The deployment comes shortly after Russia used its long-range Tupolev Tu-22, Tu-95 and Tu-160 bombers to strike terrorist targets in Syria. The Russian aircraft flew from their home bases over the Caspian Sea, Iran and Iraq to reach the Syrian territory.READ MORE PENTAGON NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Pentagon Files",US_News,"April 10, 2016",3390

 The Internet EVISCERATES Whiny Nikki Haley After She Complains About Having To Do Her Job (TWEETS),"The Donald Trump Administration has to be the whiniest in history. Of course, they are all a bunch of spoiled, moneyed, grown up brats, so this is no surprise. Once a trust fund baby who appreciates nothing and was born with a silver spoon in your mouth, and there s no turning back. You either become a decent person because you had decent parents and morals and values plus a basic sense of awareness and decency yourself, or you become a rich asshole. Trump being Trump, of course, picked other rich assholes like himself. Case in point   United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley.Now, I know that Haley is awful. I live in South Carolina and lived under the tyranny of her governorship until Trump scooped her up to work in his administration. Therefore, her 4th of July tweet came as no surprise to me. Since the nutjob who runs North Korea is an ever-increasing nuclear threat, all relevant hands had to be on deck on Independence Day, since there had been yet another North Korean ballistic missile test less than 24 hours before. This one is especially grave, since there is every possibility that it could strike our nation. However, what is Nikki Haley worried about? Certainly not Kim Jung-un. No. She is worried about having to work on the holiday. Ambassador Haley tweeted:Spending my 4th in meetings all day. #ThanksNorthKorea  Nikki Haley (@nikkihaley) July 4, 2017Luckily, the good people of Twitter were on the job for this one, as per usual. They instantly railed Haley, and made her remember just what Independence Day and patriotism are all about:What job did you think you were signing up for, exactly?

SHOCKING HYPOCRISY: THE MOST RACIST INDUSTRY IN AMERICA,"So much for tolerance and diversity How would you describe an industry in which the number of blacks employed has now dropped to 1968 levels?Think about it. In 1968 democrats were still fighting to keep blacks from being equal to whites. Actually the number of blacks employed in this industry is worse than in 1968 when you take their percentage of the overall population into account. In 1968 blacks accounted for 10.9% of the population. Today they constitute 13.2% of the population. So, what industry is the most rife with racism? The media.Is this just too delicious for words or what? The same media who inflate and lie about news stories in order to inject racism into the mix, themselves are the biggest racists in America. Today, only 4.78% of all newsroom employees are black. In 1968 there were less than 5% employed in the newsroom. So basically the same percentage despite the fact that there are many more blacks today that in 1968.Take a look at this White House press conference and tell me how many blacks you see:This is typical of liberals,  Do as I say and not as I do.  Alex T. Williams of the Columbia Journalism Review (CJR) breaks down the numbers for al minorities: The percentage of minorities employed in daily newspapers (the ASNE looks at black, Hispanic, Asian American, Native American, and multiracial populations) has increased from 3.95 percent in 1978, when the ASNE began conducting the census, to 13.34 percent in 2014. The Radio Television Digital News Association estimates that in 2014, minorities made up 13 percent of journalists in radio and 22.4 percent of journalists in television. Still, these figures are a far cry from the 37.4 percent of Americans that are minorities. It s not a matter of blacks not wanting to be newsroom workers. To the contrary, there are plenty of black college graduates who majored in journalism. It s just that the media won t hire them. More from Williams of CJR: Here, I found an alarming trend. Comparing the 2013 job placement rates, graduating minorities that specialized in print were 17 percentage points less likely to find a full-time job than non-minorities; minorities specializing in broadcasting were 17 percentage points less likely to find a full-time job; and minorities specializing in public relations were 25 percentage points less likely to find a full-time job. In contrast, minorities specializing in advertising were only 2 percentage points less likely to find a full-time job than their white counterparts.

 Twitter Destroys Trump For Using Dwyane Wade’s Personal Tragedy To Pander For Black Votes,"Donald Trump s pathetic effort to reach out to black voters got even more disgusting on Saturday, and social media took him to the woodshed for it.On Friday, 32-year-old Nykea Aldridge was killed in Chicago after two gunmen opened fire on another man. She was an innocent bystander who was simply picking up her kids from school.She s also the cousin of Chicago Bulls star Dwyane Wade, who has spoken out repeatedly against gun violence.Wade announced his cousin s death via Twitter, expressing his grief and once again condemning the gun violence that has plagued the city.My cousin was killed today in Chicago. Another act of senseless gun violence. 4 kids lost their mom for NO REASON. Unreal. #EnoughIsEnough  DWade (@DwyaneWade) August 27, 2016Wade s mother, a pastor, spoke at the hospital where her niece died.

We re still going to try and help these people to transform their minds and give them a different direction, so this thing won t keep happening.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 27, 2016Trump literally used this tragedy to declare that black people will vote for him even though he has not specified how he will prevent these shootings from continuing. Wade and his family have not even had time to mourn their loss and Trump is already politicizing it for personal gain.This is about as sick as politics gets, and to add insult to injury, Trump couldn t even be bothered to spell Wade s first name correctly.And as usual, Twitter was quick to jump all over Trump for his insensitivity and lack of human compassion.

TWO “HIGH THREAT” EXPLOSIVE Experts Moved From GITMO To African Country With Over 90% Muslim Population [VIDEO],"If someone would have told me in 2008 that we would be releasing Muslim explosive experts from GITMO to a country where over 90% of its citizens were Muslim, I m quite sure I would have thought they were out of their minds. Fast forward to 2016 and the idea that this is really happening is barely registering as a blip on the radar of most Americans. Have Obama s radical policies, that have largely gone unchecked, and his open disregard for our national security caused Americans to ignore the treason his is committing against our nation? Two of Al Qaeda s former explosives experts were just transferred out of Guantanamo Bay and sent to Senegal, the Defense Department confirmed Monday, marking the latest detainees to be shipped out of the prison camp despite the risk they could return to the battlefield.The two Libyan former detainees were separately listed as threats to U.S. interests in Department of Defense documents obtained by Wikileaks and The New York Times.Salem Abdu Salam Ghereby is believed to have fought coalition forces at Usama bin Laden s Tora Bora complex in Afghanistan  and was associated with senior members of Al Qaeda.  Omar Khalif Mohammed Abu Baker Major Umar was assessed to be likely to  immediately seek out prior associates and reengage in hostilities and extremist support activities  upon his release, according to a 2008 government document.The news comes as senators prepare to introduce legislation to permanently block transfers of Guantanamo detainees to terror hot spots and state sponsors of terrorism including Yemen, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Iran and Sudan. Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., was expected to introduce a bill as early as Monday, Fox News has learned.The transfer of Ghereby and Umar reduces the Guantanamo detainee population to 89, according to the Department of Defense. They are part of the Obama administration s long-running and controversial effort to reduce the prison population and ultimately close the camp.By law, the Pentagon must notify Congress 30 days in advance of any detainee transfer. The first notification for the individuals now identified as Ghereby and Umar was in early March. Others are expected in the next few weeks. We are taking all possible steps to reduce the detainee population at Guantanamo and to close the detention facility in a responsible manner that protects our national security,  Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement on Monday.Via: FOX News",politics,"Apr 4, 2016",2452

HERE’S WHY HILLARY CLINTON FORBIDS PRESS From Taking Photos Of Private Jet Travel THAT COSTS MILLIONS,"Eureka! We figured out why Hillary won t let the press see her off: The campaign of Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton has poured more than $2 million into the use of private jets this election cycle, according to a review of its expenditures.Federal Election Commission documents reviewed by the Washington Free Beacon found that Hillary for America made a total of 48 payments from June 1, 2015, to Jan. 29, 2016, to Executive Fliteways, a New York-based private jet company, running up a tab of $2,128,293 for the campaign.Executive Fliteways is considered  one of the largest independently owned and operated charter companies in the country  and boasts a fleet of private planes ranging from  mid-size,  which can seat seven or eight passengers, to  heavy,  which can carry 12 to 16 people.While it is not clear which jet Clinton prefers on the campaign trail, or if they routinely switch between the jets they use, Clinton has been pinned on Executive Fliteways  Falcon 900B  heavy jet  in the past, according to a media reports. Hillary boarded the plane, which burns 347 gallons of fuel per hour, shortly after laying out her campaign s plan to combat global warming.ABC REPORTER Liz Kreutz TWEETED OUT THIS MESSAGE WITH A PHOTO:     Clinton staff won t allow press to film HRC boarding her charter.

GA TOWN MANDATES GUN OWNERSHIP: Here’s What Happened To The Crime Rate…,"The results of this town s gun ownership mandate shows what happens when there are armed civilians out there In 1982, the little town of Kennesaw, Georgia passed an ordinance that every able bodied family must own a gun. Here is the text of the ordinance:(a) In order to provide for the emergency management of the city, and further in order to provide for and protect the safety, security and general welfare of the city and its inhabitants, every head of household residing in the city limits is required to maintain a firearm, together with ammunition therefore.(b)Exempt from the effect of this section are those heads of households who suffer a physical or mental disability which would prohibit them from using such a firearm. Further exempt from the effect of this section are those heads of households who are paupers or who conscientiously oppose maintaining firearms as a result of beliefs or religious doctrine, or persons convicted of a felony.An amendment to the gun ownership law grants exceptions to convicted felons, conscientious objectors and those who cannot afford a gun.In 2007, there was a follow up, showing the effects of the law on crime and the city. The liberals of course warned that Kennesaw would become the Wild West. Like all liberal predictions, this one belongs in the sewer. (Make sure you flush twice, it s a long ways to DNC HQ) In the 25 years that the law had been in place as of 2007 not one murder or defensive shooting took place. The first murder finally did occur in 2014, 32 years into the ordinance. The population soared from 5,242 to 28,189. The year prior to the passage of the ordinance, the city had a crime rate of (4,332 per 100,000). That was higher than the national average of (3,899 per 100,000). As of 2007, the crime rate had dropped to (2,268 per 100,000). The current crime rate for Kennesaw has dropped to (1,760 Per 100,000)In fact, Family Circle Magazine ranked Kennesaw as one of the ten best cities for families to live in. Kennesaw came in at Number 5. Kennesaw is far from being the one exception to the rule.The DOJ released a report that covered the years 1993 to 2011, a period in which gun ownership soared. What did they find? In 1993 there were 18,253 gun deaths. In 2011 there were just 11,101. Even more startling is that non fatal shootings dropped by 69%!!What about the liberal propaganda that gun shows are the case of most gun shootings because there are no background checks? The DOJ found that gun felons in federal prisons got just 2% of their guns from gun shows. 10 percent said they purchased their gun from a retail shop or pawnshop, 37 percent obtained it from family or friends, and another 40 percent obtained it from an illegal source.Concealed carriers also assisted in dropping crime rates during the years of the Obama caliphate. The number of concealed carry permits in 2007 was 4.6 million and has now soared to 12.8 million. That number is actually much higher since 8 states now do not require a concealed carry permit. During this same period, gun deaths dropped from 5.6 million to 4.2 million per 100,000.Harvard studied gun policies around the world and found to their astonishment that more guns mean less crime.One last item. What about the vaunted Gun free Zones? Are they working? Yes, but only for mass murderers. Since the 1950s, all but two mass shootings took place in gun free zones.Via: The PC Graveyard",Government News,"Jan 11, 2016",3416
 Listen To Ann Coulter Pretend She Likes Jews While Making Vile Anti-Semitic Statement (AUDIO),"Donald Trump s number one fangirl, Ann Coulter, believes we have a superior culture we must keep pure. To that end, she thinks that small pockets of certain types of people in the U.S. are fine, so long as they don t overwhelm our wealthy, white, Christian, European culture. Guess who else she said that about? Jewish people.In an interview with BBC Radio 4, the following exchange took place: Americans don t want immigration,  Coulter said, demanding a complete halt.  They don t want any more. Why can t we have a home? BBC interviewer James Naughtie challenged her:  If someone had said that about Jewish immigration into New York a century ago, would you have approved of it? Oh God, not the Jews again,  the exasperated Coulter exclaimed. That s like two percent of the population,  she added.  That did not overwhelm our culture.' Listen to her her put her bigotry on full display below: Why can t we have a home?  We do have a home. That question makes absolutely no sense   she acts like white Christians are being forced out. Has that ever happened to a culture before? Oh, wait, yes it has, when her vaunted white, Christian Europeans forced Native Americans out of their homes.Seeing as how Christianity was born from Judaism, and Jesus Christ himself was a Jew, she takes an odd position on Jews. But Coulter is one of the worst bigots we ve got   that s why she supports Donald Trump. Despite her enduring love for him though, while Trump was talking about how Israel has no greater supporter than himself during one of the GOP debates last year, she tweeted,  How many f ing Jews do these people think there are in the United States? The implication is that she believes Jews have an outsized influence here. She claims that s not the case, though; she was merely talking about how Republicans act like our Jewish population has an outsized influence. She s not the anti-Semite here; or, at least, on her planet she s not an anti-Semite.That s in spite of the fact that she also said, at the time, that Republicans are merely pandering to the Jews. Who is she pandering to, then? Probably Donald Trump.She says anti-Semitic stuff fairly frequently, and then she puts on her walking contradiction costume when she defends herself: Anyone with a pulse knows I am pro-Israel and against the enemies of the Jewish people. I have a whole chapter in my current book praising Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. It s the people attacking me who couldn t care less about Israel or Jews. She ll never admit she s said something sick and wrong. That s probably another reason she s a Trump fangirl. He doesn t admit when he s wrong, either.

 WATCH: Hypocrite Mike Pence Calls Democratic Obstruction Of Trump’s Supreme Court Nominee ‘Unprecedented’,"This is unbelievably outrageous.Republicans are literally pretending that the last eight years never happened.In February 2016, Justice Antonin Scalia passed away, leaving a vacancy on the Supreme Court that President Obama was responsible to fill. But Scalia s body was not even cold before Republicans vowed to block any nominee he selected for the position.And so, Republicans did just that and refused to even grant Merrick Garland a hearing despite the fact that he is a moderate centrist who enjoyed support from Republicans in the past.Republicans excused their unprecedented behavior by claiming that lame-duck presidents can t pick Supreme Court nominees and claimed that the American people should get a say in November about who should pick the next Supreme Court Justice.Th GOP has three problems here. First, President Obama was elected twice by the American people and therefore had the right to choose the nominee. Second, there is plenty of historical examples of presidents picking Supreme Court nominees and getting them confirmed during their final year in office. Ronald Reagan is one of them. And finally, the American people did not vote for Donald Trump, they voted for Hillary Clinton by nearly 3 million votes.So Trump definitely does not have a mandate and Republicans do not have any excuses for their obstruction.But Democrats certainly do have a really good excuse to block Trump s nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the high court. After all, Republicans created the new precedent last year by refusing to confirm Garland. Republicans literally stole a Supreme Court seat from President Obama and the Democratic Party.But Mike Pence claims that even threatening to obstruct Trump s nominee is  unprecedented. During a speech to the Federalist Society, Pence promised that Gorsuch  will pick up where Scalia left off.  In other words, he ll be a complete dick who wants to repeal every Supreme Court ruling that protects the rights of women, minorities, gay people, the environment, etc until this nation is taken all the way back to the 1850s.And then he said this. Several announced their opposition within minutes of his nomination, and now they re even threatening to use the filibuster procedure in the Senate to stop him. Make no mistake about it, this is an unwise and an unprecedented act .This seat does not belong to any party or any ideology or any interest group, this seat on the Supreme Court belongs to the American people, and the American people deserve a vote on the floor of the United States Senate. Here s the video via YouTube.Democrats should block Trump s Supreme Court pick at all costs. Turnabout is fair play and Republicans are hypocrites for whining about obstruction when they are the ones who totally disrespected President Obama and Merrick Garland in the first place. They only have themselves to blame for what Democrats are threatening to do and they have no right to complain after the way they acted last year. If Republicans wanted Democrats to cooperate with Trump, they should have thought about that before acting like complete traitors toward President Obama.Republicans wanted the Supreme Court to just have eight justices and that has lasted for a year now. It s time for Democrats to extend that wait to another four years. And if Republicans change the rules to force Gorsuch on the Supreme Court, Democrats should impeach him and Trump when they get control of Congress and show Republicans what the word  unprecedented  really means.Featured image via screenshot",News,"February 4, 2017",3534
 WATCH: Fox News Host Viciously Attacks Michelle Obama In HIGHLY Disrespectful Rant,"Fox News banshee Jeanine Pirro threw a hissy fit this weekend because First Lady Michelle Obama correctly stated how most people feel since Donald Trump became president-elect.On Friday, Mrs. Obama sat down for her final interview as First Lady with Oprah Winfrey and expressed what millions of Americans are feeling right now as President Obama enter the last month of his presidency. We feel the difference now,  she said.  See, now, we are feeling what not having hope feels like. Hope is necessary. It s a necessary concept and Barack didn t just talk about hope because he thought it was just a nice slogan to get votes. Indeed, the only ones who didn t feel hope in 2008 were conservatives who vowed from day one to sabotage President Obama at every turn, hurling racism and hate every step of the way for the last eight years. But even more Americans are going to sorely miss him and the optimism he brought to the office. Donald Trump, however, is no Barack Obama. As Trump continues to hire people who hate the department they have been picked to head and picks fights with foreign nations and is poised to dismantle every program that made this country great already, millions of Americans are horrified and living in fear of what this nation is about to become.Of course, Pirro had a problem with Michelle Obama telling the truth, so she lashed out at her for five minutes by blaming her for everything from beheadings in the Middle East to protests against police.Basically, Pirro bitched about Michelle Obama in every little way and acted like a petulant child. To try and convince America that once you and Barack exit the White House, hope is removed for America is an outrage,  Pirro whined.  But I get it, for you hope is gone. You and your family and friends won t be able to fly to another 46 countries, with security and hair and make-up in tow. Michelle, you may not realize it, but Americans  rejected you and everything you stand for. Hope is when people   30,000 at a time   stand in line in the cold with their children hoping to get a glimpse of a man they think can change the course of their lives from the downward spiral that you and  Mister Hope and Change  have put them on. Here s the video via YouTube.Of course, Americans did not  reject  the Obamas in this election at all. In fact, Obama s approval rating is higher than Trump s and millions would have preferred voting for him a third time. Also, Russia helped Trump steal the election and Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by nearly three million votes. Most Americans also fear a Trump presidency. Someone should explain to Pirro that fear is the opposite of hope.As someone who claims to support women s rights, one would think Pirro would also be concerned about Trump being in the White House considering the way he has treated women over the years. Pirro is also pro-choice, which goes against Republicans who currently aim to eliminate Roe v. Wade in the next four years. So women across the country have every reason and right to be losing hope since their freedom could be seriously restricted. But apparently, Pirro forgot about women and the plight they are about to face.Once again, Pirro is demonstrating that she s a racist bitch who hates successful women for speaking their minds and telling the truth.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"December 18, 2016",3335
PARKS and REC and JIMMY FALLON Writer Thinks Trump Supporters Should Drink Bleach…Hopes Trump Gets Cancer," When they go low we go high.

JOHN KERRY BREAKS LEG IN BIKE CRASH IN FRENCH ALPS… [Video],"Fortunately, our useless Secretary of State John Kerry was able to make France a part of his taxpayer funded four-nation trip where he had hoped to ride along a small part of the Tour de France according to the Washington Post. Unfortunately, he was unable to take part in the Tour de France or um Iran s nuclear negotiations due to his accident. Our nation is likely better off without John Kerry at the negotiating table with Iran s prime minister anyhow US Secretary of State John Kerry broke his leg in a bike crash Sunday, apparently after hitting a curb while taking a break after talks in Geneva, Switzerland.The diplomat was biking near Scionzier, France before the accident, which caused him to scrap the rest of a four-nation trip that included an international conference on combating the Islamic State group.Kerry, 71, was in stable condition and in good spirits as he prepared to return to Boston for further treatment with the doctor who previously operated on his hip, US State Department spokesman John Kirby said.He said X-rays at a Swiss hospital confirmed that Kerry fractured his right femur in the 9.40am incident. The secretary is stable and never lost consciousness, his injury is not life-threatening and he is expected to make a full recovery,  Kirby said in a statement.Kerry was taken by helicopter to Geneva s main medical center, HUG, after apparently hitting a curb with his bike in the French town about 40 kilometers southeast of the Swiss border.Paramedics and a physician were on the scene with his motorcade at the time and provided him immediate attention. They quickly decided to order the 10-minute-long helicopter transport.Kerry s cycling rides have become a regular occurrence on his trips. He often takes his bike with him on the plane and was riding that bicycle Sunday. Via: UK Daily Mail",politics,"May 31, 2015",1832
BEN CARSON FURIOUS As Republican Senate Group Uses Sneaky Tactic To Fundraise…Only It’s Not For Ben,"What a slap in the face to a strong candidate who has received little to no attention by the traditional GOP pundits and RINO s who run the party and manipulate the candidate s popularity Dr. Ben Carson, a 2016 GOP presidential candidate, is furious that the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) would use his birthday to try to boost its fundraising coffers. The NRSC has recently sent out fundraising emails and online ads soliciting donations under the guise of wishing Dr. Carson a happy birthday,  Carson communications director Doug Watts told Breitbart News on Thursday.While he surely appreciates their good wishes, he is less than happy they never bothered the common courtesy of advising our campaign. Contributors should be advised that none of the proceeds or names are being shared with the campaign. This is the kind of politics-as-usual approach Americans are tired of, deceitful Washington practices to feather the nests of the political class.Andrea Bozek, an NRSC spokeswoman, told Breitbart News in response on Friday that the group was just trying to wish Carson a happy birthday. First we are hearing of it,  Bozek said.  We simply wanted to wish Dr. Carson a Happy Birthday. The NRSC fundraising pitch was sent out in an email paid for by the NRSC and wishes Carson a Happy Birthday via Town Hall magazine media. Carson s birthday is Friday, Sept. 18.The email, addressed to  Friend,  reads as following: Just wanted to let you know that Republican presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson celebrates his birthday this week! Dr. Carson is a strong conservative who has saved many lives during his time working as a neurosurgeon. Please join us in wishing Dr. Ben Carson a happy birthday and sign his birthday card today! That links off to a website from the NRSC putting forward a birthday card for Carson but also collecting email addresses and soliciting donations for the GOP campaign committee for U.S. Senate Republicans.Carson has proven to be a prolific fundraiser. In fact, Carson s communications director Watts told Breitbart News in Simi Valley, California at the Reagan Library that in just the month of September, Carson has  raised $5.5 million in the first 15 days. We hit our 500,000th donation with 300,000 unique donors,  Watts told Breitbart News on the spin room floor.  It s really the grassroots exploding, as they re seeing the possibility of an outsider winning. Their efforts matter and their small donations matter. Watts told Breitbart News that the  average donation is around $49 to $51. About 90 percent of our contributors are under $200,  Watts said.FOR ENTIRE STORY: Matthew Boyle, Breitbart News",politics,"Sep 18, 2015",2659
"WATCH: INTOLERANT GAY COFFEE SHOP Owner Screams Profanities at Christian Pro-Life Group, Kicks Them Out Of Business: “I’m gay.

WHY DID THE UN HAVE A PRO-GUN CONTROL MEETING AT SPA IN MEXICO And Why Weren’t Dissenters Allowed?,"Government officials using other people s money to enjoy a swanky seaside vacation in Mexico while discussing how to take away our right to bear arms Sounds about right The first annual meeting of the nations that have ratified the 2014 Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) opened on Monday, August 24 at a spa in Canc n, Mexico. The treaty s been controversial in the U.S. from the moment negotiations on it began, and this meeting will surely stoke the suspicions of those who think the treaty s real aim is to crimp America s sovereignty and constitutional liberties.The meeting was originally supposed to be in Mexico City, but wouldn t you rather spend your off-hours by the pool?Of course, you may think it s weird, or sick, that all these nations pretend to believe that the best place to discuss the arms trade is at a seaside resort. After all, many of them spend all their time pleading poverty and demanding aid from the U.S. to implement the treaty.But frankly, they don t care how bad it looks. They ve got a great boondoggle going, and no one s going to spoil it for them.But everyone s going to Mexico not just because it s got great beaches. Mexico has been one of the leading campaigners for the ATT. It wants to use the treaty to promote gun control in the U.S.Mexico s theory is that, since any gun in the U.S. might at some point conceivably cross the U.S. border, all U.S. guns have to be controlled in the name of controlling the international arms trade. That s not going to happen at this meeting (or ever, if the U.S. retains its sanity).But Mexico, the other nations that agree with it, and  progressive  groups that campaigned for the treaty the blame-America-first activists, in other words are in this game for the long haul. So it s not a good sign that Mexico s been given the job of hosting the first treaty meeting.It s even less good that Mexico s spent much of the past year colluding with the activists to keep skeptics (like myself) out of the room. Their view was that only true believers who campaigned for the treaty should be allowed to see what s going on.You might wonder what they re afraid of. We skeptics make no secret of our views, but we re a well-mannered bunch: no spitballs. However, if we were always in the room, we d report on exactly how closely the activists are working with Mexico and other likeminded nations.The activists led by the global Control Arms Coalition, which has a massive presence at Canc n are the only insiders in the treaty process, and they want to keep it that way.The ATT was adopted through the U.N., which means it was drafted by the world s nations. That s bad, because there are lots of incapable and evil governments in the world. But it s better than the alternative, which was for the ATT to have been drafted solely by the activists.Now that the treaty exists, however, the activists want to take it over and direct it for their own purposes. What they want is to turn the ATT into an arms control and disarmament treaty.Keeping skeptics away is part of that campaign.So far, they ve not succeeded in keeping us out, or in taking over the treaty. But the ATT isn t simply a treaty that s over and done with. Like many treaties, it s a process that will go on and on, in meeting after meeting, year after year. And the activists have lots of people, lots of money, and lots of time.The U.S. s goal in Canc n should be to do whatever it can to prevent the activists from getting any footholds. That means ensuring a treaty secretariat that s strictly limited in its purposes, conference rules that don t privilege the activists, and reporting requirements that don t go beyond current U.S. practice or identify individual U.S. firearms owners.Via: Daily Signal",politics,"Sep 5, 2015",3732
 Billionaire SuperPAC Launches Ad Against $15 Min. Wage And Bernie Sanders (VIDEO),"The billionaire class is getting very scared of two things: the fight for 15 movement and Bernie Sanders.The grassroots movement to elect Bernie Sanders and the movement to elect Bernie Sanders are very much fueled by the same thing. A drive to make the United States a nation, that once again, allows for all people to live a dignified life.Here is the ad:Of course, the billionaire class is not having any of that nonsense. That s why the Future 45 Super PAC is running an ad that tries to take out two progressive birds at the same time. The Intercept reports that future 45 is being run by Brian O. Walsh. He is a major player in the conservative dark money network, that works to bash left-wing candidates and issues.Future 45 appears to be primarily funded by two hedge fund managers that are supporting the Republican candidate, Marco Rubio.While this may seem troubling to those who support raising the minimum wage, or those who support Bernie Sanders, or both, this could be taken as a good sign. As Hillary Clinton likes to point out, she has faced a major brunt of negative attack ads from Republican SuperPACs. They fact that they are now attacking Sanders means that they are taking him seriously.I m not exactly sure who the ad for is for, though. The claims in the ad are the usual  raising the minimum wage will kill jobs  nonsense that comes from the right. They attack Sanders, saying that he will raise taxes. They fail to mention who would be paying the vast majority of those taxes   billionaires like the ones who created the ad.  Is Future 45 trying to sway voters to vote for Clinton because she will be much softer on Wall St. than Sanders? Or are they just trying to fill conservatives  heads with talking points for the general election?Either way,  both the Fight for 15 movement and Robin Hood Tax movement, which inspired Sanders  plan to put a micro-tax on Wall St. speculation, are two pragmatic progressive ideas whose time has come.Featured image from video screenshot via YouTube",News,"February 17, 2016",2015
 Trump Supporters Threaten To Rape And Murder Elector’s Family If He Doesn’t Vote For Trump,"The Electoral College should tell Donald Trump and his deplorable supporters to go f*ck themselves.The Electoral College convenes on December 19th to cast their votes for president. And it will only take 38 of them to cast their votes against Trump to prevent him from taking office.You see, while we have an election every year consisting of electoral votes and the popular vote, all 538 from all 50 states are constitutionally required to have the final say on who becomes president. As Alexander Hamilton explained in the Federalist Papers, the Electoral College is the last line of defense to choose a person who is  To an eminent degree, endowed with the requisite qualifications  to be President of the United States.And that is why millions of Americans are pleading with the Electoral College to exercise their power and vote against Donald Trump.Of course, Trump supporters are trying to bully and threaten the electors to make sure our country gets destroyed. In fact, an elector in Texas reports that Trump supporters threatened to rape and murder his family if he doesn t vote the way they want him to vote.Christopher Suprun shared the grisly threat with his fellow elector Art Sisneros, who shared the threat with Texas Monthly. You vote for Trump or we rape your wife and daughters with a knife before we kill you,  the threat reads.  Do as told or face consequences. Sisneros explained that he has also been receiving threats from Trump supporters. The Trump supporters and the people on the right thought that I absolutely had to vote for Trump, and to do otherwise was some kind of treasonous act,  he said.Except that Sisneros can vote for whomever he pleases when December 19th rolled around, and that is getting easier to figure out since left-wing groups are reportedly encouraging the electors to choose anyone but Trump, even if it s not Hillary Clinton.Right-wingers and Trump supporters, on the other hand, are being downright scary and are acting like the electors are required to vote for Trump. They were far more aggressive and far more nasty,  Sisneros said.  I received a lot of threats. I just didn t think it would do any good to share them or make a big deal out of them. There were several nasty ones to vote for Trump, or else. Some of them were pretty vague like,  We re going to hunt you down,  that kind of stuff. Some were like,  We re going to find out where you work and come after you. Frankly, threats like these ought to immediately disqualify Trump from office. After all, he and his supporters are the ones threatening the electors with dire consequences. This should really make it easy for the electors to reject Trump outright. He is a danger to our democracy and his cabinet picks are a threat to our government and democratic institution. Trump is even a danger to our continued survival as a free people considering Russia interfered with our election and helped Trump win so Putin can have a puppet in the White House.The Electoral College has a chance to do what they were designed to do and that is making sure that a demagogue and con artist is prevented from holding the highest office in the land. So the electors need to have courage to save our nation. Rejecting Trump is the right thing to do.Featured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"December 15, 2016",3301

BREAKING DISCOVERY: CLINTON FOUNDATION SHARED EMAIL SERVER LOCATION WITH HILLARY’S SECRET SERVER,"The news gets worse every day for the Clinton Crime Syndicate Breitbart News Exclusive: Hillary Clinton s private email server was housed at the same physical location and on the same network as an email server used and operated by the Clinton Foundation, Breitbart News has exclusively learned.Records reveal that Hillary Clinton s private clintonemail.com server shared an IP address with her husband Bill Clinton s email server, presidentclinton.com, and both servers were housed in New York City, not in the basement of the Clintons  Chappaqua, New York home.Web archives show that the Presidentclinton.com Web address was being operated by the Clinton Foundation as of 2009, when Hillary Clinton registered her own clintonemail.com server.Numerous Clinton Foundation employees used the presidentclinton.com server for their own email addresses, which means that they were using email accounts that, if hacked, would have given any hacker complete access to Hillary Clinton s State Department emails, as well.The bombshell revelation raises new concerns about the possible illegality of Hillary Clinton s private email use. The former Secretary of State is under federal investigation for potentially violating the Espionage Act by allowing people without a security clearance to access classified information. The fact that Hillary was sharing an email network with a private foundation means that people without a security clearance almost certainly had physical access to her server while she was working at the State Department.Here s what we know:The Servers Have The SAME IP AddressHillary s clintonemail.com server and the Foundation-run presidentclinton.com email server have exactly the same IP address, and the same SSL certificate (which an organization purchases for an email server to verify its trustworthiness).mail.clintonemail.com and mail.presidentclinton.com both have an IP address of 64.94.172.146, according to an SSL Certificate Checker.The two servers both have that same IP address, 64.94.172.146, according to DNS records. (Here are records for Hillary s server, and here are records for Bill s server).Both servers have the same IP address, according to another independent Internet records database, robtex.net.The fact that both of these email servers have the same IP address means that they were operating on the same network, and sharing physical space. A computer expert tells Breitbart News that the servers were probably operating on the same machine. It is also possible that they were operating on different machines on the same network, which still means that the machines would have to be close enough to exist in the same physical location.President Clinton s server was created in 2002, while Hillary s was created in 2009, which means that Hillary s server was simply added to Bill s Foundation-run server network.They Had The SAME IP Address When She Was Secretary of StateHillary s server and Bill s Foundation-run server also shared a different IP address during her tenure as Secretary of State.From September 8, 2009 until June 24, 2011, Bill Clinton s Foundation-run mail.presidentclinton.com server had an IP address of 24.187.234.187, according to DNS records.Hillary s mail.clintonemail.com server had the same exact IP address, 24.187.234.187, from the dates May 21, 2010 until October 21, 2010, according to DNS records.Their Shared IP Address Can Be Traced to Midtown ManhattanA geographical search for the IP address that both servers shared at registration traces to Midtown Manhattan, according to three different databases: infosniper.net, which locates a Midtown latitude/longitude point, ip-tracker.org, which also gives a Midtown latitude/longitude point, and whatsmyip.org.Clinton Foundation headquarters are currently located at 1271 6th Avenue in Midtown. Bill Clinton s office is at 55 West 125th StreetThe Denver-based firm Platte River Networks told Breitbart News that it physically moved Hillary Clinton s private email server out of the basement of her Chappaqua home in 2013. But the Clintons could have moved the server from Manhattan to Chappaqua before Platte River got there.Clinton Founation Employees Had presidentclinton.com email addressesThe employees who have used presidentclinton.com email addresses included former Bill Clinton right-hand man Doug Band, as well as Justin Cooper, a Hillary aide who has worked with the Foundation, Terry Krinvic, Laura Graham, and John Zimmerebner.Was Chelsea Clinton On The Server?The email server for mail.chelseaoffice.com, which is no longer active, resolves to clintonemail.com, according to DNS records. Wikileaks confirms that the chelseaoffice.com server was used by Chelsea Clinton employees.Hillary Even Admitted That She Used Her Husband s  System Well the system we used was set up for President Clintons office and it had numerous safeguards it was on property guarded by the Secret Service and there were no security breaches, so I think that the use of that server which started with my husband proved to be effective and secure,  Hillary Clinton said in a March 2015 press conference.Clinton has not returned to that talking point since.The Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton s campaign did not return requests for comment by press time.

 Trump’s Own Running Mate Just Put Him To SHAME With A Simple Promise,"In an appearance on NBC s  Meet the Press,  Mike Pence promised to do something that people have clamored for Trump to do for months. It s simple   he plans to release his tax returns. Within the next week. Which is far sooner than anything we can ever expect from The Donald.Of course, despite shaming the hell out of his running mate like this, Pence still had to say that Trump will make good on his promise, too: Donald Trump and I are both going to release our tax returns. I ll release mine in the next week.Donald Trump will be releasing his tax returns at the completion of an audit. What baloney; the audit is an excuse. Trump can release his tax returns despite the audit, he just won t. Richard Nixon, arguably our most dishonest president ever, released his returns under audit. Apparently, though, Trump hiding them and being as opaque as possible is on the advice of an adviser. It s not hard, however, to believe this adviser would tell him,  Don t release any information that makes you look bad in any way.  Yet much of the public is wondering what he s hiding in there, including many in his own party.Both Hillary and her running mate, Tim Kaine, have already released their tax returns, further shaming the Trumpmeister. That s expected, though. One hardly expects one s own running mate to do the same thing.Hillary and Bill Clinton paid an effective tax rate of just over 43 percent. Maybe Trump is worried how much of the world will see how he evades taxes, or that he s lied about being able to get away with paying a very low tax rate. Or both. In that very vein, Trump himself has rather hypocritically said: So you know if you re running, at a minimum, probably you re going to have to show your returns. If you didn t see the tax returns you would think there s almost like something wrong, what s wrong. So what s wrong with the Donald that he won t release his tax returns? He s eating his own words. The fact that his own running mate is willing to do this, while he himself is not, is laughable at best. No doubt they think this will bring some credibility back to their campaign, but it will also make lots of people turn back to Trump and say,  Show us your taxes, now that your own running mate has done it! Of course Pence tried to cover for that, but either he is lying through his teeth and has no intention of releasing his returns next week, or he s about to make Trump look really, really bad.Featured image by Bill Pugliano/Getty Images",News,"September 3, 2016",2478

 Four-Year-Old Bursts Into Tears When She Learns Obama Is Leaving Office (VIDEO),"A few months ago, a story of a young African-American girl went viral on social media. The girl is a first grader named Kameria. She was devastated that President Obama would soon be leaving office and her tears appeared all over social media. Kameria isn t the only one. Another little girl s tears are going viral as she whimpers that she  will miss Obama. Abella Tomlin of Beaverton, Oregon, was in the backseat of her car and her mother was listening to the Democratic National Convention. Obama s the only president this four-year-old has ever known, but this was the first time she had to face the hard reality of term limits.The video starts off with Abella seeming to cry over whatever four-year-olds cry over. She asked her mother Andrea if she could watch a movie to  make (her) feel better.  Then, Andrea asked what was wrong and Abella cried,  I miss Obama. Andrea explained:  Abella has been an Obama fan since day one. She has grown up with him as a hero in our household, and as such has always talked about how much she loves him. I was just listening to the DNC speeches, and she asked me what they were talking about. So I explained to her that the country is getting ready to elect a new president. She immediately had tears running down her face and explained to me that Barack Obama was our president and how could we get a new one when we already had one. Source: Daily MailHere s the video: All is not lost for Abella, though. She thinks Hillary Clinton will be a good president.Andrea told Abella that maybe Obama should know how she feels, and she offered to send the President the video. Hopefully, as with Kameria, Abella will soon get an invitation to the White House.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"August 2, 2016",1735

 Ann Coulter Thinks We Need To Get Rid Of The ‘Utterly Useless’ CIA (AUDIO),"Conservative political analyst (and all around vile human being) Ann Coulter has decided that in the wake of the whole fiasco with Russia interfering in our election, we should just get rid of the Central Intelligence Agency altogether. Poof! Problem solved!During an interview on Sean Hannity s radio show, Coulter was asked about the recent CIA revelations that Russia interfered in our election not just to undermine confidence in U.S. elections, but in an attempt to help Donald Trump win the White House. What do you think of this effort to undermine   first it was the recount, then it was the Russians hacked, even though there s no new evidence at all and the FBI and director of national intelligence disagree. And I know because I ve interviewed a number of these people, electors being harassed to change their votes away from Trump. What do you make of the effort to delegitimize him?  Hannity asked.Coulter s answer was even more jaw-droppingly stupid that what we have come to expect from her.It doesn t make any sense, the FBI disputes it. One of the main proponents of this, of this Russia  I mean, the articles in The New York Times and The Washington Post, they re all anonymous sources from the CIA, an agency we really need to get rid of because it is utterly useless and it eats up a lot of tax money. And this isn t something I m bringing up for the first time now; my loyal readers know I ve been making fun of US intelligence for a good decade now. We have the worst intelligence collecting in the world. Worse than Burkina Faso, it s worse than Walmart s intelligence, because the Democrats decided to destroy the CIA after Watergate.Seriously. This woman thinks that because the CIA called out Russia for their blatant meddling in our election, we should just get rid of the entire agency completely. And, of course, it s all the Democrats  fault. Naturally. The CIA busted Trump s buddy Putin interfering in our presidential election, on Trump s behalf, and this is her response. You really do just have to take a step back and marvel at the mental gymnastics at play here.You can listen to the interview here, via Media Matters: Featured image via Alberto E.

"OUTRAGE AND DESPERATION: VIDEO Captures American Company Telling 1,400 Workers Their Jobs Are Going To Mexico","Our next President is going to have to work with Congress to undo all of the excessive tax burdens, government regulations and restrictions, that have been forcing American businesses to go overseas in order to make a profit and compete Is Donald Trump that President? Video footage has emerged documenting the outrage and desperation of 1,400 American workers as they are informed that their company will be sending their jobs to Mexico.As Mediaite reports:  A cell phone video taken at Carrier Air Conditioner in Indianapolis shows the exact moment that the plant and union workers were told that the company had decided to shift production south of the border.  The best way to stay competitive and protect the business for longterm is to move production from our facility in Indianapolis to Monterrey, Mexico,  says the company representative at the microphone. Let s quiet down,  the company representative says as the American workers of different races and ethnicities begin to shout out after being told that they will soon be out of a job.Although the establishment media seems loath to report it, globalist trade deals and the off-shoring of American jobs have become a central focus of the 2016 race  as earlier this month President Obama s signed what could arguably be one of the impactful trade agreements in modern history, the Trans-Pacific Partnership.The Economic Policy Institute has documented that  Between 1993 (before NAFTA took effect) and 2013, the U.S. trade deficit with Mexico and Canada increased from $17.0 billion to $177.2 billion, displacing more than 850,000 U.S. jobs. More than 5 million U.S. manufacturing jobs were lost between 1997 and 2014, and most of those job losses were due to growing trade deficits with countries that have negotiated trade and investment deals with the United States,  the report states.Mexico is a member country of the TPP. The Economic Policy Institute notes,  the United States already has a large and growing trade deficit with the 11 other countries in the proposed TPP, which reached $265.1 billion in 2014. In contrast, the United States had a small trade surplus with Mexico in 1993, before NAFTA took effect. In other words, outsourcing to the TPP countries is a potentially much greater threat than it was under NAFTA with Mexico. Donald Trump has made his opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership a focal point of his campaign.Trump said that if he were President,I would call up the head of Ford  I would say,  Congratulations. That s the good news. Let me give you the bad news. Every car and every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border, we re going to charge you a 35-percent tax, and that tax is going to be paid simultaneously with the transaction,  and that s it  If it s not me in the position, it s one of these politicians that we re running against  [then] here s what s going to happen. They re not so stupid. They know it s not a good thing, and they may even be upset by it. But then they re going to get a call from the donors or probably from the lobbyist for Ford and say,  You can t do that to Ford, because Ford takes care of me and I take care of you, and you can t do that to Ford.  And guess what? No problem. They re going to build in Mexico. They re going to take away thousands of jobs. It s very bad for us. So under President Trump, here s what would happen: the head of Ford will call me back, I would say within an hour after I told them the bad news  And he ll say,  Please, please, please.  He ll beg for a little while, and I ll say,  No interest.  Then he ll call all sorts of political people, and I ll say,  Sorry, fellas. No interest,  because I don t need anybody s money  I don t need anybody s money.I m using my own money. I m not using the lobbyists. I m not using donors. I don t care.

WHY THE HUGE 1.1 MILLION DROP in Food Stamp Enrollment? [VIDEO],"OVER 1 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE DROPPED OFF OF THE FOOD STAMP LISTS GREAT NEWS!The surprising group that dropped off is illegals Yes, some illegals ARE eligible for food stamps! The USDA has this SNAP FOR NON-CITIZEN GUIDANCEWith the states of Georgia and Alabama leading the way, more than 1.1 million Americans dropped off the food stamp rolls since President Trump took office in January 2017, according to the latest U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) statistics on food stamp enrollment. Participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) dropped to 41,496,255 in May 2017, the most recent data available from the USDA, from 42,691,363 in January 2017 when Trump took office.According to the latest data, SNAP enrollment during the first few months of Trump s presidency decreased by 2.79 percent.Food stamp participation on average in 2017 has dropped to its lowest level since 2010, and the latest numbers show that this trend is continuing.Trump proposed cuts to SNAP in his 2018 budget proposal, suggesting that states match up to 20 percent of federal money allotted for the food stamp program and expand work requirements for able-bodied adults receiving food stamps.Trump s crackdown on illegal immigration has also prompted many immigrants, both legal and illegal, to cancel their food stamps over concerns that they might be denied citizenship or deported.Federal lawmakers are also working on legislation that would seek to expand food stamp work requirements and put time limits on how long those enrolled in the food stamp program can receive benefits.Read more: Breitbart News",Government News,"Aug 8, 2017",1611
WATCH: LITTLE HOUSE ON PRAIRIE ACTRESS Runs For Congress…Thinks It’s Okay For Grown Men To Rape 13 Year Old Girls (If Mom’s Home),"America has proven time and time again that liberals in Hollywood can say just about anything. The vile comments actress Melissa Gilbert made about child rape while hosting The View sound more like something a member of ISIS would make, than someone who is running for Congress. It s interesting how the oh-so-easily-offended Left is never offended when one of their own makes a highly controversial comment, but  if the same remarks were made by a conservative, they would be on a 24/7 news loop. Melissa Gilbert, the actress who brought Laura Ingalls Wilder to life in  Little House on the Prairie,  made some comments on a TV show in 2009 that are coming back to haunt her.And they should. Gilbert moved to Michigan from California and is running for Congress in the 8th District, challenging Rep. Mike Bishop, R-Rochester.But running for office opens the door to past skeletons.As a guest host of  The View  seven years ago, Gilbert and the other hosts discussed the arrest of famous movie director and producer Roman Polanski in Switzerland for drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl three decades earlier. Polanski had pleaded guilty of assaulting Samantha Geimer in 1977, but fled the U.S. before he was sentenced.Hollywood is loyal to its own, and on the show, Gilbert downplayed Polanski s crime, saying that  it s gray area when momma is in the building,  in reference to reports that Geimer s mother was at the house when the rape occurred.Gilbert went on to say that  the punishment at this point may be excessive.

UNIV Of WI Chancellor Contacts Police After Noticing Confederate Flag Displayed On Worker’s Truck On Campus,"Is anyone else concerned that the Left was able to turn the display of a Confederate flag by an American into a criminal offense almost overnight? When a contractor s truck at the University of Wisconsin   LaCrosse sported a Confederate flag across its grille in November, one official was quick to condemn the contractor, call for the flag s removal, and   it turns out   even asked for an informal police investigation into the matter. E-mails obtained by the LaCrosse Tea Party show Paula Knudson, Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs at the school, went farther than previously known in her efforts to get the flag removed and the contractor punished.LaCrosse confederate flagUpon learning of the flag s presence on campus, Knudson e-mailed Doug Pearson, the head of Facilities Planning and Management for the school, to ask that the contractor be told the flag needed to go. The contractor quickly and willingly complied and Knudson went on to e-mail the entire UWL campus   students and faculty   to express her regret over the incident and say that she was  personally. . . offended and. . . very sorry for the fear and angst caused by its presence.  [Emphasis added]At the same time, e-mails reveal, Knudson e-mailed pictures of the truck to interim UW-LaCrosse Police Chief Scott McCullough with the subject line  License please?  After reading Knudson s campus-wide missive, McCullough responded to say he read her e-mail to mean that there was no longer any need for police action since the flag had been removed.McCullough also went on to reference another incident with yet another truck that displayed the Confederate flag and urged Knudson to remember that the police cannot run license plate numbers without a valid excuse to investigate the vehicle.  I would like to take a second and make clear that like the last truck with this emblem, I would need to be conducting a police investigation into some violation (I believe it was harassment last time) before I can run this plate,  he wrote. It could be literally only seconds talking with a complainant but it is an important protection to all of us that even the police cannot simply run records checks for no reason,  he went on to say.  Please don t take this as any hesitation on our part to help just that we have very specific rules that we (the police) need to follow. At least two students who were offended by the flag took action on their own and approached the construction site to express their indignation according to an e-mail from facilities chief Pearson.  The job site superintendent was concerned about two students who walked into the job site and confronted the trucker,  Pearson wrote in an e-mail to Knudson that included UWL Chancellor Joe Gow.  The superintendent indicated they [the students] were rude and were baiting the trucker to say something. I can help resolve these issues, but staff and students should not be walking into a job site without proper personal protective equipment. The following day, Chancellor Gow e-mailed Knudson to chide her for how she handled the situation. He urged her to point out  the trucker kindly complied  with the school s request that the flag be removed.  We need to refute the notion that we have somehow  banned  display of the confederate flag, because we don t have the legal authority to do so. And we wouldn t want to stifle free expression no matter how uncomfortable it might make us feel [emphasis added],  Gow concluded.In public statements made after Media Trackers first broke the news of the incident and published a picture of the truck, Gow said the Confederate flag  clearly is a racist symbol,  but acknowledged that UWL would have allowed the trucker to continue to display it had he refused to remove it.

MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHER BEATEN UNCONSCIOUS BY PARENT AND STUDENT WARNED: ‘I fear for my safety…the children have no respect for adults”,"Don t worry, the attorney for the mom/thug who brought her own special form of street justice to the teacher in the classroom says:  she s a nice person.  Yeah that s what we assumed. A middle school teacher is recovering in hospital in New York after being viciously assaulted by one of her student s mothers and the woman s 14-year-old niece.The incident occurred Wednesday afternoon at Alverta B. Gray Schultz Middle School in Hempstead.Police say the parent, Annika McKenzie, 34, walked into the building without being cleared by security and waited in the hallway for her daughter s math teacher, Catherine Engelhardt. McKenzie believed Engelhardt had  put her hands  on her 12-year-old daughter earlier in the day, according to ABC 7.Engelhardt refused to speak with McKenzie, telling her to first get a security pass.A fight then ensued.Authorities say the teacher was shoved against the wall, placed in a headlock and thrown to the floor.Several students also became involved in the attack, including McKenzie s 14-year-old niece.Another teacher was able to break up the melee and attend to Engelhardt.She was unconscious for several minutes and rushed to Winthrop University Hospital.Engelhardt, a mother and teacher of 20 years, has since been released and is recovering at home  in a lot of pain , according to Newsday.Speaking from her home to ABC 7, Engelhardt said she has long feared for her safety at the school. It s not like I thought a parent would do something, but I knew something violent was going to happen,  she told the network.  I ve warned (the school) time and again that the children have no respect for adults. Yes, I fear for my safety. They can t control the kids. Via: UK Daily Mail",left-news,"Apr 16, 2015",1716

 What Twitter Just Did To Right-Wingers Makes Them Look Even More Like Terrorists (VIDEO),"Right-wing pundits on Fox and Friends this week went on a little tirade about the rules of Twitter and how unfair they are to conservatives. Host Clayton Morris joined National Review writer Katherine Timf in shredding Twitter s  Abusive Behavior Policy,  designed to keep people from bullying others on the internet. The problem the conservatives have with the rule isn t that you could be suspended or banned from Twitter for a few malicious reports   it s that there isn t enough distinction between them and ISIS terrorists.Yes, really. Conservatives are concerned that because the policy doesn t specifically mention ISIS that a bunch of other extremist loudmouths with violent agendas and histories may be targeted and removed from Twitter. They don t argue the point at all from the perspective that there s no reason to compare right-wing American  patriots  to terrorists because to suggest such a thing would be as ludicrous as any claim ever made about anything. Ever.Right-wingers are brash, crass, low-information degenerates. Occasionally you come across a right-winger with an intelligence level worthy of a game of Connect Four, but nothing you d consider the upper middle class to wealthy American they vote to please. They are led by their puppet masters on missions to free the world from the tyrannical rule of Barack Obama, the evils of Islam and atheism, and plain red Christmas cups. They have no argument because the facts the party that rules them feeds them are fabrications and fear tactics.If right-wingers don t like the fact that they have an extremist problem and that their own kind become radicalized and commit unimaginable acts of terror, they should do something about their own message. You can t have people running around vowing to die for their country when their country needs them to just stay home and count their rounds of ammo.Nobody wants that kind of person near them, which extends to our online persona. When a right-winger takes to social media and promises some  libtard  180 grains of Chris Kyle-like justice, they ve just broken the rules and committed a crime, all at the same time.They shouldn t be kicked off of Twitter why? Enough of those people together in groups become what terrorist organizations call  cells.  Here in America, we call them  militias.  Twitter is said to have deleted 44,000 accounts associated with ISIS.

DESPERATE DEMS? RUSSIAN BANK Reports Computer Hacks Designed To Make It Appear Trump Had Secret Relationship With Them,"A Russian bank has reported to U.S. authorities that mysterious communications resumed recently between one of its computers and an email server tied to President Trump s business empire, and it has developed evidence the new activity may be the work of a hacker trying to create a political hoax, Circa has learned.Alfa Bank is asking the U.S. Justice Department for help solving the mystery and pledged its full cooperation.Alfa wants U.S. authorities to help unmask a computer inside the United States that it believes has been used to launch cyberattacks spoofing the appearance of a backdoor communication channel between Moscow and America s 45th president, according to a source directly familiar with the bank s request.The bank believes  these malicious attacks are designed to create the false impression that Alfa Bank has a secretive relationship with the Trump Organization,  the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.Alfa Bank has insisted since media stories began appearing last fall about the computer communications   known as Domain Name Server lookups   that it has never had a relationship to Trump or any of his companies and that any computer connections between the two parties  computers were innocuous. The resumption of the computer pings started last month, and Alfa s cybersecurity experts traced evidence that the activity was actually being spoofed   or hacked  through a third party from a masked computer address inside the United States, the source said.  For entire story: Circa NewsIn November of 2016, The Intercept published a piece refuting a Slate article that attempted to convince readers there was a connection between Trump and the Alfa Bank servers: Slate s Franklin Foer published a story that s been circulating through the dark web and various newsrooms since summertime, an enormous, eyebrow-raising claim that Donald Trump uses a secret server to communicate with Russia. That claim resulted in an explosive night of Twitter confusion and misinformation.The gist of the Slate article is dramatic   incredible, even: Cybersecurity researchers found that the Trump Organization used a secret box configured to communicate exclusively with Alfa Bank, Russia s largest privately-held commercial bank. This is a story that any reporter in our election cycle would drool over, and drool Foer did:The researchers quickly dismissed their initial fear that the logs represented a malware attack. The communication wasn t the work of bots. The irregular pattern of server look-ups actually resembled the pattern of human conversation   conversations that began during office hours in New York and continued during office hours in Moscow. It dawned on the researchers that this wasn t an attack, but a sustained relationship between a server registered to the Trump Organization and two servers registered to an entity called Alfa Bank.These claims are based entirely on  DNS logs,  digital records of when one server looks up how to contact another across the internet. The logs, first gathered by an anonymous researcher going by the moniker  Tea Leaves  (an irony that should be lost on no one) and shared with a small group of academics, were provided to The Intercept and a handful of other news organizations. The New York Times, the Washington Post, Reuters, the Daily Beast, and Vice all examined these materials to at least some extent and did not publish the claims.You can think of DNS like a phone book that maps people s names to their phone numbers. For example, every time Alice wants to call Bob, she first looks up Bob s phone number in the phone book, and then she dials the number into her phone. However, it s possible that Alice might look up Bob s phone number and not call him on the phone. It s even possible that she might look up Bob s phone number over and over on a regular basis, over the course of months, without actually calling him. The DNS look-ups that The Intercept and others (including Slate) reviewed are similar to records of Alice looking up Bob s phone number in the phone book, but to call that evidence of sinister collusion between the two is, politely, a stretch.

 Reporter: How Creepy Donald Trump ‘Hit On’ Me Today (TWEET),"Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump allegedly hit on a journalist on Monday. According to Karen Attiah, deputy digital editor for the Washington Post, Trump told her she was  beautiful  as she asked him a detailed question about his policies on racial inclusion. The incident happened as Trump met with the editorial board of the Washington Post on Monday.So. I got hit on today by Donald Trump.  Karen Attiah (@KarenAttiah) March 21, 2016As the meeting ended and we were walking out of the room, I thanked Trump for taking my question. He turned to me and said,  I really hope I answered your question,  and added casually with a smile,  Beautiful.  I was stunned. I didn t say thank you, and I don t think I smiled. He then walked out to meet with my Post colleagues briefly before heading to the elevator.I stayed in the conference room for a few minutes as it sunk in that the potential GOP nominee for president thought it was okay to comment on my appearance. Did he just say that?The moment made Attiah think about how Trump views the world, noting that, In Trump s world, commenting on a woman s appearance in a professional setting is fair game. She added:At least now I know, firsthand, that the sexism that Trump puts on display against Megyn Kelly under the lights of national TV is not that much different from how he is in real life toward female journalists.Trump has a history of bizarre behavior and language directed towards women.Appearing on the Howard Stern radio show, Trump discussed Latina actress Eva Longoria, telling Stern: She s really cute, I have to tell you, she s really bouncy, really cute. She s about five foot one. Do you like girls that are five foot one? They come up to you know where. He added: You have to get started, you have to like short girls. She s very, very short. You know, she goes out with a basketball player, which is interesting but she s very short. In other clips from his appearances on Stern, Trump could be heard ranking, rating and degrading various women. For instance:In one instance, Trump ranked his top 10 most beautiful women, and while his then-girlfriend Melania Knauss took the top spot, Trump told Stern he definitely would have sex with Mariah Carey, Cindy Crawford, and Princess Diana, who also made the list. In another appearance, Trump assigned each of the actors on ABC s Desperate Housewives a score of 1 to 10 based on their attractiveness. He said of one of the actors, Nicollette Sheridan:  A person who is very flat-chested is very hard to be a 10.  When he got to Marcia Cross, he asked Stern,  Would you go out with Marcia Cross or would you turn gay, Howard? Trump has a problem with women, particularly assertive women in a position of authority. This incident just appears to be more evidence of that.Featured image via Twitter/Flickr",News,"March 21, 2016",2834
 Intel Committee Member: ‘Innocent People Don’t Ask For Immunity’ (VIDEO),"Michael Flynn drove another nail into the coffin of Donald Trump s presidency on Thursday when he agreed to testify about Russia in exchange for immunity. This prompted one member of the House Intelligence Committee to state the obvious:  Innocent people don t ask for immunity. Speaking to MSNBC s Chris Hayes, Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) said what we have all been thinking since the announcement was made that Flynn was willing to testify in exchange for immunity. If you didn t do anything wrong, then you don t need immunity. The only reason to seek immunity is to protect yourself from prosecution from the illegal crap you ve done. Innocent people don t ask for immunity, but that s not something that I m familiar with in our investigation. If he has something to say and he s not worried about what he did, he should just come forward and testify in a public setting,  Swalwell added.Hayes argued that there might be some scenarios where an innocent person would ask for immunity. The MSNBC host said that asking for immunity doesn t automatically mean you are guilty of something. What if they are worried about perjury? Or concerned that maybe their words could somehow be used against them in some other way? Hey, it s possible, right?Swalwell wasn t having it. He said that prosecutors don t run around seeking perjury charges because somebody had a lapse of memory. But this isn t the case when it comes to Flynn, he explained.  What we have here is a pattern of deceit with Michael Flynn. It s not forgetfulness,  the congressman replied.You can watch the entire interview below, via MSNBC:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"March 30, 2017",1642
TAKE THEM OFF OR PAY HUGE FINE! #NFL Won’t Allow Player To Honor 9-11 Victims With Memorial Cleats…Disrespecting Our Flag On 9-11 Is A-Okay,"We re still waiting for the NFL to make a statement about the disrespectful protests by multi-millionaire players who plan to protest an  oppressive  America and the cops who defend the stadiums, keeping fans and players safe while they play football on 9-11 Even as the NFL turns a blind eye to the lengthening list of players protesting America by refusing to stand for the national anthem, the league has decided to crack down on a player who announced his intention to wear cleats to memorialize the vicious terror attacks on September 11, 2001. Now a police union is vowing to pay the player s NFL fine if he ll wear them despite the league s punishment.The NFL has officially banned Tennessee Titans linebacker Avery Williamson from wearing cleats custom made as a memorial to the victims and first responders who fell in the line of duty during that terrible day on 9/11.In response the disappointed Williamson announced that instead of wearing them during Sunday s game with the Minnesota Vikings he would auction them off with the proceeds going to benefit Operation Warrior Wishes.But after hearing of the NFL s denial of Williamson s request to honor the fallen, two police unions stepped forward pledging to pay what would be a $6,000 NFL fine if the player ignored the league s demands and wore them anyway.For his part, the player said he doesn t want to cause anyone any trouble and just wanted to do a nice thing for the country. I don t want to draw negative attention, so I m just going to focus on playing the game,  Williamson said of the ban on the cleats.  Once I heard from them, I didn t even try to argue anything. I just left it alone. I didn t want to press the issue. The shoes Williamson calls his  patriot cleats  are blue with red- and white-striped Nike swooshes featuring the words  Never Forget  and  9/11  on the back. Also a number  11  representing the Twin Towers appear. The shoes were airbrushed by True Blue Customs in Lexington, Kentucky.In its denial the NFL reminded Williamson that all teams must be uniform on the field and no single player may wear unauthorized gear or sport special decorations upon that gear. The ban is usually aimed at keeping unauthorized financial sponsorships from appearing on field.This isn t the first time the NFL has denied a player s request to honor police or first responders, even as other players are permitted to indulge protests against the U.S.A. and support for Black Lives Matter.Only last month the NFL refused to allow the Dallas Cowboys to wear decals on their helmets showing support for the Dallas Police Department, which lost five officers in one terrible attack in July.The  Arm In Arm  decal was to have been worn when the team opened its preseason schedule during a game with the Los Angeles Rams.For entire story: Breitbart News",politics,"Sep 11, 2016",2825
MICHELLE OBAMA Wanted Biden To Run So He Could Beat Hillary [Video],"Has their ever been a more vengeful and hateful First Lady?They are the elite group of women who occupy the East Wing of the White House as their husbands serve as presidents of the United States.Viewed as  the true modern power brokers of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue , the first ladies have had different takes on their public positions and either love the proximity to the country s top policy advisers or view it as serving a prison term of teas, luncheons, dinners and photo ops.There are friendships among this sorority of first ladies and turbulent rivalries as well as  relationships fraught with hurt feelings and resentment, like that between Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama , Kate Andersen Brower writes in her new book, First Women, the Grace and Power of America s Modern First Ladies, published by Harper. The 2008 presidential campaign left deep and lasting scars on both the Clinton and the Obama camps, and they are still shockingly fresh. Michelle, now 52, never forgot how Hillary mocked her husband s message of  hope and change  at a campaign rally in Ohio during that campaign. The sky will open, the light will come down, celestial choirs will be singing, and everyone will know that we should do the right thing, and the world would be perfect,  Clinton said.Watch Hillary starting at the 45 second mark:Hillary was right; that certainly didn t happen and she has remained bitter for years that Senator Ted Kennedy, who had been her mentor in the Senate, did not support her presidential candidacy in 2008.A source in Hillary s inner circle told the author that Hillary, now 68, is running again for president out of vengeance for that loss. She needs to win.Obama is viewed by Hillary s circle of people as not having the same work ethic as Hillary who they see as having a long record of dedicated public service.Those Clinton acolytes also suggest that  Michelle has not done enough as first lady  and has failed to prioritize funding for some programs that subsequently lost their federal support.One such program was Save America s Treasures, a program that Hillary started to help preserve and protect historic sites, arts and published works and was lovingly carried on by Laura Bush, the next first lady.Michelle felt no such obligation to those treasures and let the program dissolve.Michelle s feelings towards Hillary were blatantly obvious when no couple dinners were scheduled at the Obama White House while Hillary was secretary of state and frequently meeting with the President.Michelle is very close to Jill Biden and Vice President Joe Biden. She was hoping that Biden would run against Hillary for the Democratic nomination and his win would take away the sweet taste of victory once again for Hillary.

" Trump Viciously Attacks Reporter For Cornering Him, Denies Telling Comey To Leave Flynn Alone (VIDEO)","Donald Trump is back to shutting down reporters for trying to get to the bottom of his lies and scandals.Earlier today, Trump gave an absolutely disastrous press conference in the wake of his Russia scandal blowing up over the last several days. During the press conference, Peter Baker from The New York Times tried to get Trump s insight into the investigation of Michael Flynn, and Trump basically lost it and had a meltdown. Baker started off by priming Trump: In the light of a very busy news week, a lot of people would like to get to the bottom of a couple of things   give you a chance to go on record here. Trump had somehow avoided any questions about Russia and Flynn until that moment, and everyone was on the edge of their seats waiting for what would come next. Baker continued: Did you at any time urge former FBI director James Comey in any way shape or form to close or to back down the investigation into Michael Flynn? Trump s response was nothing but cowardly, as he interrupted Baker and barely waited for the reporter to finish his sentence. Trump snapped back at Baker: No! No! Next question. Baker then asked Trump if he thinks he s done anything that could be worthy of criminal charges or impeachment.  Trump responded: I think it is totally ridiculous. Everybody thinks so. Obviously, Trump is ignoring the fact that most Americans want him the hell out of the White House, and believe he s guilty. You can watch Trump lash out at Baker below: No, no   next question  says President Trump when asked if he told Comey to stand down in Russia probe. pic.twitter.com/JsIcps4rt7  PBS NewsHour (@NewsHour) May 18, 2017Clearly, Trump has no intention of mending his relationship with the press.Featured image via Mark Wilson / Getty Images",News,"May 18, 2017",1760
About Time! Christian Group Sues Amazon and SPLC for Designation as Hate Group,"All we can say on this one is it s about time someone sued the Southern Poverty Law Center!On Tuesday, D. James Kennedy Ministries (DJKM) filed a lawsuit against the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), the charity navigation organization GuideStar, and Amazon, for defamation, religious discrimination, and trafficking in falsehood. The SPLC listed DJKM as a  hate group,  while GuideStar also categorized it in those terms, and Amazon kept the ministry off of its charity donation program, Amazon Smile. We embarked today on a journey to right a terrible wrong,  Dr. Frank Wright, president and CEO at DJKM, said in a statement Tuesday.  Those who knowingly label Christian ministries as  hate  groups, solely for subscribing to the historic Christian faith, are either woefully uninformed or willfully deceitful. In the case of the Southern Poverty Law Center, our lawsuit alleges the latter. The SPLC has labeled DJKM an  anti-LGBT hate group  for its opposition to same-sex marriage and transgenderism.  These false and illegal characterizations have a chilling effect on the free exercise of religion and on religious free speech for all people of faith,  Wright declared. After having given the SPLC an opportunity to retract, we have undertaken this legal action, seeking a trial by a jury of our peers, to preserve our own rights under the law and to defend the religious free speech rights of all Americans,  the DJKM president concluded.The lawsuit laid out charges against the SPLC, GuideStar, and Amazon.Read more: PJM",left-news,"Aug 27, 2017",1530
"THE NEW SWEDEN: Rapes, Riots, Severed Heads, Freeloading Foreigners And Shocking Acquittals","The consequences of throwing out the welcome mat for people who have no intention of obeying your rules or living in a world with morals or values  Some 30 Muslim men thought that the woman was in violation of Islamic sharia law, by being in Sweden unaccompanied by a man. They thought that she should therefore be raped and her teenage son killed.  Two Swedish citizens were convicted by a Gothenburg Court of joining an Islamist terror group in Syria and murdering two captives. Video evidence showed one victim being beheaded.  Every night when I have gone to bed, I have seen a head hanging in the air.    Court Chairman Ralf G. Larsson.  Sometime during the night, the victim was awakened by the Iraqi as he raped her. The woman managed to break free and locate a train attendant. At first, the woman did not want to call the police.  She felt sorry for him [the rapist]   and was afraid he would be deported back to Iraq. One week after Sweden raised its terror alert level to the highest ever, the police raised another alarm   saying their weapons are simply not good enough to prevent a potential terror attack.November 4: The Swedish Immigration Service sent out a press release, saying that it had hired close to a thousand additional employees since June. The Immigration Service now has over 7,000 employees, including hourly workers and consultants   double the 3,350 employees who worked there in 2012. Most of the new recruits work with the legal processing of asylum applications, but the units dealing with receiving migrants and filing their initial applications have also expanded considerably. As if the record influx of migrants this autumn were not crushing enough, the Immigration Service also had trouble retaining its staff. Employees complain about being badly treated: they are always expected to be on call, and possibly even work Christmas Eve.November 4: Bobel Barqasho, a 31-year-old Syrian, was sentenced by Sweden s Supreme Court to 14 years in prison. Before his case reached the Supreme Court, Barqasho had been sentenced by a lower court to 9 years in prison, then acquitted by the Court of Appeals. In February 2013, Barqasho threw his wife off a sixth-floor balcony. Against all odds, the woman survived the 13-meter (about 43 feet) fall, but was badly injured. When she woke up after five weeks in a coma, her head was held together by a helmet, her face felt loose, and her teeth were gone. In the Court of Appeals, the defense managed to plant reasonable doubt about the man s guilt by claiming the woman was depressed and had jumped of her own free will] so the Court of Appeals set him free. By the time the Supreme Court pronounced its sentence of 14 years, Barqasho had disappeared. He is now being sought by Interpol.November 6: The Gr nkulla School in Alvesta closed after reports of a rape at the facility spread on social media. A Somali boy had apparently been sexually harassing a 12-year-old girl for some time. On October 17, he allegedly took his attentions a step farther, pulled the girl behind a bush and raped her. The girl s father had been unsuccessful in trying to get the school to address the problem earlier, but even after the reported rape, the school s management did not act. The boy was allowed to continue going to the school   just on a schedule different from the girl s. Her distraught parents told the news website Fria Tider:  We are being spat on because we are Swedish.  In protest against the school s management, many parents, viewing the school as having sided with the perpetrator, moved their children to other schools.November 9: Social commentator and whistleblower Merit Wager revealed on her blog that administrators at the Immigration Service had all been ordered to  accept the claim that an applicant is a child, if he does not look as if he is over 40.  A staggering 32,180  unaccompanied refugee children  had arrived during 2015 by December 1   since then another 1,130 have come   and the government finally decided to take action.If its proposition is approved by Parliament, everyone who looks adult-aged will be forced to go through a medical age-determination procedure. One of the reasons Sweden stopped doing these in the first place, was that pediatricians refused to take part in them. They said the procedures were  unreliable. November 10: A 28-year-old Iraqi man was prosecuted for raping a woman on a night train between Finland and Sweden. The man had originally planned to seek asylum in Finland, but had found the living conditions there too harsh. He had therefore taken a train back to Sweden. In a couchette (sleeping car where men and women are together), the rapist and two other asylum seekers met one of the many Swedish women whose hearts go out to  new arrivals.  The woman bought sandwiches for the men; they drank vodka. When two of the men started groping the woman, she told them to stop, yet chose to lie down and go to sleep. Sometime during the night, she was awakened by the Iraqi as he raped her. The woman managed to break free and locate a train attendant. To the attendant s surprise, the woman did not immediately want to press charges. The court documents state:  The train attendant asked if he should call the police. At first, the woman did not want him to do so, because she did not want to put N.N., an asylum seeker, in a tough spot. She felt sorry for him  and was afraid he would be deported back to Iraq. The man was given a sentence of one year in prison, payment of 85,000 kronor (about $10,000) in damages, and deportation   but will be allowed to come back to Sweden after five years.November 10: An Algerian and a Syrian asylum seeker were indicted for raping a Swedish woman in Str ngn s. The men, 39-year-old from Algeria and 31-year-old from Syria, met the woman in a bar one night in August. When the woman left, one of the men followed her, pulled her to the ground, and assaulted her. Afterwards, the woman kept walking, and ran into two other men   the Syrian and another unidentified man   and was raped again. The Syrian reportedly also spit her in face and said,  I m going to f k you, little Swedish girl.  The men, who lived at the same asylum house, denied knowing each other when questioned by the police.The verdict was announced on December 1. Rapist number one was sentenced to 2.5 years in prison, 117,000 kronor (about $14,000) in damages, and deportation to Algeria. Rapist number two was convicted of aggravated rape and sentenced to four years in prison. He cannot be deported, however, because  there are currently hindrances towards enforcing deportations to Syria.  He was also ordered to pay the woman 167,000 kronor (about $20,000) in damages.November 13: A trial began against eight Eritrean men, between the ages of 19 and 26, who according to the District Court,  crudely and ruthlessly  gang-raped a 45-year-old woman. She had been waiting in a stairwell for a friend when the men invited her into an apartment. Inside, she was thrown on the floor, held down, beaten and brutally raped. When questioned by the police, she said,  It felt as if there were hands and fingers everyplace. Fingers penetrated me, vaginally, anally. It hurt very much. I could feel the fingernails.  She said she could also hear the Eritreans laughing and speaking in their own language while they raped her.  They seemed to be enjoying themselves,  she said.When two of the men started fighting over who should rape her next, she tried to flee, but one of the men hit her over the head; she fell unconscious. After coming to, she escaped out a window and was able to reach a neighbor.The District Court of Falun established that several men had taken part in the attack, but the District Attorney was unable to prove who had done what. Therefore, only one man was convicted of aggravated rape, and sentenced to five years in prison. The others were sentenced to only 10 months in prison for helping to conceal a serious criminal offense. After serving their time, the men will be allowed to stay in Sweden.November 14: The Swedish Security Service, S po, warned again of Muslim terrorists hiding among migrants. The number of individuals listed as potential security threats has tripled this year, and includes several hundred who may be ready to carry out  Paris-style  attacks.As the Immigration Service has a huge backlog in trying to register all 150,000 asylum seekers who have come to Sweden so far in 2015, there are probably also many migrants that would be considered potential security threats.November 14: Sweden s Foreign Minister, Margot Wallstr m, made yet another strange statement with diplomatic consequences. The day after the Paris attacks, in an interview with Swedish Public Television, Wallstr m was asked,  How worried are you about the radicalization of young people in Sweden who choose to fight for ISIS?  Wallstr m replied: Yes, of course we have a reason to be worried not only here in Sweden but around the world, because there are so many who are being radicalized. Here again, you come back to situations like that in the Middle East, where not least the Palestinians see that there isn t any future for us [the Palestinians], we either have to accept a desperate situation or resort to violence. Two days later, the Swedish ambassador to Israel, Carl Magnus Nesser, was called to a meeting at the Israeli Foreign Ministry. Its spokesman, Emmanuel Nahshon, later told Reuters,  The Swedish Foreign Minister s statements are appallingly impudent  [She] demonstrates genuine hostility when she points to a connection of any kind between the terror attacks in Paris and the complex situation between Israel and the Palestinians. In a formal statement, the Swedish Foreign Ministry denied that Margot Wallstr m s remark had connected the Paris attacks with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. A Swedish Conservative (Moderaterna) Member of Parliament, Hanif Bali, sarcastically tweeted that it seemed the Foreign Minister is suffering from an  obvious case of Israel-Tourette s. November 18: The Authority for Civil Protection and Contingency Planning (MSB) warned that the asylum situation was not only  very strained,  but that things keep getting worse   and that in some parts of Sweden, the authorities can only function until the end of December. Meanwhile, the Immigration Service calculated that another 13,000 beds are needed in so-called evacuation accommodations.  The problem cannot be fully solved even if the Armed Forces help provide more housing or if the MSB could arrange more tent accommodations,  the authority wrote.The massive influx of asylum seekers has also led to native Swedes  being crowded out of the health care and social services systems,  according to the MSB.  It [the MSB] is so busy handling unaccompanied children and asylum seekers, that there simply is not enough time to tend to the everyday functions, such as healthcare and social services,  said Alexandra Nordlander, Chief of Operative Analysis at the MSB, to the daily tabloid, Aftonbladet.November 19: A fire broke out at Lundsbrunn Spa, a few weeks after plans were announced to convert the historic building into the biggest asylum-seekers  home in Sweden. According to the police, the fire was not an arson, but started in a wood-pellet stove.Many hotels and spas have transforming themselves into asylum-seekers  housing, in order to profit from lucrative deals offered by the Immigration Service. Lundsbrunn Spa, near a mineral spring, dates back to 1890; in 1817, a hospital was established on the grounds. The nearby village is home to fewer than 1,000 people, so when Lundsbrunn Spa decided to accept an offer from the Immigration Service, the village faced a doubling of its population. The owners of Lundsbrunn wrote on the Spa s website that they see the transformation from spa to asylum-seekers  home as a temporary measure.November 20: Norwegian businessman Petter Stordalen, the billionaire owner of Nordic Choice Hotels, announced that the chain s many properties in Scandinavia and the Baltic states would no longer serve their guests sausage and bacon for breakfast. The breakfast buffet of the Nordic Choice s Clarion Hotel Post in Gothenburg was named earlier this year the best hotel breakfast in the world by the British newspaper, The Mirror. But apparently, this award did not matter.The cause for the hotel s decision was cited as  health reasons.  The internet, however, was soon abuzz with speculation that the real reason was adaptation to Islamic dietary laws (halal). One week later, Stordalen backtracked. The reaction from hotel guests had been too strong. Many people vented their anger over the withheld bacon on Stordalen s Facebook page. Stordalen commented:  The guests have spoken. Comfort Hotels are bringing back bacon. November 23: Hassan Mostafa Al-Mandlawi, 32, and Al Amin Sultan, 30, were indicted in the Gothenburg Municipal Court, suspected of having traveled to Syria in 2013 and murdering at least two people there. The charge was terrorist crimes, (alternatively crimes against international law) and murder. Chief Prosecutor Agnetha Hilding Qvarnstr m, of the National Unit for Security Cases, said:  The act [was] committed with the intent to harm the state of Syria and intimidate the people, thus the classification: terrorist crimes. The hard part is to clarify fully whether these men have been part of an armed group, and acted within the frames of the armed conflict, or not. The accused men came to Sweden, one from Iraq and one from Syria, as children, but grew up in Sweden and are Swedish citizens. They traveled to Syria in 2013, and joined one of the many Islamist terror groups there. According to the prosecution, they murdered two captured workers in an industrial area of Aleppo by slitting their throats. The prosecutor wrote that,  Al-Mandlawi and Sultan have both expressed delight at the deeds. During the trial, films of the executions were shown, but both men still denied having committed the crimes. Those present in court agreed that the films were among the most disturbing ever displayed in a Swedish court. First, they show a man having his throat slit, the blood gushing before he dies. Then, the other victim s head is severed from his body, and the killer holds up the severed head to loud cheers from the others. The court s chairman, Ralf G. Larsson, told the news agency, TT:  Every night when I have gone to bed, I have seen a head hanging in the air. The verdict was announced December 14: Both men were convicted of terrorist crimes and sentenced to life in prison. The verdict will be appealed, the defense lawyers said.Via: Gatestone Institute",left-news,"Jan 2, 2016",14709
HOW OBAMA Is Putting Terrorist Boots On The Ground,"Every American should be demanding answers about why Barack Hussein Obama is in such a hurry to empty Gitmo before he leaves office. Illegal alien prisoners are being released at an unprecedented rate. Our borders are being left wide open by a President who s demanded our US Border Agents stand down. Visas are being given to people coming here with the sole intention of harming innocent Americans. Law enforcement has been ridiculed and weakened by a spiteful racist and his willing accomplices in the media. What do we need to do to alert the Kim Kardashian followers our United States of America  is intentionally being destroyed by a radical in the White House?National Security: The Pentagon has cleared the release of 17 more terrorist detainees from Guantanamo Bay prison. President Obama puts jihadist boots on the ground before mobilizing U.S. troops in the Middle East.A congressional aide told Fox News on Thursday that the White House s strategy in the decision this week to set free more terrorist prisoners from the Gitmo facility in U.S.-controlled territory in Cuba is to get the number of detainees there to  as low as they can get,  even if it means  a good deal of risk.  The underlying reason is that closing Gitmo was a major Obama campaign promise in 2008, and he doesn t want to leave office with it still open.But the promise was to close it in 2009. Upon taking office, however, Obama found himself faced with the fact that Gitmo was a rather brilliant idea that the Bush administration came up with to prevent captured terrorists from exploiting the U.S. legal system.The spectacle of U.S. courts setting terrorists free, after trials in which the jihadists  American legal teams might actually get access to and make public sensitive classified information, was not anything for which Obama wanted to be blamed. He seems amenable, however, to his successor having nowhere to hold captured terrorists.Release of the 17 supposedly  low-level  combatants, many of them from Yemen, where war rages, brings the number of Gitmo prisoners down to 90. We were told that  Osama bin Laden s cook,  Ibrahim al-Qosi, released by Obama from Gitmo in 2012, was low-level, but now he cooks up terrorist operations as a celebrity leader of al-Qaida in Yemen.The Pentagon is going along with this politicized emptying of the Guantanamo Bay holding facility. And the decision coming right after an Islamic State-inspired Christmas party attack within the homeland, which slaughtered 14 innocent Americans, suggests the U.S. military leadership has become a group of puppets.A major reason for former Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel s forced departure as Obama s defense secretary last year after a brief tenure, let s not forget, was his hesitation in approving Gitmo releases.In last week s GOP presidential debate, it was a woman who promised that she would  immediately  reverse Obama s emasculation of the Pentagon. Carly Fiorina pledged to  bring back the warrior class   Petraeus, McChrystal, Mattis, Keane, Flynn   every one was retired early because they told President Obama things that he didn t want to hear. Obama calls Gitmo  a sad chapter in American history,  but it was almost comic when the worst complaint Shaker Aamer, released from Gitmo in October after nearly 14 years, could tell of in a British TV interview was  they just suck all your feelings out of you,  adding that  torture is not about beating. Torture is not about hanging from the ceiling with handcuffs and all that     all that  presumably being three square halal meals a day, courtesy of the U.S. taxpayer.Curiously,  The Most Transparent Administration in History  is now imposing new, severe restrictions on journalist access to Guantanamo Bay, with no more visits to the two detention centers where most detainees are housed, and no more interviews of guards and staff. Outgoing U.S. Southern Command chief Marine Gen. John Kelly told AP that the reason was:  We really did have to get some organization to what was going on down there.  After all these years?Under Obama, information on the frequency of prisoners assaulting guards and conducting hunger strikes has stopped being made public.It isn t torture or mistreatment that the Obama administration is hiding from the world s eyes within the walls of Guantanamo Bay; it s that what we have down there is a luxury resort to house terrorists, and that the president is incrementally releasing those soldiers of jihad back onto the battlefield   after America has spent years fattening them up.

"ENABLERS WHO LIVE IN GLASS HOUSES…Why Hillary Embracing Porn Star, Former Beauty Queen Will Backfire","The woman whose husband made several trips to pedophile island with his convicted pedophile friend, billionaire Jeffrey Epstein mocks Trump for  liking to be around beauty contests ? Hillary used what she thought would be a good zinger against Trump during the debate when she boldly stated,  He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around with them.  Really Hillary? Don t you wish your own husband limited his desire for other women to simply enjoying being around them? Think of how many less women you d have to threaten to keep quiet if Bill only looked at other women and didn t actually sexually assault them.Hillary Clinton s new anti-Trump poster child is literally a porn star who was accused of driving the getaway vehicle for a murder attempt and later threatening to kill a judge.But the media is saying Trump is the villain of the piece because he once said she was overweight (despite CNN reporting the same thing).Let that sink in.Hillary brought up Alicia Machado, who won the Miss Universe pageant owned by Trump in 1996, during the debate on Monday night, claiming that Trump once called her  Miss Piggy  because she gained a lot of weight while representing the pageant.The whole stunt was designed to play into Hillary s  feminist  image and portray Trump as anti-women.Donald Trump once called a woman overweight vs Hillary Clinton repeatedly threatening Bill Clinton s sexual abuse victims.Which story is the media interested in and which one won t they touch? No prizes for guessing the correct answer.But that s not even the worst part of it.Machado, who is now a fully signed up Hillary campaign surrogate, was accused of driving a getaway car to aid her boyfriend in a plot to murder his brother-in-law at the funeral of the dead man s wife and then threatening to kill the judge who was in charge of convicting Juan Rodriguez Reggeti.Despite giving conflicting stories on where she was at the time, the judge said there was insufficient evidence to prove she was at the scene of the crime.When CNN s Anderson Cooper confronted Machado with her own sordid past, she didn t try to deny it, simply waving her hand and scoffing,  I have my past, everybody has a past, I m not a saint.

 Watch Chris Christie Awkwardly Squirm In Avoidance Of ANY Trump Questions (VIDEO),"There are moments in life when you have to admit you made mistakes. However, for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, this is not one of those moments. To be blunt, he s having a very bad week. Not only is Christie no longer in the running for the White House, he made the bizarre choice to endorse Donald Trump on the same weekend that Trump wouldn t disavow the Ku Klux Klan. And it even seems as if Trump isn t that thrilled with the support, telling Christie that he should just  go home. Christie claims he s  proud  to support Trump, but his actions at a recent press conference suggest otherwise. He insisted that he only be asked questions that were  on-topic,  and anytime he was asked about Trump he would go off into a rehearsed non-answer to avoid the subject. He said things, such as: No, I won t permit you to. I told you that there s going to be only on-topic questions today. So, permission denied. That s an off-topic question. I think you understand that I m answering on-topic questions today. And then when asked why he wouldn t answer any questions related to Trump, he responded with the maturity level of a four-year-old being asked to eat his peas: Because I don t want to. At this point the New Jersey governor should just go back to his state to take care of business instead of try to hold on to whatever remaining spotlight he can. He should do so not only for his state, but also for his dignity.Christie, back away slowly while you still can and do your job. Both your state and your nation will appreciate it. Not only does your endorsement mean nothing to Trump, it makes you look like, to use your language, an idiot.Watch the awkward moments from the press conference here:Featured image via screen grab",News,"March 1, 2016",1732
 Palin Loses It After Hosts Dare Asks About Son’s Arrest Instead Of Letting Her Shill For Trump (VIDEO),"On the day of the Iowa Caucus, Sarah Palin visited the Today Show to stump for her new best friend, Donald Trump. Unfortunately, Palin seemed under the impression that she was allowed to dictate what the hosts asked her about. Hosts Matt Lauer and Savannah Guthrie weren t having it.Palin, who often claims the media is against her by asking her questions she doesn t know the answers to, got off to a rocky start almost immediately, when the hosts challenged her on several issues that made both Trump and Palin look like raging hypocrites. At one point, a frustrated Palin asked the hosts  Who are we to judge one another s level of Christian faith?    the scalding steam of irony coming from a person who once spent a great deal of time trying to suggest President Obama was a secret Muslim was hot enough to melt steel.But things took a dramatic turn when Guthrie asked about her son Track, who was recently just arrested for beating his girlfriend and threatening to shoot himself in the head with an AR-15. Palin, ever the spindoctor, blamed the ugly incident on wait for it Obama. At a Trump rally, the one time vice presidential candidate claimed Track came back from Iraq messed up because Obama didn t respect the troops enough.When Guthrie asked her to clarify those baffling remarks, Palin became extremely angry. You guys brought me here to talk about Iowa politics and the caucus tonight, not to talk about my kids,  she fired back. And that was a promise. But as things go in the world of media, you guys don t always keep your promises, evidently,  Palin added.Watch @SarahPalinUSA speak out on TODAY in exclusive interview. #IowaTODAY https://t.co/Kbol2A7w9x  TODAY (@TODAYshow) February 1, 2016She went on to claim the media lied when they said she blamed Obama then IMMEDIATELY doubled down. What I have blamed President Obama in doing,  she said, putting her foot slowly in her mouth on live television,  is this level of disrespect for the United States military that is made manifest in gutting budgets and not trying to beef it up and let our military do the job that they are trained to do. To be clear, the  budgets  that Obama has cut have been on the level of wasteful spending on, say, military vehicles that even the Pentagon says it didn t need. On the flipside, Republicans in congress have killed the budget for supporting veterans, like Palin s son, when they come home. Repeatedly, conservative lawmakers have cited  big government  and  out of control spending  to justify slashing funds to Veteran s Affairs and other bills meant to help wounded servicemembers. There is certainly a lack of respect for the soldiers coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan   but it s not coming from the White House.As usual, Palin uses her own victim-complex serve as a security blanket she can hide under when questions get to tough. Palin has repeatedly blamed President Obama for hurting the troops. That s a serious accusation and a fair one for reporters to question. The criticisms themselves may be pathetic, but her refusal to tolerate any pushback on them is even more embarrassing.If Trump had hoped Palin would be a big asset to his campaign, so far it hasn t appeared that way. At almost every appearance, Palin s performance has been a trainwreck. On the TODAY show, she was at least able to string two sentences together without devolving into a hopeless wordsalad, but it s pretty sad that this is considered a victory for her. She still came across looking angry, bitter, and clueless.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"February 1, 2016",3558
WOW! HILLARY’S RAPIST HUSBAND Has To Hold Her Up As She Makes Way To Vehicle After Devastating Debate [VIDEO],"Hillary got her butt kicked last night. Trump pulled out every stop and hammered her on almost every one of her lies.

Hillary can t walk more than 10 feet without looking for an arm, a chair or some prop to hold her up. Bill Clinton, her rapist husband was more than happy to provide her with assistance.

 Trump Supporters Terrorize An American Woman On The Subway For Wearing A Hijab,"Donald Trump s deplorable supporters strike again.18-year-old Yasmin Seweid was born in Brooklyn, New York. So she has been raised in America her entire life. She grew up surrounded by American culture and values religious freedom as guaranteed by the Constitution.And that is why she is able to wear a hijab and practice Islam.But while she was standing on the subway platform waiting to go home, three male Trump supporters targeted her and began harassing her. They called her a  terrorist,  ripped the straps on her bag, and tried to forcibly remove her hijab all while saying Trump s name.The abuse continued on the train and Seweid was forced to exit at an early stop in order to get away from them. Bystanders even watched the incident unfold and cowardly did nothing to stop it.She reported the incident to police, who are investigating the crime.In order to warn others about the dangers of Trump supporters, Seweid chose to write about her horrific experience on Facebook. I take the train every single day going to & coming from class, but yesterday, something happened that I never thought would happen to me,  Seweid wrote.  I was harassed on the subway last night and it was just so dehumanizing I can t speak about it without getting emotional. Three white racists ripped the straps off my bag & attempted to yank my hijab off my head. They yelled such disgusting slurs at me, I was so helpless and felt defenseless.  Look it s a fucking terrorist ,  go back to your country ,  take that rag off your head  and so many more. Trump s name was repeatedly said & it finally clicked in my head. No matter how  cultured  or  Americanized  I am, these people don t see me as an American.It breaks my heart that so many individuals chose to be bystanders while watching me get harassed verbally and physically by these disgusting pigs. Trump America is real and I witnessed it first hand last night! What a traumatizing night. Please stay safe everyone & never let anyone take your rights away. Just thought I should share that with you all tonight.Here s her full post via Facebook.Ever since Election Day, Trump supporters have been celebrating by committing hate crimes against women and minorities. In fact, the number of hate crimes skyrocketed and nearly 900 of them have been committed in the weeks since November 8th. And experts say it is worse than the number of hate crimes committed after the 9/11 attacks.Donald Trump has done nothing more than create an atmosphere of hate and violence in this country. With that being said, his call for unity is complete bullshit. We can t have unity in this country when his own supporters are going around terrorizing people.Featured Image: Steve Pope/Getty Images",News,"December 3, 2016",2723
PROOF THAT TRUMP WAS DEAD ON: NJ Rooftop Parties Watched And Celebrated On 9/11,"Donald Trump was right again! This is yet another example of the media distorting or just not telling the truth. Several news sources have slammed Trump and said he s lying about what happened on 9/11. Not only is this disturbing, but it brings into question so much more about 9/11.American Thinker s Ed Straker gets to the heart of the media s refusal to report on Muslim support for 9/11:Why does any of this matter? The media continue to try to paint Trump as a bigot. This all ties into the refugee question. If we admit more refugees, will some be sympathetic to terrorists? It s easy to get to  yes  if you know, as I do, that some here already support terrorism.Since our refugees come from other countries, not New Jersey, you would think the media would want to examine foreign Muslim support for radical Islam. You would think they would want to see these polls showing alarming percentages of foreign Muslims who support attacks on America. And have a look at this poll, which shows that 5% of Muslim Americans support radical Islam and 14% of American Muslims claim to have  no opinion  of radical Islam. Admitting more Muslims to America during this time of war exposes Americans to large and unwarranted risks.But this is not the question the media want to look at. They are only interested in Muslims in Jersey City, New Jersey. Perhaps they should look into the arrest of this Islamic bomber who lived in Jersey City, or how the Islamic Center of Jersey City promotes jihad, or the arrest of this West New Yorker (that s right next to Jersey City) who was providing support for ISIS.The Washington Post reported on September 18, 2001 one week after the 9/11 Islamic terror attacks, that the law enforcement officers were investigating people in Muslim enclaves of Jersey City, New Jersey who were seen the day of the attacks celebrating and holding rooftop parties to watch the aftermath of the attack on the Twin Towers unfold across the Hudson River in New York City. One of the Post s reporters later stated his sources were eyewitnesses and Jersey City police officers.The issue of Muslims in New Jersey celebrating the attacks was raised recently by leading Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.Excerpt from the Washington Post: The FBI investigation into the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon has led agents back to a familiar area: northern New Jersey. It was there, in Jersey City, just across the Hudson River from Manhattan, that a Muslim cell plotted the 1993 bombing of the twin towers and sought to destroy other New York landmarks as part of an urban guerrilla war against the United States. It is believed that 13 of those detained by federal authorities for questioning in its probe into the worst terrorist act in U.S. history are from northeastern New Jersey, some from the same Journal Square area where suspects in the 1993 bombing lived. In October 1995, Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, an Egyptian cleric who delivered fiery sermons at a run-down mosque in Jersey City, was convicted of directing the conspiracy to blow up the United Nations, an FBI building, and three bridges and tunnels linking New York and New Jersey. He was also convicted of being part of a plot to kill Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Sayyid Nosair of Jersey City and Cliffside Park was also charged in the 1990 killing of Rabbi Meir Kahane in Manhattan. The Kahane murder was the beginning of a series of militant acts by the Muslim cell that was encouraged by Abdel-Rahman, the group s spiritual leader. Jersey City, an urban enclave of 240,055 people that is home to one of the largest Arab populations among U.S. cities In Jersey City, within hours of two jetliners  plowing into the World Trade Center, law enforcement authorities detained and questioned a number of people who were allegedly seen celebrating the attacks and holding tailgate-style parties on rooftops while they watched the devastation on the other side of the river. H/t PowerlineJohn Hindraker at Powerline reported the Post article earlier Sunday and added that one of the reporters on the story, Serge F. Kovaleski, had informed a researcher, Irfan Khawaja, who was looking into whether Muslims in northern New Jersey had celebrated the 9/11 attacks that his sources for the report on Jersey City were Jersey City police officers.Then there is this follow-up from Irfan Khawaja in July 2004:In an email to me on Dec. 16, 2003, Kovaleski indicated that his information had come from the Jersey City Police Department, and that he had confirmed the JCPD s information via interviews of eyewitnesses of the celebration.I don t think Trump saw anyone celebrating in Jersey City on television, but I could be wrong about that. In any event, NPR, the New York Times and the Associated Press are simply wrong when they tell their audiences that there is no evidence of Muslims in America celebrating on September 11, and no contemporaneous news stories to that effect.Why does this happen? Are NPR, the Times and the AP incapable of using Google? Perhaps. But here is another possibility: note that the Times and the AP coyly limited their denials to news accounts of  mass cheering  or  mass celebrations  in Jersey City. I think they found the Washington Post story but preferred not to mention it. Instead, they deceived their readers by silently making the implicit judgment that  a number of people  are not a  mass. I think that these news outlets are so hysterically eager to discredit any concerns about Islam that they won t let something as minor as the facts get in their way. There is dishonesty here, but it is on the part of NPR, the New York Times and the Associated Press, not Donald Trump.Jersey City Longshot From The West: NO HATE HERE MOVE ALONG: ",Government News,"Nov 23, 2015",5778
 Trump Messes Up BIG TIME At Liberty University When He Majorly Flubs Bible Verse (VIDEO),"If there s one quality Republican voters are looking for in a candidate, it s being a Christian. You don t have to know much about foreign policy, or domestic issues, or for that matter, the Constitution, but if you say you re a Christian, well, that s your golden ticket into the hearts of GOP voters everywhere. Knowing this fact, for the past several months Republican frontrunner Donald Trump has been telling people far and wide about how much he s a Christian, how much he loves the Bible, and even that it s his  favorite book. Unfortunately for Trump, his blatant maneuvering to try to convince people that he s a great Christian who follows the Bible is all crumbling down. This was incredibly evident at a campaign event at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia Monday morning.In front of a large crowd of people who actually do know their Bible verses, Trump says: We re going to protect Christianity. I can say that. I don t have to be politically correct Two Corinthians, 3:17, that s the whole ballgame. He then goes on to call Liberty University  Liberty College  and it s clear that he s reading something someone prepared for him to say. Because anyone who s ever gone to church at one point or another in their lives knows that the book of the Bible Trump is referring to is Second Corinthians, not  Two Corinthians.  However, if you re reading it off a piece of paper and you re just trying to pander to your crowd, but don t really know what you re talking about, it s going to read  Two Corinthians. The verse he s referring to is  Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom,  which does indeed sound like the perfect Republican slogan to try to pander to  freedom  loving  Christians  everywhere. However, too bad Trump doesn t actually know what he s talking about.And as fellow candidate Marco Rubio s faith outreach director said, so honestly:""Two"" Corinthians    It won't matter.

OBAMA’S LAWFUL EXTORTION: IRS Levies Major Fine On US Citizen For Not Contributing His “Shared Responsibility”,"According to Ben Miller, he was paying $398 per month for his health insurance policy when he was notified his monthly payment would be increased to $1400 per month. Since Ben chose not to pay the $1400/month health insurance payment, he was fined by the IRS. Here is the copy of his IRS statement showing he owes a staggering $2,344 for not contributing his  shared responsibility. Our records show you have an unpaid shared responsibility payment for the tax year ending December 31, 2014.The law allows us to assess this payment against you for not securing minimal essential health insurance for you and your dependents if applicable.As a result, your balance is $2,344.00.

(VIDEO) MADNESS IN THE STREETS: OVER 100 COPS HURT IN BALTIMORE AS OBAMA’S PLAN FOR CHAOS SPREADS,"Bill O Reilly isn t my favorite and can be belligerently wrong sometimes but this rant is spot on:  The truth is   we don t know what happened to Mr. Gray. The same way we did not know what happened in Ferguson, MO,  O Reilly said, going on to make the point that it is irresponsible for people to make judgments about what happened before all the facts are known. The litany of excuse-making is excruciating. The rioters are angry because America s a country of mass incarceration. People who burn down buildings and loot are just misdirected folks who feel hopeless. And if you feel hopeless, it s okay to riot. You see   it s really not the fault of those who commit crimes. It s the fault of America because we don t provide jobs for everyone. Instead of pinpointing the real problem, and trying to solve it, you get crazy theories that attempt to provide justification for Americans hurting other Americans. If you can t make big money   go ahead and sell heroin. No problem!Here s the truth. How could anyone provide a job that pays adecent salary to someone who can t read or write? To someone who can t speak basic English? To someone who has tattoos all over their body   who s defiant, disrespectful   doesn t even want to work because they have a sense of entitlement that says they re victims and YOU owe me. Does that sound like a good job-seeking resume to you? And don t tell me those folks don t exist. They re legion.So these politicians   out on the street trying to justify rioting by saying that we don t provide jobs   are dishonest in the extreme. If you get educated and are willing to work hard   you can get a job. It may not be the best paying job at first, but you work your way up!

 Senior GOP Senator Says Trump Is Too Stupid To Collude With Russians,"Amid allegations of Russian interference with our elections, Republicans are scrambling, trying to defend the leader of their party. The latest defense, which comes from Lindsey Graham and sort of from Paul Ryan, is that Trump is too stupid to collude with the Russians.After former FBI Director James Comey testified in front of Congress, that yes, Trump did ask him to drop the investigation into former national security advisor Michael Flynn. The best defense House Speaker Paul Ryan could come up with was that Trump is new at this. He simply didn t know it wasn t cool to pressure the head of the FBI. The President s new at this. He s new to government. So, he probably wasn t steeped in the long-running protocols that establish the relationships between DOJ, FBI and White Houses. He s just new to this. Pushed further by CNN, Ryan said,  I m not saying it s an acceptable excuse. It s just my observation. He s new at government, and so therefore I think that he   he is learning as he goes,  Ryan said.Source: CNNTeenagers, try that argument next time you get pulled over while driving. On second thought, don t.Now, Sen. Lindsey Graham has taken that argument a step further and said that Trump is too incompetent to have colluded with the Russians. He doesn t believe he did anything wrong with the Russians and I tend to believe him,  Graham said on CBS  Face the Nation.  He can t collude with his own government. Why do you think he is colluding with the Russians? Source: Think ProgressWhat Graham is ignoring is that the fact that Trump is incompetent is likely what made him the most desirable for Russians. Russian journalist Mikhail Fishman says this about Russian president Vladimir Putin s opinion on Trump:They re quite obviously playing Trump. They consider him a stupid, unstrategic politician. Putin is confident that he can manipulate Trump to his advantage, and he should be.In other words, Trump s a useful idiot to them?Exactly. The Kremlin is limited in their knowledge about what s going on in Washington, but they see the chaos and the confusion in Trump s administration. They see the clumsiness, the inexperience. Naturally, they re working to exploit that.Of course, Graham and Ryan know this and that s what s most dangerous of all. While Trump might be too stupid to know that he is a stooge, the Republican Party s cavalier attitude about the fact that Russia might have installed our incompetent Commander-in-Chief is perhaps the most treasonous part of all of this.",News,"June 11, 2017",2507

PRO-ABORTION BOOK FOR CHILDREN: My “Sister Is a Happy Ghost!”,"Leftist indoctrination for toddlers How I wish this wasn t a true story A three-year-old named Lee defends the abortion of his sister in a new children s book   by an author with her own  ghost sister.   Sister Apple, Sister Pig  by Mary Walling Blackburn focuses on an adult topic: abortion. The story follows Lee as he (or  she,  as the author stressed) searches for his sister   who might be an apple, a pig, or somewhere in a tree. Lee later decides  Sister is a happy ghost!  and explicitly says he s glad Sister isn t around to inconvenience his parents.The free e-book is available on art publishing platform e-flux, The Blaze reported. The author, Walling Blackburn, is assistant professor of art at Southern Methodist University s Meadows School of the Arts and founder of The Anhoek School. Lee is Papa and Mama s only child for now, although there once was a sister,  the book began.  Where does Sister live now? At one point, Lee explained to his Papa,  Well, she used to live in Mama and doesn t anymore.  After Papa agreed, Lee reiterated,  She lived before me, but Mama couldn t keep her. Mama says she is a ghost. When Lee s Papa asked,  [D]oes that make you sad or scared?  Lee changed his tune.  I m not sad that my sister is a ghost! If you kept my sister, you would be tired, and sad, and mad!  When his father questioned why, Lee continued:Because we would be wild and loud and sometimes we would fight. Mama might be scared that she could not buy enough food for us. Mama might not have enough time to read to me, to paint with me, to play with me, to talk with me .Papa also noted  good reasons  Lee doesn t have a sister  right here right now.   Maybe you will have another sister when there is more time, and there is more money,  Papa said.But even during story time, Lee couldn t forget about his lost sibling. He whispered the  secret  to his uncle:  The secret is that she s she s a ghost!  Lee   and his Uncle   pretend she s still there.  The ghost girl can sit beside me,  his uncle offered.Later, Lee told his uncle,  Mama had an abortion before she had me,  but  reassures  him that  Sister is a happy ghost! Even the uncle s friend, Jess,  wonders where the ghost sister is.  Lee replied,  Ghost sister has her own things to do!  but that  [s]he returns when I call her if I need her. And he did, as the last page read,  Mama, Papa, Lee, (and sister) are about to head into the late afternoon  towards home. In the acknowledgements, Walling Blackburn thanked her own  ghost sister  and warned  Masochists, look elsewhere,  because,  between these pages you will not find the  luxury of grief,  culpability s sharp sting or salty guilt.

 Veterans SHRED Trump For Exploiting Navy SEAL’s Death While Press FAWNS All Over Him For It,"Trump s address to a joint session of Congress last night was long on old and tired talking points, and short on substance and concrete plans. Many lawmakers present had invited guests, and, of course, Trump invited his own guests, too, which presidents do. One of his guests was Carryn Owens, wife of slain Navy SEAL Ryan Owens, who was lost during the botched raid in Yemen.The press fawned all over Trump for that, talking about the emotional, touching moment in which Trump actually became presidential. Then there were veterans on social media who felt differently. Many feel that Trump did nothing but exploit Ms. Owens, her grief, and the death of her husband. They were quite clear in how they saw it:       Then there s U.S. Army veteran Charles Clymer, who was so livid he went on a mini-tweetstorm about it:      But here s the press  reaction. The fawning is gag-inducing, especially  from those who routinely speak out against Trump.         That s a stark difference. Trump used Ms. Owens like he always uses people. He was trying to puff himself up, score points, and distract attention from the poorly-planned and executed Yemen raid, which even DHS says yielded no useful intelligence.Our fighting men and women put their lives on the line for us. It would be one thing if the intelligence for the Yemen raid was confirmed to be good, and the raid itself was as carefully planned and executed as it could possibly be. Things go wrong with even the best-planned missions   that s a fact. But that s not what happened in Yemen, and our military members shouldn t have to die for an administration that hastily throws an operation together, and then lies about the result. Owens deserves so much more than this, and his blood is on Trump s hands.Featured image by Jim Lo Scalzo via Getty Images",News,"March 1, 2017",1808
 Trump Threw Mar-A-Lago Fundraiser For Woman At The Center Of Bribery Scandal,"Just a few days after she made the decision to let an investigation of Donald Trump s Trump University slide, the former reality TV star held a fundraiser for Florida attorney general Pam Bondi at his palatial Mar-A-Lago compound.News of the cash-fueled party comes as Trump faces renewed criticism after being fined by the IRS after it came to light that the Trump Foundation illegally funneled money into Bondi s re-election campaign.In March 2014, Donald Trump opened his 126-room Palm Beach resort, Mar-a-Lago, for a $3,000-per-person fundraiser for Pam Bondi. The Florida attorney general, who was facing a tough re-election campaign, had recently decided not to investigate Trump University.Trump did not write a check to the attorney general that night. The previous fall, his personal foundation had given $25,000 to a pro-Bondi PAC. But by hosting her fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago and bringing in some of his own star power, Trump provided Bondi s campaign with a nice financial boost.The Huffington Post also reports that while Trump has billed the RNC $140,000 per event to use his mansion, he only charged the Republican Party of Florida $4,855.65. That means that Trump stands to make a windfall simply by controlling the flow of campaign donor money to his own enterprises.News of the interlocking relationship between Trump and Bondi (she has done campaign rallies for him) underscores how the national media has ignored or played down actual stories of Trump and his involvement with corruption. Instead they have banged the drums on the Clinton Foundation, making allegations of wrong-doing based on the potential and  optics  of the far-reaching charity the Clintons put in place.Trump is also implicated in similar behavior in Texas. The attorney general there dropped looking into Trump University a little after he gave him a financial donation.Featured image via Flickr",News,"September 7, 2016",1887
 Trump’s HHS Secretary Argues That Insurers SHOULD Be Able To Charge Sick People More (VIDEO),"The debate about health care has lead to some pretty ugly comments from the right, but without a doubt, this one is among the most disgusting. Donald Trump s Health and Human Services secretary, Tom Price, recently argued that insurance companies should be allowed to charge sick and elderly people more.According to Price, if we don t let insurance companies charge older, sicker people so much money for coverage that they can t afford it at all and just let them die, then we will find ourselves with any insurance companies period. Well, the fact of the matter is that if we re gonna have any insurers, and the ones that are remaining are saying,  if you con t change this, if you don t stabilize this market, if you don t make it so that we can actually price to the risk of an individual, then we re not gonna be able to stay here at all.' And his answer to this dilemma? To go ahead and allow insurance companies to price sick people completely out of insurance coverage altogether. Now, this may sound like a stupid question, but it s one I have to ask nonetheless. WTF is the point of having insurance at all if you are gonna end up without it when you need it the most? Isn t having insurance to help with the sky-high costs of medical care when you re sick kind of the whole point?Not to mention that this literally means he would rather let people die because they can t afford to see doctors, treatments, and medications so that the insurance companies can save a dollar? It s absolutely disgusting and infuriating. Healthcare is a human right, not just a luxury for the rich.You can watch Trump s health and human services secretary condone allowing insurance companies to price sick people out of health care here:Tom Price: insurers should be able to charge sick people more for coverage.

 WATCH: Republican Strategist Says Something About Trump On CNN That Will Spark His Next Hissy Fit,"Donald Trump will be seriously seething after he sees what GOP strategist Liz Mair called him on CNN.As we all know, the Republican nominee is incapable of keeping his big mouth shut. He always has to whine about something or someone and it hasn t been helping him gain a whole lot of support.For awhile now, Republicans and the media were being pushed around by Trump, but that has now changed as he has had a complete meltdown in recent days in addition to all the things he has said and done since last June when he began campaigning for the nomination.Republican strategist Liz Mair is definitely not a fan of Trump and she is sickened by the fact that Republican leadership didn t have the balls to intervene and stop Trump s rise when they had a chance to say something that could have made a difference. Now the entire party is in jeopardy of imploding.Indeed, Trump s message is the poison that is delivering the final death blow to a once proud party and Mair was only too happy to admit it during an interview with Anderson Cooper on CNN on Wednesday night. His message is being a loudmouthed d*ck, basically. And going out there and offending people and then engaging in an airing of grievances. That s what he does. He doesn t have another message. He doesn t have anything else that he wants to convey. The Republican Party has a message but it s not his message and he has no interest in carrying it. And quite frankly, what I think we re gonna continue to see throughout this campaign is, we re gonna continue to see the Republican nominee basically acting as if he s on a suicide mission and aiming to take the whole rest of the party down with him. Here s the video via YouTube.Mair is absolutely spot on. The only critique here is that the Republican Party s message has been moving in Trump s extremist, bigoted direction for a long time now. Trump is merely taking it to it s final form and all of a sudden Republicans are acting horrified about it. But not so horrified that they aren t still willing to support him. And that s really the key here. Republicans can condemn his comments all they want. It doesn t mean a damn thing if they still support him as their nominee. Republicans created the hateful atmosphere that allowed Trump to rise in the first place. Their only redemption is to make sure he loses in November and just admit they were wrong and that they are going to seriously change their party this time around. And that means they have to stop pandering to the conservative base that desperately wants Trump to win and start transforming into a more inclusive party.Featured Image: Gustavo Caballero/Getty",News,"August 4, 2016",2643
 Trump’s Rhetoric Just Resulted In A Trillion Dollar Economic Loss Worldwide,"If Donald Trump wants to take credit for something he actually did to the economy, now would be the time.Earlier this week, Trump threatened war against North Korea, resulting in a war of words with Kim Jong-Un and escalated threats that culminated in a Friday morning tweet from Trump.Military solutions are now fully in place,locked and loaded,should North Korea act unwisely. Hopefully Kim Jong Un will find another path!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 11, 2017The rhetorical march towards what could end up being a real nuclear war wrecked havoc on global markets, including Wall Street, as stocks plunged. In all, the economic loss added up to $1 trillion, the effects of which will likely hit households in America and around the world hard.According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch,With the tense mood pushing European shares down for a third day and Wall Street set to fall again, global stocks were on course for their worst week since Donald Trump won November s U.S. presidential election. We do just not know what happens next with the North Korea situation,  said BNY Mellon FX strategist Neil Mellor. For quite some time the market hasn t really reacted to things on the Korean Peninsula because we know from the past it is largely North Korean saber-rattling, and it may yet be. But with the rhetoric having gone to a different level, the market just can t afford to take that risk. Many world stock markets have hit record or multi-year highs in recent weeks, leaving them vulnerable to a sell-off, and the tensions over North Korea have proved the trigger.Indeed, Asia Pacific shares just suffered their biggest one-day loss since December. South Korea s KOSPI dropped by nearly a full two percent.In addition,  Australian shares were down 1.3 percent, set for a weekly loss of 0.6 percent and Chinese and Hong Kong bluechips lost 1.6 percent and 1.9 percent respectively. What has changed this time is that the scary threats and war of words between the U.S. and North Korea have intensified to the point that markets can t ignore it,  said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP Capital in Sydney, reports the Post-Dispatch.The Dow Jones has also been falling since Tuesday, the same day Trump threatened North Korea with  fire and fury.  As of Friday, the Dow has shed 300 points.Trump often brags about the stock market even though the record growth began under President Obama. Donald Trump has not enacted a single economic policy since taking office. The stock market had continued setting records thanks to President Obama s handling of the economy and steady leadership. Trump was merely taking credit for Obama s achievement.But now the stock market is falling in America and around the world because of Trump s war rhetoric, which means this trillion dollar loss is all his fault. There is no blaming President Obama for this economic slide. Trump owns this. And more rhetoric or an attack on North Korea will just make things worse.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"August 11, 2017",3023
[VIDEO] LEFTIST CNN ANCHOR TELLS RACIST US REP THE #BaltimoreRiots Are Vets Fault “They come back from war…and they’re ready to do battle”,"Whiskey, Tango, Hotel   Don t worry, Brooke clarified her ludicrous statement by saying:  These veterans are coming back from war and they just don t know their communities.  Yeah okay thanks for clarifying Brooke Radical leftist and open racist, Democrat Rep. Elijah Cummings appears to have the answer however, he s got the DOJ involved in an investigation from  top to bottom  of the Baltimore Police Department. Once their shake-down is complete, the racist crackers will be outed, they ll be fired  and everyone can go back to business. As usual, where s there s a Democrat, there s a taxpayer funded government solution As if it s not hard enough to have to watch racist Democrat, US Rep. Elijah Cummings offer his  expert opinion  on the Baltimore riots/race war he s just giddy about we now have to listen to leftist CNN  reporter  Brooke Baldwin tell us these riots are the fault of our returning US Veterans How much more idiocy can America take? Here s a great example of a courageous US Veteran who stood tall last night in the face of a large group of thugs who were threatening the Baltimore Police with rocks and other projectiles.  Is this who you were referring to Brooke?Here s the original interview with US Rep. Elijah Cummins:After more than a year of CNN pouring gasoline all over America with hysterical, and oftentimes phony, stories of American racism, the left-wing network s afternoon anchor Brooke Baldwin finally took it to the next level by blaming American veterans for the Baltimore riots.In a pathetic suck-up interview with Democrat Congressman Elijah Cummins, Baldwin never once had the moral courage to ask the failed Baltimore City congressman if the left-wing policies ushered in by a half-century of a Democrat monopoly in Baltimore might have something to do with the city s ills. Instead, she said of young military veterans who become police officers,  I love our nation s veterans, but some of them are coming back from war, they don t know the communities, and they are ready to do battle. The context was a discussion about increased training and retraining for the Baltimore police.There s no question Baldwin is hoping to launch a narrative with that smear.This is pure CNN; throwing out anti-science smears towards the best people this country has to offer while it is in reality the rioters who are  doing battle.  It is savages who are looting and burning and causing anarchy, not the police. But it is the Baltimore police who have 15 wounded among their ranks. It is the Baltimore police who calmly did not do much battle during Monday night s riots.Baldwin and CNN just can t help themselves. This is a cable news network that relentlessly launches Hate Campaigns to smear decent people, like Christians, as a way to deflect from the evils done by the Gaystapo and the thugs who are tearing down predominantly black, working class cities like Ferguson and Baltimore.Essentially, what Baldwin said to the world was,  Don t hire veterans! They re too damaged to be trusted with authority.  We re back to the Vietnam-era where leftists smear our heroes to cover up the real problems. CNN wants us to believe unstable veterans are the problem in Baltimore, not unstable families.But she loves veterans.Here s a great follow up interview with Mr. Valentine, the fearless veteran the residents in the city of Baltimore are fortunate enough to have living amongst them:Wine and live television tend to reveal just how ugly some people really are.Via: Breitbart News",left-news,"Apr 28, 2015",3511
POPULAR YOUTUBE PERSONALITY Goes Undercover With Violent Cowardly Antifa Terrorists…”Antifa Women Are The DOMINANT Ones” [VIDEO],"Tim Poole is citizen journalist who s done some really important work exposing Antifa, Black Bloc and the violent non-profit group By Any Means Necessary (BAMN). He sits down with popular Youtube personality Joey Salads who went undercover with Antifa in Berkeley, CA during the riots on April 15th to explore what he found.One of the most interesting observations Salads makes is that the  Women are the dominant ones in the group  and that they  mostly control everything. Considering how many cowardly men are walking around with masks over their faces while they grab one person from the free-speech side into their crowd, so the entire group could brutally beat one person with no interference from the other side, it shouldn t surprise anyone that the women are the aggressors.Salads also points out that the Antifa members  aren t too smart.  They talk about the bike groups he saw and how they use the bikes to wall themselves off. Salads also confirms Antifa members were throwing rocks, bottles and M-80 s into the crowd.Tim Pool frequently calls the Trump supporters the  alt-right  which according to the left (who made up the term to disparage Trump supporters) means that they are  racists . Pool asks Salads if he believed any of the people who Antifa were attacking were  racists ? Salads told him that while he did see a few racists at the event that it was a free-speech rally and that while most of the people were Trump supporters, the rally was about  free-speech  and that the point of free-speech in America is not about whether or not you agree with what the other person saying, but about their right to express their feelings and thoughts.Watch here:Here is Salad s video showing what he saw while he went undercover in Berkeley with Antifa on April 15th:Berkeley middle school teacher Yvette Felarca, a national organizer for militant left-wing activist group By Any Means Necessary (BAMN), is clearly the aggressor in their group.

 Kentucky Republicans Propose Bill To Delay School Year To Accommodate Creationist Museum,"Kentucky Republicans have decided to put the profits of a creationist museum ahead of the education of their state s children, and that just about says it all.At the very start of 2016 s legislative year, Kentucky conservatives introduced a bill, SB-50, that would keep schools closed until the end of August in order to allow the state s brand new  Noah s Ark  museum to eke out a few more weeks of the tourist season. Priorities!Writer Dan Arel has been following the situation, in all its mind-numbing stupidity, for the better part of a year. He writes:As I reported back in August of 2015, Kentucky Sen. Damon Thayer, R-Georgetown, and Sen. Chris Girdler, R-Somerset had proposed such a bill to help extend the vacation season to bring more attention to the forthcoming Ark Encounter. Grant County is set to become a major tourist destination due to the presence of the Ark,  Thayer said.  But there won t be many families from Kentucky visiting in August if we continue with the current calendar. And while other states have set their school schedule around economic issues, you d be hard-pressed to find a state do that to satisfy the bottom-line of a single man.Meet Ken Ham, the right-wing creationist famous for his creation museum and infamous for getting absolutely demolished in a debate with Bill Nye. He and his giant Ark have Kentucky s Republican-led legislature wrapped around his finger.Lately, Ham has been so busy hurling hatred at gay people that one might forget that he makes most of his money by running a religious-based creation museum and associated ministry in Kentucky. In the past few years, Ham has set his sights on expanding his museum to feature a  life-sized  mock up of Noah s Ark. After a ton of fundraising   and a few charges of tax fraud   Ham opened his Ark in November, 2015.To give you an idea of how obnoxious Ham can be, this is how he chose to announce his big Grand Opening ceremony set to begin this summer: We are so excited that the construction progress and schedule landed on this 7/7 date. Genesis 7:7 states that Noah and his family entered the Ark. So it s fitting we allow the public to enter the life-size Ark on 7/7. Ham s enablers in Kentucky want to extend the park s  vacation season  to September. They hope this will bring in more money, but what they don t mention is that almost none of it would be coming back to the state. Ham, for all of his religious-speak, is primarily a huckster. He continues to label his for-profit  ministry  a tax-exempt church, and therefore pays little to no taxes. Keeping kids out of school so their parents can buy tickets for Ham s park does nothing but make students in the state more ignorant, residents poorer, and Ham richer.Schools, obviously, are not happy, either. As Ham continues to count his dollars, teachers and principals are left scrambling for a way to salvage the potentially lost time. One principal was hopeful that the bill wouldn t pass, but conceded if it did, it would be a disaster.  It may help tourism, however, I think it could potentially hurt many Kentucky children. Given the fundamentalism promoted by Ham s anti-intellectual  museums,  it s safe to say the principal is being too generous. This has all the makings of an educational disaster.Feature image via Christian Post screengrab",News,"January 9, 2016",3315
Bundy Case Ruled a Mistrial – Will Federal Case Soon Crumble?,"Mark Anderson  21st Century WireThe Greek philosopher Plato was credited with saying,  Justice in the life and conduct of the State is possible only as first it resides in the hearts and souls of the citizens. Well, since longtime Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, his sons, and his other compatriots have demonstrated they possess a strong sense of principles and justice, perhaps a little justice in the life of the American state is possible which is no small thing in an age of nearly universal tyranny and injustice.This welcome ray of light became apparent in Las Vegas on Dec. 20 when U.S. District Judge Gloria Navarro declared a mistrial in the current high-profile proceedings involving Cliven, his sons Ryan and Ammon, and Ryan Payne.This prompted members of the Bundy family and dozens of their supporters to leave the courthouse on that Tuesday in a state of elation, even with the presence of protesters who, holding signs that read,  Keep your Bundy hands off public lands,  appeared to be paid agitators for billionaire leftist revolutionary George Soros, as one protestor basically admitted.Back in the spring of 2014, the above-named four defendants who ve become emblematic of the plight of Western ranchers resisting heavy-handed federal land controls were accompanied by other Bundy siblings, and by scores of supporters from across the nation, all of whom gathered near Cliven s ranch in Clark County, in southern Nevada, to exercise their First and Second Amendment rights.On that basis, these brave souls, some of whom were armed in an open-carry state, protested the actions of well-armed Bureau of Land Management agents, FBI agents (including SWAT units) and contractors, when these officials showed up, set up shop, and finally moved to impound Cliven s cattle over flimsy allegations of unpaid grazing fees on public lands. The impoundment attempt, on April 12, 2014, was unsuccessful, however.But while the government retreated that day after a lengthy and often tense standoff, a 16-count federal indictment was eventually handed down. Cliven, Ammon and the two Ryans were among nearly 20 initially indicted in this now-legendary federal case, which hasn t gone particularly well for prosecutors ever since the first of several planned trials started in February of 2017.Thus, the government, despite spending millions of dollars, has seen its case steadily deflate to the point where, as of now, the only things that remain, according to a legal observer, are for Judge Navarro to receive briefs from the prosecution and the defense by 5 p.m. Dec. 29 (when a hearing may take place). Those briefs will consist of arguments to enable the judge to decide whether or not to fully dismiss the case.The mistrial happened around 9:30 a.m. Pacific Time Dec. 20, as  Navarro told the jury to  go home . . . it s over,  recounted Roger Roots, a legal expert and author who has observed virtually every trial proceeding firsthand.He said that after Judge Navarro reviews the briefs, an open hearing will be convened at 9 a.m. on Jan. 8, according to the court schedule as of this writing. If she rules for dismissal Jan. 8  without prejudice,  the indictment remains in force and federal prosecutors technically could reset the trial of Cliven and the three others, reportedly on or around Feb. 26. But if she rules for dismissal  with prejudice,  then the indictment is dissolved, according to Roots.Roots said a dissolved indictment would mean the government would have to go to the trouble and expense of convening a new grand jury in order to seek a new indictment which would be  double jeopardy  and therefore a probable constitutional violation.And while Roots said the government conceivably could appeal the mistrial ruling to the Ninth Circuit, at this point he does not believe the government would jump through all the necessary hoops for a new indictment.Notably, what helped make the mistrial a reality was Navarro s findings (reached during hearings on exculpatory evidence that the government has been withholding) that the prosecution had committed several Brady v Maryland violations including not disclosing to the defense the existence of surveillance cameras, including those trained at the Bundy homestead.Also included is not disclosing the fact that concealed snipers were stationed around the area at the time of the 2014 standoff; not disclosing the existence of maps of the snipers  positions; and, among other things, not disclosing threat-assessment reports which include government admissions that Cliven and company are not dangerous people.SEE ALSO: Nevada Residents:  Public Land Belongs to the People, Not DC Notably, family patriarch Cliven, as a matter of principle, stayed in prison despite a recent hearing in which the court allowed him to leave jail under house arrest. He has been jailed since early 2016 and has suffered from health problems.Cliven based his decision on the fact that a few remaining defendants which had included his sons Mel and Dave until they, too, were granted house arrest are still in jail awaiting a final trial that s been scheduled to take place sometime next year. Moreover, Ryan and Ammon Bundy, as well as Ryan Payne, all were recently released under house-arrest rulings, after an equally grueling amount of time behind bars.During a recent on-the-air interview, Cliven s daughter-in-law Briana, who s Mel s wife, told Free Speech Zone host Jim Lambley of KSDZ-FM  The Twister  out of Nebraska that in the almost two years that Cliven has been behind bars, several more grandchildren of his were born. Yet Cliven, despite such a strong emotional attachment to his large family, still chose to remain in jail to honor the others still imprisoned.On a Dec. 20 appearance on the same radio show, Briana added,  Over 3,300 hundred pages of evidence that could ve helped the defense have been withheld and have been turned over to the defense in the last two weeks . . . . It was absolutely intentional and she [Judge Navarro] said she believes it was intentional because of what they withheld. Briana, who understands that even one, let alone several Brady violations, normally would be expected to lead to a full dismissal of the case right away (rather than carrying on with more hearings) added, however, that the Bundy siblings all are wearing electronic ankle bracelets and cannot leave their house-arrest locations before 7 a.m. and must return by 7 p.m., even while they are prohibited from congregating during Christmastime. But we re still winning here,  Briana went on to tell KSDZ host Jim Lambley, while adding that even though a dismissal was hoped-for, rather than a mistrial, the upside is that any further proceedings will provide an opportunity to expose even more evidence that the government has withheld.Lambley replied:  The government is just digging a deeper hole for themselves; the government is the false accuser here, that s all there is to it. Mr. Roots, who s cautiously optimistic about the remainder of this case, said that given the mistrial ruling, the few defendants still behind bars have a dramatically improved chance of never going to trial. Cliven won t go home until this case is all the way over,  Roots remarked, moved by Cliven s ironclad principles.This article was originally published at The Truth HoundREAD MORE BUNDY RANCH NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Bundy Ranch FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE   SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",US_News,"December 21, 2017",7456

OBAMA COZIES UP TO ANOTHER COMMUNIST LEADER TO DISCUSS HUMAN RIGHTS… AND TPP?,"So much for the US refusing to work with countries who are guilty of some of the worst human rights violations in the world From Human Rights Watch: Vietnam s human rights record remains dire in all key areas. A one-party communist state suppresses virtually all forms of political dissent, using a broad array of repressive measures. Freedom of expression, association and assembly are tightly controlled. The police routinely use torture and beatings to extract confessions and punish detainees. Religious minorities and activists are harassed, intimidated and imprisoned. The criminal justice system lacks independence and operates under the direction of the government and party. State-run drug rehabilitation centers exploit detainees as forced laborers making goods for local markets and export. Despite the pressure, increasing numbers of courageous bloggers and activists are vocal in calling for democracy and greater freedoms.A coalition of 14 human rights groups strongly condemns the Feb. 2014 decision by an appeals court upholding a 30-month prison sentence for Vietnamese human rights lawyer and blogger Le Quoc Quan. Mr. Quan has been detained since December 2012.The groups believe Mr. Quan s detention is politically motivated and a reaction to his blog, where he frequently exposes human rights violations by the Vietnamese government. Mr. Quan is a victim of a coordinated government crackdown on bloggers, citizen journalists and pro-democracy activists.Meanwhile President Barack Obama met Tuesday with Vietnamese communist party leader Nguy n Ph  Tr ng in the hopes of strengthening ties between the two nations. The President also welcomes the opportunity to discuss other issues, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership, human rights, and bilateral defense cooperation,  the White House said in a statement.The meeting came nearly four decades after the Vietnam War. Since that time, the two countries have made efforts to improve diplomatic relations. In just the past two years, Obama has met with Vietnam s President Tr ng T n Sang and Prime Minister Nguy n T n D ng. Like in any relations between two countries in the world, Vietnam and the U.S. have differences on a number of issues, such as perception on democracy, human rights and trade,  Tr ng wrote, according to NPR.  To resolve differences, I believe the most effective way would be open and constructive dialogues. Via: Daily Caller",politics,"Jul 7, 2015",2421
UN Physically Removes Independent Media From NYC HQ For Exposing Institutional Corruption,"21st Century Wire says For years, the United Nations seems to have been embroiled in an endless string of scandals and cover-ups, and yet rarely, if ever, has anyone ever actually been held to account. This has led a number of pundits to accuse the institution of being  above the law  and riddled with institutional corruption.This latest story only reaffirms these accusations Independent journalist Matthew Russell Lee (photo, left) founded Bronx-based Inner City Press in 2005 and received official press accreditation to cover the United Nations in New York City. He was the first-ever independent, non-affiliated blogger to be given access to the UN s inner sanctum. Since then Inner City Press has broken stories on a number of controversial stories: peacekeeper rapes in Africa, UN cholera in Haiti, war crimes in Sri Lanka and Burundi, the Sudans, SEMG and Yemen (see a leaked letter here), as well as corruption within UN Headquarters (cocaine shipments through its mail room and the current bribery scandals).Apparently, it was all too much for diplomatic luminaries at the UN. Last month, Lee was forcibly ejected from the UN headquarters.The DC-based Government Accountability Project, which defends UN and other whistleblowers, believes that the ouster of Inner City Press from the UN s press office is  retaliatory in response to independent, critical journalism. UN Restricts of Free PressOn the afternoon of February 19th, Inner City Press questioned UN inaction in South Sudan and Burundi and financial irregularities, and was handed a letter from Ban Ki-moon s Under Secretary General for Public Information Cristina Gallach ordering Inner City Press to surrender its Resident Correspondent accreditation of eight years and be removed from the UN by 5 pm. In a letter that gave Inner City Press only two hours notice, Gallach told Inner City Press to surrender the key to its long-time shared office. Read the UN letter here. Later, while Inner City Press was writing up a UN Security Council meeting on Syria that went into the evening, a total of eight UN Security guards under Deputy Chief Michael McNulty tore off Inner City Press  UN ID badge and grabbed Inner City Press  laptop and camera, before throwing them on the sidewalk on First Avenue as well as physically throwing journalist Matthew Lee on the street in freezing weather, without a coat. Audio here; video as UN Security turns off Inner City Press  Periscope livestream here:  Ban Ki-moon, whose  victory tour  of blood-soaked northern Sri Lanka Inner City Press covered and was never forgiven for by Ban s UN, was the target of a demonstration in Jaffa for the ouster of Inner City Press. Tamils in Jaffna protest the cancellation of the resident correspondent s press accreditation of Inner City Press from the UN Building in New York City: Supporters of Inner City Press launched a petition to restore Lee and Inner City Press to its former office space.READ MORE UN NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire UN Files",US_News,"March 6, 2016",2991
"COWARDLY CHAIN MIGRATION TERRORIST Who Entered US During Obama’s Second Term, Mocked President Trump Just Before Failing To Blow Himself Up","Yesterday, a cowardly recipient of America s generosity, via a broken chain migration policy, walked through the busy subway terminal near the Port Authority Transit hub, where he planned to use a homemade bomb strapped to his body as a weapon to  terrorize as many people as possible.  The chain migration terrorist claims he chose the Port Authority site because the poor little radicalized Muslim who America welcomed with open arms, was triggered by the Christmas posters that hung in the hallways of the terminal. The chain migration terrorist, who was inspired by ISIS, failed miserably.The media will show their true colors when they ignore the ease with which radical Muslims from hotbed terror nations have been allowed to enter the United States, and will instead, will focus on Ullah s statement about wanting to punish President Trump for recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The media will also ignore the fact that we wouldn t even be having this conversation if Ullah was not allowed to enter the United States during Obama s presidency. It was actually during Barack Hussein Obama s second term in 2014, that Ullah began to explore ways to commit acts of terror against Americans, as a way to show his allegiance to the cowardly terror group, ISIS. (See paragraph  f. )Port Authority bomber Akayed Ullah wanted to send a message straight to the White House:  Trump you failed to protect your nation. Here is a screenshot of the complaint filed by Assistant United States Attorneys:That s what the 27-year-old ISIS adherent wrote on his Facebook page while on his way to blow himself up at the bustling transit hub Monday morning, according to the federal complaint filed Tuesday.He had also written in his passport:  O AMERICA, DIE IN YOUR RAGE. The charges also reveal that the 27-year-old Bangeldesh-born cabbie s online radicalization began in 2014, and he began researching how to build bombs a year ago   although he only constructed his crude explosive device at his Brooklyn home a week ago.Ullah built the bomb for  maximum damage,  federal prosecutors charge   filling it with metal screws   and performed the bombing on a workday because  he believed that there would be more people.

Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly was repeatedly cut off by Senator Kamala Harris (D., Calif.) during questioning about the administration s sanctuary city policy. Harris cut Kelly off to say the administration was forcing cities into choosing between complying with federal law or forfeiting DHS counterterrorism funds. Had you not cut me off, I would have said the same thing you just said. Probably not as eloquently, but I would have said the same thing you just said,  Kelly said.Later, Kelly said he told city officials that whatever they do within the law,  we re willing to work with them. So So are you aware that there s local law enforcement  Harris started. Could you at least let me finish once, before you interrupt me?  Kelly said. Sir, with all due respect,  Harris responded. With all due respect, senator,  Kelly said.Harris asked Kelly if the administration was advising local enforcement leaders that they could overlook government requests on detainment to avoid liability. We talk to them about whatever they re comfortable with, whatever they think they can do within interpretation of their local attorneys general, as an example, or local lawyers  Kelly said.Harris interrupted again, and Kelly became irritated. So when they re instructed  Harris started. Could you let me finish once, senator?  Kelly asked angrily. Excuse me. I m asking the questions,  Harris said.

 Bizarre Late Night Statement Proves Deputy AG Is Just Another Water Carrier For Trump,"Donald Trump s administration and White House is the leakiest in living memory. This is because even his own staff knows that he is incompetent, intemperate, childish, narcissistic, and completely unfit for the office he holds. Despite the fact that they all know this, the sycophants around him just keep on doing his bidding   and they keep leaking. These leaks seem to be worrying Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein   or rather, likely Trump s open rage with regards to them has forced Rosenstein s hand.Instead of defending the integrity of Special Counsel Robert Mueller as Trump and his minions have spent the last few days attacking this decorated public servant, Rosenstein instead decided to issue a bizarre statement late Thursday night that shows that he, too, is now shilling for Trump. The statement attacks the credibility of anonymous sources, saying:Americans should exercise caution before accepting as true any stories attributed to anonymous  officials,  particularly when they do not identify the country   let alone the branch of agency of government   with which the alleged sources supposedly are affiliated. Americans should be skeptical about anonymous allegations. The Department of Justice has a long established policy to neither confirm nor deny such allegations.Fired U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara pointed out that Rosenstein should be defending Special Counsel Mueller instead of shilling for Trump:Where is Rod Rosenstein's overdue statement responding to the President's repeated attacks on his appointment of Robert Mueller? pic.twitter.com/y7dwtWTQ4G  Preet Bharara (@PreetBharara) June 16, 2017This is beyond strange. The Department of Justice is not supposed to be politicized, but still the people therein serve at the pleasure of the president. More than likely, Trump ordered Rosenstein to do this, since so many damning stories about the Russia investigation are coming out on an almost hourly basis. Trump is reportedly completely obsessed with the Russia story, and still hasn t let go of the idea of somehow getting rid of Special Counsel Robert Mueller. In fact, the only reason Mueller is still there is because White House aides talked Trump off the ledge when he was about to order his firing.Conservative commentator Bill Kristol has an excellent theory as to what is going on with Rosenstein s behavior, and it s terrible for the nation:The Rosenstein statement suggests there must be a heck of a Trump story coming based on alleged information from anonymous foreign officials  Bill Kristol (@BillKristol) June 16, 2017In the Age of Trump, the independence of the Department of Justice is definitely shot, and this proves it. While it was clear that Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who was a part of Trump s campaign and one of his staunchest supporters was nothing but a Trump shill, we had all hoped that Sessions  recusal from the Russia investigation and Rosenstein s taking over would give the whole situation a bit more credibility, but no.All I can say is thank goodness for Robert Mueller. Hopefully, firing him would be a bridge too far   even for Congressional Republicans.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"June 16, 2017",3184
"WATCH OBAMA Admit To Rigged Elections In 2008: “Whenever people are in power, they have this tendency to try to tilt things in their direction.” [Video]","Obama is a scoundrel he ll say anything to stay in power. He s counting on the American people to believe his total bs story about election fraud when in 2008 he spoke of fraud. It s pretty funny that now he s claiming Trump s remarks are  dangerous  when he said the same thing in 2008! When you suggest rigging or fraud without a shred of evidence    Barack ObamaPlease be a poll challenger this year! We ve done it several times and we feel it s the only way we can combat voter fraud head on. Just contact your local Republican party office. Please consider this!At a campaign rally for Hillary Clinton on Thursday in Miami Gardens, Fla., President Obama condemned Donald Trump s  rigged election  claims, describing these remarks as  dangerous. When you try to sow the seeds of doubt in people s minds about the legitimacy of our election, that undermines our democracy,  he said. When you suggest rigging or fraud without a shred of evidence, when last night at the debate, Trump becomes the first major party nominee in American history to suggest that he will not concede despite losing that is not a joking matter,  Obama added.Trump said at the third presidential debate that he would keep the United States  in suspense  as to whether he would accept the election results. Later, at a campaign rally, he promised in a jesting manner that he would accept the results  if I win  as the crowd roared.But despite condemning Trump for suggesting an election can be rigged, here is a clip of then-candidate Barack Obama in 2008 warning about voter fraud and suggesting Republicans could try to sway the election in their favor. Well, I tell you what it helps in Ohio, that we got Democrats in charge of the machines,  Obama said regarding the threat of election-rigging.He continued,  Whenever people are in power, they have this tendency to try to tilt things in their direction. That s why we ve got to have, I believe, a voting rights division in the Justice Department that is nonpartisan, and that is serious about investigating cases of voter fraud. That s why we need paper trails on these new electronic machines so that you actually have something that you can hang on to after you ve punched that letter make sure it hasn t been hacked into,  he added, admitting that even Democrats have  monkeyed around  with election results: I want to be honest, it s not as if it s just Republicans who have monkeyed around with elections in the past.

OOPS! ABSOLUTELY NO ONE SHOWED UP For NYC Debut Of Beyonce’s Clothing Line…Is Her RADICAL Super Bowl Performance To Blame?,"I was in Nordstrom yesterday when our salesperson asked my teenage daughter and I if we had seen the new  Ivy Park  collection by Beyonce yet? My response to her was  no,  as I turned to my daughter and told her I wouldn t buy anything for her from that collection if it was the only thing Nordstrom sold. It wasn t that long ago I watched Beyonce dressed in her Black Panther inspired costume, performing a hateful, cop bashing song during Super Bowl 2016 (Watch HERE). I haven t forgotten and it s not likely I ll forget anytime soon.  People who love our country and are tired of seeing it being divided into categories of race and sexual orientation need to stand up to these race peddlers and hit them where it hurts in their bank accounts. Beyonce s radical, racist husband is making money hand over fist from people of all races, yet he s dumped over $1.5 million into groups and organizations specifically designed to divide our nation and instill hatred towards our law enforcement officers.  Cosmopolitan Since it was announced, people have been dying over the launch of Beyonc s highly anticipated womenswear athleisure line for Toyshop, Ivy Park. The collection, which hit stores today, is the type of collaboration that people wait hours in line for, trample each other for   you get the picture.My mouth dropped when I showed up for the launch of Ivy Park at Topshop s Soho location in New York. There was not a single person in line.No camping out overnight, no eager shoppers. It was so quiet I could hear the birds chirping. All I saw were people walking their dogs and grabbing their morning coffees. Where was the Beyhive? I couldn t have been the only one who cared. Because Beyonc .The doors were set to open at 10 a.m.Here was the scene an hour before the launch They were shocked by the low turnout too. I woke up and saw the hashtag and could see that London had crazy lines, so I felt like I had to rush to get down to the store,  said one shopper, Krystal.  Why are people not here? It s Beyonc . I don t understand. Her much hyped debut sportswear line launched at Topshop in London on Wednesday but Beyonce was no where to be seen.It is the pop star s first collection for Topshop so her no-show was a something of mystery considering the enormous hype surrounding the launch.Retail magnate Sir Philip Green, who owns Topshop among a number of other High St brands, said Beyonce was very involved in the collaboration. She saw every single piece on (and) was very involved in the development. My girls loved working with her and it really worked very well,  the clothing mogul told USA Today.Her no-show, however, speaks volumes.

 The Obamas Gave A Heartbreaking Tribute To Muhammad Ali (VIDEO),"The last couple of years have been rampant with what seems like premature deaths. Would we have ever been able to prepare ourselves for the deaths of Robin Williams, David Bowie, Prince and so many, many more people? Unfortunately, we have another name to add to what seems like a particularly grim year: Muhammad Ali   and the Obamas, in a statement to America,  mourned the loss as deeply as any of us.To the Obamas, Ali   who was resoundingly loved and admired, and was actually (unlike President Obama) a black Muslim   was  The Greatest. Period. Like everyone else on the planet, Michelle and I mourn his passing. But we re also grateful to God for how fortunate we are to have known him, if just for a while; for how fortunate we all are that The Greatest chose to grace our time, Muhammad Ali was The Greatest. Period. If you just asked him, he d tell you. He d tell you he was the double greatest; that he d  handcuffed lightning, thrown thunder into jail,  Obama wrote.  But what made The Champ the greatest   what truly separated him from everyone else   is that everyone else would tell you pretty much the same thing. The President also tweeted, showing himself working with a picture of the Champ behind him.He shook up the world, and the world s better for it. Rest in peace, Champ. pic.twitter.com/z1yM3sSLH3  President Obama (@POTUS) June 4, 2016Obama also noted that he has a pair of Ali s boxing gloves in his private study.Obama continued,  I am America,  he once declared.  I am the part you won t recognize. But get used to me   black, confident, cocky; my name, not yours; my religion, not yours; my goals, my own. Get used to me.  That s the Ali I came to know as I came of age   not just as skilled a poet on the mic as he was a fighter in the ring, but a man who fought for what was right. A man who fought for us. He stood with King and Mandela; stood up when it was hard; spoke out when others wouldn t. His fight outside the ring would cost him his title and his public standing. It would earn him enemies on the left and the right, make him reviled, and nearly send him to jail. But Ali stood his ground. And his victory helped us get used to the America we recognize today. Muhammad Ali shook up the world,  Obama concluded in his tribute to Ali.  And the world is better for it. We are all better for it. Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to his family, and we pray that the greatest fighter of them all finally rests in peace. Source: Rolling StoneHere s a video:While Obama was born during the height of the Civil Rights Movement, he came of age watching Ali. To Obama, Martin Luther King and even Malcolm X were parts of history books, but Ali was brash, confident, smart, socially aware and a force to be reckoned with in the 60s and 70s. While so many Civil Rights leaders were working behind the scenes, or perhaps in front, but more quietly, Ali told the world that he could do anything, no matter his skin color. Perhaps there would have never been a President Barack Obama if it weren t for the example put forth by Muhammad Ali.Featured image via Kent Gavin at Getty Images.",News,"June 5, 2016",3125
" 40,000 MA Drug Cases Could Be Thrown Out Because Of Drug Stealing Lab Scandal","A Massachusetts crime lab scandal could result in tens of thousands of criminal convictions being overturned. It s not the first time this has happened in the state either.As Addicting Info reported in May of last year, up to 60,000 drug cases were impacted by a scandal that rocked the Hinton Drug Lab, located in Boston, MA.In that case, a chemist by the name of Annie Dookhan plead guilty to 27 criminal charges, including  tampering with evidence, violating the state witness intimidation statute, multiple counts of lying to a grand jury, falsely claiming to carry a degree and others. Over a 14 year period, Dookhan forged documents, testified falsely in criminal cases and tampered with test results while employed as a chemist at the state crime lab.After Dookhan s confession thousands of convictions were overturned and hundreds of cases, which were still pending, were dismissed.The state of MA conducted a 15-month-long investigation into the crime lab, finding  a pattern of neglect, mismanagement, and poor standards. In spite of the state s findings, no other employees faced criminal charges. The Hinton lab was eventually closed down.Now another MA drug lab is facing a massive backlash, after court documents revealed a separate scandal involving drug use, evidence tampering and a series of other crimes earlier this week.As the Boston Herald reports, Amherst state lab chemist Sonja Farak was convicted in 2014 of tampering with evidence, theft and drug use inside the crime lab, where she was employed for more than eight years.At the height of her criminal activity, Farak was smoking crack ten to twelve times a day inside the crime lab, as well as using a host of other drugs which she obtained through the lab.Farak confessed to using the drugs at her work station, where she also tested samples submitted by law enforcement.She also confessed to being high while giving testimony in criminal cases and during interviews with police.While she was convicted of multiple crimes in 2014, officials did not disclose important details about how Farak s criminal activities had likely compromised tens of thousands of cases that she worked on.It took an order from the state Supreme Court to finally bring the extent of her misconduct to light.The ACLU released a statement on the Farak case, saying: The magnitude of the Amherst Lab misconduct rivals the similar scandal at the Hinton Lab, involving disgraced chemist Annie Dookhan, and the twin Massachusetts scandals have no known parallel elsewhere in the country. Matthew Segal, legal director of the ACLU of Massachusetts, went on to state: There is only one sensible response to these revelations: promptly notify the people who were denied due process, undo their wrongful convictions, and rethink the unjust war on drugs. The Boston Herald reports that Farak may have tainted the results in as many as 40,000 cases during the eight years she worked as a state crime lab chemist.Combined, the Dookhan and Farak scandals in MA alone could easily have caused more than 100,000 innocent people to be wrongfully imprisoned.If rampant corruption in just two state crime labs can result in the destruction of so many lives, we have to ask ourselves what is the impact when combined with corrupt law enforcement, corrupt courts and a corrupt penal system that thrives on profit?As the ACLU states here, fighting the failed war on drugs has only served to undermine the integrity of the entire criminal justice system.It s time to end the failed drug war, once and for all.Image credit: Wikimedia Commons",News,"May 8, 2016",3573
"OREGON: Feds Cover-up Foul Play in Finicum Death, Feds’ Shell Casings ‘Have Gone Missing’","21st Century Wire says As it turns out, we were right about the ambush, and we were right about the cover-up. After all this, the quislings at the The Oregonian are still trying to tart-up this FBI and OSP debacle by calling it a  traffic stop . While forced to now admit that there was foul play on the infallible government s part, mainstream media gatekeepers are still trying to paint the incident as a  traffic stop    which is beyond a joke.Get ready for another government-issued  magic bullet  fairy tale to protect the hired guns.How long before we can call this an assassination? New findings by law enforcement officials suggest that an FBI agent on the scene of the fatal shooting of Bundy-affiliated protester LaVoy Finicum during a Jun. 26 felony stop might have fired two shots that were not reported, and agents on the scene might have disposed of bullet casings to cover them up.According to The Oregonian, investigators believe that the shots were fired approximately at the moment at which LaVoy Finicum was exiting his truck with his hands up, prior to when he appears to reach into his jacket and is shot by two Oregon State Police troopers. The above-embedded slow-motion video shows the moment at which investigators believe the shots were fired.Deschutes County Sheriff Shane Nelson and Malheur County District Attorney Dan Norri, who investigated the incident, concluded that the Oregon State Police officers were justified in shooting Finicum, but also announced that they believe that an FBI agent took two unreported shots and then lied about it. The U.S. Department of Justice has subsequently launched a criminal investigation into the conduct of the FBI agents on the scene.The Oregonian s Les Zaitz wrote,  A state trooper later described to investigators seeing two rifle casings in the area where the [FBI] agents were posted. Detectives tasked with collecting evidence didn t find the casings, police reports indicate. He added,  FBI aerial surveillance video shows that before the detectives could get there, the FBI agents searched the area with flashlights and then huddled, according to law enforcement sources who have seen the video. The group then broke and one agent appeared to bend over twice and pick up something near where the two shots likely were taken. Police reports indicate that detectives showed up to collect evidence around 90 minutes after the moment in the surveillance video in which the FBI agent appeared to pick items up from the ground.All of the FBI agents on the scene that day claimed that they did not take any shots. A state trooper said he had fired three shots while the truck was speeding towards police and two more at Finicum as he was reaching into his jacket after he had exited the vehicle. Police inventory records show that the trooper was missing five rounds after the incident, apparently confirming his story.A fourth bullet hole in the truck came from a different angle of trajectory suggesting that an FBI agent had fired the shot. Investigators believe a second shot, which missed Finicum and did not strike the truck, was also fired by an FBI agent Continue this story at Truth In MediaREAD MORE OREGON STANDOFF NEWS: 21st Century Wire Oregon Files",US_News,"March 17, 2016",3234

 Republicans Now Trying To Draft Billionaire Mark Cuban For Third Party Run,"A group of desperate republicans which includes Mitt Romney, William Kristol, Erick Erickson, Mike Murphy, Stuart Stevens and Rick Wilson, among others, is desperately trying to find someone to present a third party challenge to Donald Trump.According to the Washington Post, the group of more than a dozen republicans is  commissioning private polling, lining up major funding sources  and courting potential contenders. Among those contacted by the group was billionaire Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks and reality TV star.Cuban told the Washington Post that the group thought he would make a good candidate, based on his  loud persona,  and  ability to connect with voters. As Addicting Info reports here, back in December during an appearance on The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore, the NBA team owner had nothing good to say about republican frontrunner Donald Trump.Cuban said: There s so much more to come (from Trump). Because they re not playing for real yet. There s nothing at stake yet. This is all just chit chat. He s just warming up the audience. He s like that guy who is going into a bar and he ll say whatever it will take to get laid. Only in this case, he s not trying to f*ck some girl, he s trying to f*ck the country. While Cuban has also criticized Donald Trump s anti-Muslim fearmongering, the billionaire has come under fire for racist remarks of his own.While speaking at a conference in Nashville in 2014, Cuban said: I know I m prejudiced, and I know I m bigoted in a lot of different ways. If I see a black kid in a hoodie on my side of the street, I ll move to the other side of the street. When he was asked about keeping racism out of the NBA, Cuban responded by saying, You don t. There s no law against stupid. I m the one guy who says don t force the stupid people to be quiet. I want to know who the morons are. In other words, let racists be racists.According to the Washington Post Cuban says it s unlikely he ll launch a third party bid to challenge Trump because he doesn t believe there is enough time to mount a successful campaign.The group admits there is very little time left to achieve the goal, but they aren t ready to give up yet.As Addicting Info reported here, Romney was at first considered to be a possible third party candidate. Although he decided not to enter the race himself, he is now helping in the effort to find someone who will.According to the Washington Post, Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse is next on the list of possible recruits.Featured image via Brian Solis via Flickr",News,"May 15, 2016",2546
" MAJOR Ad Vendor Bans Breitbart For Hate Speech, Trump LIVID","You know how Donald Trump has been trying to convince us that Steve Bannon is a great guy and his publication, Breitbart, is just a news website that isn t a haven for white supremacists, white nationalists, and a diverse array of racists, bigots, and people who are fine with racism? Well, that s going to be just a teensy bit harder now after the publication was banned by an ad vendor for hate speech. Breitbart is just a publication,  Trump said in a recent interview with the New York Times.  They are certainly a much more conservative paper, to put it mildly, than the New York Times. But Breitbart really is a news organization that has become quite successful. It s got readers, and it does cover subjects on the right, but it covers subjects on the left also. It s a pretty big thing. There s no question that Breitbart is a  big thing,  but that s not exactly a good thing when it s something that Bannon himself described Breitbart as the  platform for the alt-right,  a term used to describe white supremacists who took a day off of abusing methamphetamines to throw on a suit and complain about the plight of white people in a seemingly legitimate setting. Nevertheless, Trump says he would never have hired Bannon had he any indicator (like an admission from Bannon that he runs a large platform for white supremacists) that he was alt-right: I ve known Steve Bannon a long time. If I thought he was a racist, or alt-right   I wouldn t even think about hiring him. The Donald says that he intends to get to the bottom of what is energizing the extreme Right (him) and find out why (because he appeals to racists).Trump s decision to appoint a white nationalist to a high-level position spurred AppNexus, a major advertising technology provider, to look into what sort of operation Bannon had birthed   and they didn t like what they found:AppNexus Inc., a major advertising technology provider, has barred Breitbart News from using its ad-serving tools because the conservative online publisher violated its hate speech rules.AppNexus scrutinized Breitbart s website after U.S. President-Elect Donald Trump tapped Steve Bannon, former executive chairman of Breitbart, to be White House chief strategist last week. The digital ad firm decided the publication had breached a policy against content that incites violence, said AppNexus spokesman Joshua Zeitz. We did a human audit of Breitbart and determined there were enough articles and headlines that cross that line, using either coded or overt language,  he said.Bloomberg notes that while Breitbart does not buy ads from AppNexus directly, the ban means that they will not receive ads from the ad server the company runs and this will likely lower the price of ads on the site   which means less money for the modern day Neo-Nazis.Will more advertising companies follow suit? Only time will tell   but the pressure is certainly on!Featured image via Getty Images (Ben Jackson)",News,"November 22, 2016",2945

How ironic is it that two men who lied under oath are speaking  truth  to power FYI: John Brennan literally voted for the Communist party in the 1970s during the height of the Cold War now they re lecturing us about Russia.These two men define the deep state This talk was really all about creating doubt on Trump and to defend themselves post Obama.

Shameful!All you have to do is listen to Clapper lie before Congress and you know he has ZERO credibility to speak:Remember the famous moment when US NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE CHIEF James Clapper was testifying about the NSA surveillance of Americans when he let slip a sign he was not being truthful. Of course, we knew this was all a smoke and mirrors show. Clapper later said he  misspoke last we checked it s pretty much the same thing as lying NOT WITTINGLY    JAMES CLAPPERHere s the video below where he parses words in his testimony: REMEMBER WHAT CLAPPER SAID RECENTLY ABOUT TRUMP:Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper says the United States  political institutions are currently  under assault  both externally and internally, in the wake of President Donald Trump s firing of ex-FBI Director James Comey. The developments of the past week are very bothersome, very disturbing to me,  Clapper said on CNN s  State of the Union  on Sunday. I think in many ways our institutions are under assault, both externally   and that s the big news here, the Russian interference in our election system   and I think as well, our institutions are under assault internally, When asked if he meant if those institutions were  under assault  internally by the president himself, Clapper said  exactly  and added that he believed Trump was undermining the checks and balances inherent to the U.S. political system.",left-news,"Jul 24, 2017",2321
Jared Kushner NEVER Registered To Vote As A “Female”…Media Lie BACKFIRES…Shines Bright Light On How Easily Voter Fraud Can Occur,"Meanwhile, as President Trump continues to meet resistance from blue states in his effort to clean up voter fraud, one of his most vocal opponents is none other than the Democrat governor of New York, the same state where the board of elections made the mistake of changing Kushner s identity to a  female  AFTER he registered as a  male . It seems like this may be just the high-profile screw-up the White House has been waiting for in order to revisit the legitimacy of voter rolls in New York.NY refuses to perpetuate the myth voter fraud played a role in our election. We will not comply with this request.https://t.co/eQC6ORV0v1  Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) June 30, 2017Kushner, President Trump s son-in-law, and senior adviser did in fact list himself as a male in his New York voter registration   but an elections database error led to him getting listed as a female.Kushner s supposed registration as a woman, which made headlines Wednesday, is actually a data entry error that the New York Board of Elections corrected only after it became public.A Wired story first reported that Kushner   whose father-in-law has been waging a fact-challenged war on voter fraud   was registered as a woman on his publicly accessible New York State voter information.   NYDaily NewsThe Wired story that was written by Ashley Feinberg suggests one of the reasons Kushner registered to vote as a female may be attributed to him committing voter fraud, which according to Feinberg,  would, of course, would be interesting, considering that Trump s White House has been fixated on allegations that rampant voter fraud took place during the 2016 election. The Huffington Post used the fake news story to prove that Jared Kushner is not capable of brokering peace in the Middle East. Here is their headline for an article written by Amanda Terkel:From the Huffington Post article:If people weren t already skeptical that Kushner   a man who inherited his father s real estate empire and has no policy experience in the Middle East or elsewhere   could achieve the impossible, recent developments may give further pause.He registered to vote as a woman.Radical leftist and (sometimes) comedian Jimmy Kimmel did an entire skit on Jared Kushner registering to vote as a  female.  We ll wait for his apology #VeryFakeNewsCNN quickly jumped on the story without verifying why Jared Kushner was registered as a female. Given the incompetence of our government agencies, one would think CNN would give Kushner the benefit of the doubt, but alas, giving anyone close to President Donald J. Trump the benefit of the doubt would be counter-productive to the Trump-hating network who only has one goal, and that is to destroy Donald Trump and anyone who dares to stand with him. CNN has changed the story that was originally attached to this tweet to reflect their update, but their headline that attempts to paint Kushner as either a liar or a cheat stands on Twitter.Jared Kushner is registered to vote as a female https://t.co/MtWq9uHTC7 pic.twitter.com/1ub2dS6OFM  CNN (@CNN) September 27, 2017Another loudmouth liberal who goes by the name of  Ring of Fire  on Youtube and has over 130K followers, has completely embarrassed himself by using Kushner s inability to  fill out a simple form  or  who is so careless, or reckless, or downright stupid that he cannot fill out a form .",politics,"Sep 29, 2017",3362
 Woman Stabs Black Man In The Face On Christmas For Offering Her His Train Seat,"Apparently, in Donald Trump s America, you can t even be nice to someone if your skin is darker than a piece of chalk. After he was elected, we saw a spike in hate crimes that would make anyone   especially people who already faced discrimination beforehand, nervous.On Sunday   that s the Christmas that Donald Trump says he saved if you re keeping score  Ijan DaVonte, a black transgender man, decided to show some holiday spirit by offering his seat to a woman who was entering his train car. While most would view this as an act of generosity   especially at almost midnight on Christmas   Stephanie Pazmino decided that she was offended by someone being nice to her. I don t want to sit next to a black person,  were the words that came out of her mouth, according to police. I got up anyway and said to her that she didn t have to sit next to me,  said Jarrett, who had just gotten done working his shift as a hair stylist.  I took a seat across from her and just forgot all about it.  When Pazmino got up to leave the train, a simple insult became much, much worse when she began punching Jarrett. It was not until later when another man rushed to his aid that he realized that Pazmino had slashed his face and stabbed him in the arm with a 2-inch knife. She stabbed me right under my left eye, on the back of my hand and on my left arm. She was screaming and hollering the whole time,  he recalled. I ran to the ticket booth to ask the attendant to call the police, she stated that she did and that I should sit down. And I passed out after that,  Jarrett said. He was transported to Harlem Hospital where he was treated and is in stable condition, according to PIX11. Pazmino was arrested and charged with a hate crime.Jarrett says he doesn t know if he was targeted because he is transgender, as well, though the racial component is bad enough. I don t know why she did it because I didn t do anything to provoke her,  Jarrett says.Unfortunately, we re going to be seeing more of this with Donald Trump as president. At this point, it s safe to assume that if you are a group that regularly faces discrimination, you are in danger   always.Featured image via screengrab",News,"December 27, 2016",2179
" Trump Is Trying To Discredit Bob Mueller, And Here’s How","With the news dropping that supposedly Trump isn t under an investigation for obstruction of justice, we re all scratching our heads. Especially since Trump admitted he s under investigation himself.ABC This Week with George Stephanopoulos has an idea of what s going on. The President wants to take down Bob Mueller. His lawyer wants to take down Bob Muller and the question is why? And I think the answer is they wanna lay the foundation to discredit whatever Bob Mueller comes up with,  Stephanopoulos said in a video posted on Twitter.Given that Trump himself has admitted on Twitter that he is under investigation and that it s a  witch hunt , it sounds like a very plausible answer.Stephanopoulos goes on to say that  They re essentially engaging in a  scorched-earth  litigation strategy that is beginning with trying to discredit the prosecutor. He closes the video by saying that Mueller is just doing his job and is only just getting started, so we shouldn t just automatically dismiss Mueller or that Trump is being investigated.Stephanopoulos has a point. It does seem likely that Trump and his team would try to cover an investigation up. They don t want the public to know   it would damage his reputation (not that he has a glowing one in the first place).Why shouldn t we believe what Trump tweets? He knows what he s tweeting. Why shouldn t we believe the other sources?An excerpt of  This Week  shows Pierre Thomas, ABC News Senior Justice Correspondent saying  Now, my sources are telling me he s begun some preliminary planning. Plans to talk to some people in the administration. But he s not yet made that momentous decision to go for a full-scale investigation. If that s the case, it s possible that Mueller is backing off on the idea of investigating Trump. Why?Obviously, something is going on behind the scenes.

 Donald Trump Proves He Knows NOTHING About America’s Workforce,"During Donald Trump s most recent press conference on Wednesday, he mentioned that 96 million Americans were looking for jobs and could not find any. Well, as it turns out, that number is only about 10 times higher than the truth.According to Mr. Trump America has millions of  workers right now in the United States that are   96 million really wanting a job and they can t get. You know that story. The real number   that s the real number. That s incorrect, by quite a bit. Now, maybe if he hadn t repeated that he believed  that s the real number  then he could have recovered from the situation. If he had said 9.6 million, he would have at least been in the right ball park. America does have 96 million people without jobs, but that s including anyone above 16 years of age that is a student, disabled, a stay-at-home parent, retired or not in the workforce for whatever reason, not actively searching for a job.The actual number of Americans that are jobless but actively seek work is only 7.5 million. Add another 2.3 million for  missing workers , those who are unemployed and don t seek work because they don t see much opportunity, that number is 9.8 million workers. So maybe Donald Trump was confused or very misinformed? Either way these numbers are certainly something he should be aware of.Trump is also probably unaware of the fact that the economy is doing great right now, with 15.6 million private sector jobs being added in the last six and a half years thanks to President Obama. However, according to Donald Trump Obama has done nothing good for this country. Is he in denial or just an idiot? Maybe if he went to his intelligence briefings every once in awhile he d know what he was talking about more often.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"January 11, 2017",1778
"HOW MEMPHIS TEEN DEFIED OBAMA’S “Black Victim” Narrative…Used Positive Attitude And Strong Work Ethic, Not Violence or Freebies To Make A Better Life [VIDEO]","After 8 brutal years of race-baiting, endless stories of victimhood, organizing with Black Lives Matter activists terrorists in our White House, and the worst racial-division we have seen in our nation in decades, this young man s inspirational story is truly a breath of fresh air Barack and Michelle Obama have worked very hard for the past 8 years to make every black American believe the unjust  system  in America is out to get them. They d like minorities in America to accept they ve been born into a system that won t allow them to get ahead in life, and without the Democrat Party they don t stand a chance. You never hear the Obama s tell minorities they have the ability to be anything they want, or that with hard work and commitment to making a better life for themselves, anything is possible. That s because the Democrat Party has always believed that unless they can keep the citizens down and dependent on the government, there will no longer be a need for their party. It s a survival thing, and the Black community is paying a heavy price for the Democrat Party s desire for power. Here s an inspirational story about one smart kid who was blessed to have a mother who didn t buy into Obama s victim mentality:A teenage boy in Tennessee used hard work, planning and dedication to earn enough money to pay for college before he even starts. I just stay away from the negativity and try to always be positive,  Kevuntez King told WHBQ.King said he grew up in a single-parent home with his mother, whose influence paved his way to success. She just taught me how to be independent like she had it, (and) she just wanted me to go get it myself,  he said.From age 12 to 17, King sold newspapers with one goal: earn enough to pay for his entire college education. And he did just that. When it came down to school, my mom didn t have to come out of pocket to do anything or I didn t have to take out any loans to go to school,  he told WHBQ.He earned $200 every Sunday for five years straight and was just accepted into Tennessee State University.King has this piece of advice to share:  Make sure you surround yourself with people that s trying to go up in life and not trying to bring you down.

"BREAKING! Ammon, Ryan Bundy, 5 Fellow Patriots: NOT Guilty On ALL Charges Related To Oregon Standoff! [VIDEO]","Who could forget the unbelievable standoff in Oregon between patriots and the government?  Who could forget the dramatic shooting of patriot Savoy Finicum who traveled from Arizona to Oregon from to stand with American ranchers against the BLM, an overbearing government agency. Oregon State Police troopers fired the three rounds that killed the Arizona rancher and father of 11 during a confrontation on a remote road, law enforcement officials said at a news conference in Bend.An independent investigation by Oregon authorities later found the troopers were justified in shooting Finicum because he failed to heed their commands and repeatedly reached for his weapon, Masher County District Attorney Dan Norris said.The not guilty verdict of the other members who were involved with Finicum who gave his life for the fight against our government, must be especially stinging for the large loving  family this father of 11 left behind.As expected, liberals are freaking out over the verdicts, like this Black Lives Matter crybaby:I have a criminal record for protesting for #FreddieGray meanwhile #oregonstandoff terrorists didn't even get a slap on the wrist.  Kwame Rose (@kwamerose) October 28, 2016Here are the verdicts. #oregonstandoff pic.twitter.com/fXW9GoxKUr  Ryan Haas (@ryanjhaas) October 27, 2016Ammon and Ryan Bundy have been found not guilty of conspiracy. Their five co-defendants Jeff Banta, Shawna Cox, David Fry, Kenneth Medenbach and Neil Wampler have all been found not guilty as well. Jurors were unable to reach a verdict on Ryan Bundy s theft of government property charge.The jury returned its verdict after some six weeks of testimony followed by less than six hours deliberations, and the last minute replacement of a juror after an allegation surfaced that he was biased.The jury was instructed to disregard their previous work and to re-consider the evidence. It was a pretty jaw-dropping verdict,  said OPB reporter Amelia Templeton of the climate in the courtroom. The jury began by reading out the verdict for Ammon Bundy, ostensibly the leader of the occupation, and when we heard that Ammon Bundy was not guilty, it became clear very quickly that likely no one in the case was going to be found guilty, and indeed, everyone has been acquitted. After the verdict was read, Ammon Bundy s attorney Marcus Mumford was tackled to the ground by five U.S. Marshals. He insisted his client was free to go. Ammon Bundy faces a US Marshall hold and is supposed to be transferred to Nevada where he faces charges for the Bunkerville standoff. There s a hold for Ammon Bundy and Ryan Bundy out of the district of Nevada,  said Matt Schindler attorney for Kenneth Medenbach. There s nothing Judge Brown can do about that. So acquitting him here, all it does is effectively release him to that hold, to be transported to Nevada. And the court that has anything authority to deal with that, is the court in Nevada. Marcus let the emotion of the moment, I think, overtake his better judgement. During the incident, Judge Brown ordered everyone out of the courthouse. Mumford was later detained.United States Attorney for the District of Oregon Billy J. Williams reacted to the decision on Thursday saying,  While we had hoped for a different outcome, we respect the verdict of the jury and thank them for their dedicated service during this long and difficult trial.  The charges stem from the 41-day armed occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge near Burns in eastern Oregon s high desert. The armed protest began Jan. 2 and ended when the final four occupiers surrendered to the FBI on Feb. 11. For many weeks, hundreds of law enforcement officers   federal, state, and local   worked around-the-clock to resolve the armed occupation at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge peacefully,  said Greg Bretzing, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI in Oregon.  Although we are extremely disappointed in the verdict, we respect the court and the role of the jury in the American judicial system. Prosecutors initially charged Ammon Bundy, his brother Ryan Bundy, and 24 others with conspiracy to prevent Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Fish and Wildlife employees from doing their jobs at the wildlife refuge in Harney County. Some defendants named in the indictment faced weapons charges for carrying firearms in a federal facility, as well as theft of government property.Only seven defendants went to trial in September. Others have pleaded guilty or are scheduled to go to trial in February 2017. Oregonian ",Government News,"Oct 27, 2016",4539

"FOUR PREVIOUSLY DEPORTED ILLEGAL ALIENS Charged In Rape, Beating Of Couple","There are numerous crimes we report on every day that do not tell if the criminal is in America legally. When we find a news source that actually tells you we re shocked! The main stream media is really good at hiding the details of criminals like the ones who committed the crime below. The Boston Herald reported when it came to light that the accused are in the U.S. illegally.Federal immigration officials are requesting detainers on four illegal aliens accused of a heinous attack on a Framingham couple in which the woman was raped and her boyfriend was beaten and threatened with death, the Herald has learned.Two of the illegals had previously been deported to Guatemala, said Immigration and  Customs Enforcement spokesman Shawn Neudauer.Elmer Diaz, 19, is charged with rape, assault with a dangerous weapon, kidnapping and threatening to commit a crime. His brother, Ariel Diaz, 24, was charged with unarmed robbery, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, indecent assault and battery, kidnapping and witness intimidation.He was deported to Guatemala in May 2014 after convictions for drunken driving and disorderly conduct, said Neudauer.Another brother, Adan Diaz, 32, and Marlon Josue Jarquin-Felipe, 27, are both charged with indecent assault and battery and kidnapping. All four suspects are from Guatemala. Jarquin-Felipe was deported back to his homeland in April 2014, according to Neudauer.Neudauer told the Herald yesterday the agency is  closely monitoring the cases and has placed detainers on all four  illegal immigrants. He added that Ariel Diaz was also arrested this winter on a drunken driving charge. ICE was not notified of that case, he added.In the Framingham case, the victim s boyfriend was beaten while his girlfriend was held down on a bed and raped Sunday evening, authorities say.The still-shaken boyfriend told the Herald yesterday that he and his girlfriend have not yet come to terms with the horrific assault.

 Hillary Clinton’s New Tax Plan Will Make Trump’s Kids FURIOUS,"Since the Reagan administration, Americans have been sold a bill of goods that tells us that inherited money is more valuable than earned money. Republicans would like all inherited money to be completely sheltered from any taxation, while for the most part, Democrats disagree. The compromise has been that only estates valued at a whopping $5.45 million or more ($10.9 million for married couples) are taxed. Anything below that is completely tax free.Now, Hillary Clinton, after prodding from Bernie Sanders and his followers, has revised her estate tax plan and trust me when I say Donald Trump s children won t be happy.Previously, Clinton said she would restore the tax on dead rich folks to its 2009 levels, pushing up the rate from 40 percent to 45 percent, and making it kick in for estates worth at least $3.5 million (today, it only hits those valued at $5.45 million or more). But, no longer. Instead, she s borrowed a page from her formal primary rival, and now proposes turning the levy into a progressive tax meaning it will take a bigger bite out of wealthier estates with a top rate of 65 percent. The last time the estate tax hit that level was in 1982, though back then it also kicked in on smaller inheritances.Beyond all that, Clinton has said she would largely do away with the step-up in basis at death, a rule that allows lucky heirs to avoid paying capital gains taxes that, say, their parents or uncle or other rich benefactor would have owed had they sold their stock before passing away.In the end, the committee expects these measures to raise about $225 billion over ten years.Source: SlateAs it stands, the estate tax system is a joke. In 2012, a staggering $1.2 trillion was passed down as an inheritance. Of that, less than 1 percent was taxed. As for the Republican argument that estate taxes will hurt small businesses, in 2013, only 20 small businesses and family farm estates, in the entire country, had to pay estate taxes.The other common Republican argument is that estate taxes are  double taxation  (as if every other dollar in the American economy hasn t been taxed multiple times), but the reality is that most of what comprises large estates comes from capital gains, which are also unlikely to have every been taxed.Of course, even if Clinton is elected, she ll have a tough time passing this, at least as long as Paul Ryan is in charge of the House. He wants Trump s kids to pay zero in estate taxes. Of course, for all we know, Trump himself pays zero in taxes.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images.",News,"September 22, 2016",2553
GAME CHANGER: HOW TRUMP IS BRINGING BACK The “Missing Voter” The GOP Forgot About,"One of the most interesting and insightful pieces you will read on the reason Americans are drawn to Trump Where did all the Trump voters come from, and where did the Cruz evangelicals go? One of the great mysteries of the 2016 primary is how so many assessments of the Republican electorate turned out to be wrong. The primary electorate that gave us Donald Trump as the presumptive nominee was dramatically different from the one that chose Mitt Romney in 2012.Jeb Bush thought there was a huge, quiescent moderate majority nostalgic for a return to the Bush era, or looking for a doggedly inoffensive candidate like himself, blessed with endorsements from all the right people and a campaign war chest so huge it was supposed to scare other candidates out of the race. Senator Rand Paul thought the GOP s libertarian moment had arrived, driven by young voters who were deeply concerned about privacy issues in the online era and weary of interventionist foreign policy under Bush and Obama alike. Senator Marco Rubio thought he had crossover appeal to every faction of the Republican Party and so much electability that GOP voters would be crazy to turn him down. Governors like Rick Perry and Scott Walker thought voters in other states would be impressed by their successful resumes.Most baffling was the miscalculation of Senator Ted Cruz, who was counting on a Southern conservative and evangelical firewall that should have made him an early front-runner. Cruz had every reason to think those voters were out there and every reason to suppose they would be unwilling to support Donald Trump, on both moral and policy grounds.Instead, Trump cleaned up with evangelicals, and his eventual victory in the primary was heralded by many observers as a death knell for  movement conservatism.  At the very least, we were told, conservatives were in such disarray that they couldn t unite around a candidate who could stop Trump, even though well over half the party didn t want him as the nominee.The alternative theory of Trump s primary victory is that he s bringing new voters into the Republican primaries, and it s clearly not just a few saboteurs looking to set Hillary Clinton up with her preferred GOP opponent.NBC News is the latest outlet to run a story on Trump bringing new voters into the GOP fold, noting that the 2016 Florida primary saw tens of thousands more votes cast than Mitt Romney s take in the 2012 general election, and the lion s share of the new votes went to Trump. In Establishment-friendly Northeastern races, Ohio Governor John Kasich pulled vote totals comparable to Romney s primary vote in 2012, but Trump s new voters swamped him.Sean Trende at RealClearPolitics suggested in January that neglected white working-class voters were coming back to the GOP after taking a pass on Mitt Romney in 2012. Trende described them as  mostly lower-income, blue-collar voters who lived in areas that had also voted for Ross Perot,  who had been turned off by  Mitt Romney s wealth and upper-class demeanor. Missing voter  theories abound after big elections, because so much of the eligible American electorate consistently chooses not to vote. With voter participation well under 60%, even in big presidential elections, the  missing electorate  is big enough to be a theoretical game-changer in virtually every race. It s arresting when a missing electorate returns, as Trende suggests is happening with Trump.Along the way, he makes the point that Ted Cruz was fundamentally wrong about who the missing voters were, as he frequently quoted analysts who misunderstood what Trende was saying in his 2012 election post-mortem.They weren t evangelicals miffed that Mitt Romney was a Mormon, or a moderate. The missing voters weren t mainly conservative Christians at all, since Trende notes that that cohort has always maintained a level of voter participation far above the national average. Many of the missing voters disengaged from politics long before 2012, and it s mostly because they didn t think either party had anything to offer them.The key to understanding this theory is to remember that Ross Perot brought a lot of disengaged working-class people into politics too, and besides his famous disdain for deficit spending, the big planks in his platform were opposition to illegal immigration and criticism of big trade deals, particularly the North American Free Trade Agreement, which both Bill Clinton and George H. W. Bush supported. In the second presidential debate in 1992, Perot famously spoke of  a giant sucking sound going south  to describe the effect NAFTA would have when American jobs went to Mexico.It s no surprise that Donald Trump is talking about NAFTA too, and getting a huge response at his campaign rallies, even as analysts on the Left and Right scratch their heads and wonder why he s talking about a  settled issue  from two decades ago after Bill Clinton signed it into law.To the missing voters, NAFTA has never been a settled issue, or a forgotten one. They re still hurting from the shift of jobs and opportunities out of the country. They were told not to worry about it, because new high-tech jobs with better pay and working conditions would replace the  jobs Americans just won t do  and then those jobs got sent overseas as well, or filled with H1-B visa workers.There is a line of argument from free trade enthusiasts that insists such policies are good for the country overall. We re told that controlling legal immigration, or even cracking down on illegal immigration could significantly damage the U.S. economy. These grand strategies overlook the fact that the people who have been getting clobbered for decades to provide this higher level of national prosperity are tired of being the designated losers. On both the Left and Right, there is anger from people who believe they have been exploited to make others wealthy. That s the fundamental argument of liberal ideology, but Republican leaders really should have noticed when a substantial number of their traditional constituents began feeling that way.These disaffected working-class people are especially weary of master plans that deliberately injure Americans for the benefit of big U.S. investors and foreign interests. That s why a willingness to speak frankly about immigration was such a powerful signal to the missing voters, a sign that Trump was aware of them, in a way that few other Republicans were.The core element of any fair deal for neglected American workers is the acknowledgement that America exists, and its government understands that it has a unique responsibility to American citizens. There is nothing inherently hostile or xenophobic about that understanding. The put-upon citizens of the most open and generous country in the world are tired of being insulted as selfish and hateful for insisting our national priority should be our nation.For decades now, our central government has asserted the wisdom and moral stature to pick  winners and losers.  Those assertions are especially loud from Barack Obama, but he wasn t the first to make them. The people who feel they ve been picked as losers, for generations, are tired of it.Trende talked about the shifting  priorities  of these voters, which could go a long way toward explaining why Cruz didn t get the support he was looking for in the South. It s not so much a question of those voters rejecting Constitutional conservatism, as their political priorities shifting to more immediate concerns.They re under attack by the federal government, and they want relief. Intellectual discourse on the Constitutional basis for freedom of religious expression has less political value when the federal government is sending a battalion of lawyers to escort men into the women s restroom. They still care about our future of unsustainable government debt, but their more immediate concern is getting the economy moving for their regions and income brackets again. Abstract discussion about the proper limits of government gives way to more concrete concerns: What will you do to bring the jobs back, nourish our wages back to health, and make us feel like something more than targets?Some of the blame for those errors is due to the Republican Party at large, which frittered away the Reagan legacy through both Bush presidencies, and allowed the Left to teach the masses what  capitalism  means. Reagan brilliantly redefined the relationship between American citizens and their government, but as soon as he was gone, the GOP allowed that new understanding to be erased, perhaps mistakenly convinced it was unnecessary to defend capitalism from socialism while the Soviet Union was busy collapsing into a pile of ashes.A gulf developed between Republican leadership and the voters they should be able to reach. Until now, they didn t realize how wide that gulf was. They didn t invest nearly enough effort in figuring out who the missing voters were or how to bring them back. On the contrary, the GOP leadership devoted more energy to stamping out the first sign of renewed political life from those disaffected Americans, the Tea Party movement. Instead of understanding who those people were, absorbing their strength into the Republican coalition, or really listening to what they were saying, the GOP Establishment set about marginalizing them. They didn t realize how much damage they were doing to themselves among people who were watching the fate of the Tea Party movement, without being active members of it.

SELFIE OF MUSLIM WOMAN MAKING PEACE SIGN Goes Viral…Twitter Account Shows She’s Not Really So Peaceful,"Another  moderate  Muslim A Muslim woman who was photographed taking selfies in front of a Belgian protest last week, earning her widespread praise for her cheerful stance against bigotry, reportedly praised Hitler and called for the killing of Jews in past Facebook posts.Zakia Belkhiri was photographed taking the selfies as she flashed a peace sign in front of Vlaams Belang protesters at the third annual Muslim Expo in Antwerp.The protests were part of the increasing resistance in Belgium and elsewhere in Europe to the flood of Muslim refugees pouring in from war-torn and poverty stricken countries in the Middle East and Africa. How To Neutralize Anti-Islam Protesters with a Selfie,  was the headline of a Vice.com article where the photos by Jurgen Augusteyns initially appeared.Belkhiri told the BBC she took the photos  to show that things can be different. And that we can live together, not next to each other but with each other. Social media commenters called Belkhiri  a badass  who put anti-Islamist protesters in their place. But the newfound notoriety brought scrutiny of Belkhiri s alleged Facebook and Twitter posts by Breitbart.com and other sites. Many were far more disturbing than anything Belkhiri was protesting.Here s a sample of one of the  peace-loving  Muslim woman s tweets:Belkhiri briefly deactivated her Twitter account, then reactivated it to first deny the posts were hers and then to apologize and explain that she had meant  Zionists.

BREAKING: SCHIZOPHRENIC COMMANDER IN CHIEF Sends 10 More WarshipsTo Defend Against Nuclear Iran While Working To Cut A Lopsided Deal With Them,"Which begs the question Whose corner is Obama in? Whose side has this President, who continues to downplay the genocide of Christians in the Middle East and openly demeans Israel s Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu taken in this civil war? Is he siding with the Sunni s or Shiite s? In the past 6 years one thing is clear, he certainly hasn t given us any reason to believe he s siding with America The aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt and escort guided missile cruiser USS Normandy were deployed to join 10 other American warships on the waters near Yemen to dissuade Iran from shipping weapons to Shiite Houthi rebels. This is really about sending a message,  a U.S. official, speaking about the deployment of the ships to Yemen, told The New York Times on condition of anonymity.  It is a message to our partners that we are in this and willing to support. It is a message to the Iranians that we re watching. It all has to do with the instability in Yemen. That is why those forces are there and have been recently increased,  Cmdr. Kevin Stephens, the spokesman for the Bahrain-based United States Fifth Fleet, told The Times.The U.S. ships have been deployed to deter  any illegal activity in the area,  including the illicit transit of Iranian weapons, he added.Last Tuesday, the United Nations Security Council imposed an arms embargo on the Iran-backed Houthis and their allies.CNN reports that the American ships lack the authority to  forcibly  board Iranian-flagged ships.However, CNN adds that the American warships will be  joining allied vessels from Saudi Arabia, Egypt and other partner nations prepared to intercept a convoy of seven to nine Iranian vessels believed [to be] headed for Yemen. The allies are prepared to board Iranian vessels if they proceed into Yemeni territorial waters. The Pentagon has denied that the USS Theodore Roosevelt and USS Normandy were deployed to interdict Iranian arms, Reuters reports.Following the deployment of U.S. ships, Hossein Amir Abdollahian, Iran s deputy foreign minister, expressed optimism about a ceasefire in the Yemen conflict. We are optimistic that in the coming hours, after many efforts, we will see a halt to military attacks in Yemen,  Abdollahian told Iranian Tasnim news agency on Tuesday, a day after the two ships were deployed, Reuters reports.In Yemen, Houthi rebels aligned with military units loyal to former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh have been fighting against Saudi-led airstrikes and armed groups loyal to Yemen s internationally recognized President Abd Rabbo Mansour Hadi.The U.S. has been increasing its Naval presence in the Gulf of Aden and the southern Arabian Sea amid reports that a convoy of Iranian ships possibly carrying military supplies for the Houthis is on its way to Yemen.Although the Obama administration described the naval deployment as a show of force, it has also acknowledged that the flotilla could be used to block Iranian military supplies to the Houthi rebels.The 12 ships are also meant to reassure U.S. ally Saudi Arabia, which has been carrying out a bombing campaign against the Houthis and their allies since March 26.Lt. General Michael Flynn tells FOX News host Chris Wallace that Obama s policy is  almost a policy of willful ignorance. :https://youtu.be/GUxyc8-a2qYUnnamed officials told The New York Times that  Saudi Arabia has been bombing in a campaign against the Houthis for weeks, and the United States wanted to make clear to Iran that it backed the airstrikes and shared Riyadh s concerns about a possible rebel takeover in Yemen. Some of the American ships near Yemen are reportedly carrying 2,000 Marines and have been off the Yemeni coast since before the U.S. evacuated its embassy in Sanaa back in February..There appears to be friction between the U.S. and Iran, despite the ongoing nuclear negotiations between Washington and Tehran. White House officials acknowledged that they were compartmentalizing policy on Iran by confronting the country s aggressive posture in the region even as American diplomats tried to complete an agreement with Iran to limit its nuclear program,  notes The Times.Secretary of State John Kerry and Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, have criticized Iran s military aid to the Houthi rebels.Earnest condemned Iran arming the Houthi rebels as  destabilizing  and accused the Islamic Republic of fueling violence in Yemen.He also denounced Iran arresting a reporter from The Washington Post and accusing him of espionage as  absurd. President Obama met with Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, to reassure him and his Sunni allies that are nervous about the nuclear talks with Shiite Iran.Via: Breitbart News",politics,"Apr 22, 2015",4764
"Trump’s Foreign Policy: Promote Stability NOT Change, Stop Helping Terrorists","21st Century Wire says We are sure that the military industrial complex is not at all happy about the prospect of using diplomacy before cruise missiles.In Donald Trump s foreign policy speech today he made numerous points that would lead us to believe that his stance on this area of policy will be radically different to what has become the norm.Aside from the usual campaign rhetoric of ensuring America has the strongest military on the planet, Trump made numerous points clearly stating that the military option will not be his first option.Trump specifically spoke of being very careful as to whom the US assists, particularly in the Middle East, and to only help those who are true allies, which is a clear stab at recent policies to arm and support terrorist groups to overthrow nations like Libya and Syria.He also explicitly stated that the US needs to  stop seeking radical change in the world , and instead look to promote stability through diplomacy saying: Our goal is peace and prosperity, not war and destruction. The presidential hopeful is also looking to drastically cool off the rising tensions with Russia. He called out so-called foreign policy experts for ruining the situation, and said: Easing of tensions and improved relations with Russia is absolutely possible. It would be easy to dismiss all of these statements as nothing but campaign rhetoric, but Trump appears to be positioning himself as the master dealmaker. He has nothing to gain from being a warmonger, as he is not tied to the military industrial complex interests like establishment candidates, so there is no real reason to doubt this anti-interventionist stance.Watch Donald Trump s full foreign policy speech here: ",US_News,"April 27, 2016",1709
TRANSGENDER PRISONER IN CA JAIL FOR MURDER IS GRANTED PAROLE FOR SEX CHANGE,"Just when you find yourself wondering if the world has gone completely mad you read a story like this that confirms that indeed, it has Gov. Jerry Brown is allowing parole for a transgender inmate who is trying to force California to become the first state to pay for sex reassignment surgery.A federal judge in April ordered the state to provide the surgery, which had been scheduled for July. It was delayed after the state appealed.The governor s office said Friday that Brown was taking no action on the Board of Parole Hearings  recommendation to release Michelle-Lael Norsworthy, which means her parole will proceed.The decision makes it less likely that the 51-year-old will be able to have surgery funded by the prison before she is released. Parole board spokesman Luis Patino said it usually takes about a week for an inmate to be released after the governor allows a parole to proceed.Brown decided Norsworthy is no longer dangerous, 30 years after she fatally shot Franklin Gordon Liefer Jr., 26, following an argument in a Fullerton bar in November 1985.Norsworthy, then 21, was convicted of second-degree murder after she shot Liefer three times. He died six weeks later.She is being held at Mule Creek State Prison, a men s prison in Ione, near Sacramento. Prison records refer to her by her birth name of Jeffrey Bryan Norsworthy, though she has lived as a woman since the 1990s.She was diagnosed with gender identity disorder in 1999 and began taking female hormones. She began asking the corrections department for the surgery in 2012 after learning a judge for the first time had ordered Massachusetts to provide an inmate with the procedure. However, that decision was overturned on appeal in December, and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to intervene.The 9th Circuit agreed to hear California s appeal of U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar s ruling and a hearing is scheduled for Thursday. The appellate court noted that the case raises serious legal questions about whether denying the surgery violates Norsworthy s constitutional rights against cruel and unusual punishment.The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation says it has met all of its legal requirements by providing Norsworthy with counseling and hormone therapy.The state filed paperwork in federal court Friday saying it has agreed to provide sex reassignment surgery for another inmate, Shiloh Quine, 56, to settle a separate lawsuit. CDCR evaluates every case individually, and in the Quine case, every medical doctor and mental health clinician who has reviewed this case, including two independent mental health experts, determined that this surgery is medically necessary for Quine,  corrections department spokesman Jeffrey Callison said in an emailed statement.Quine, formerly known as Rodney James Quine, is serving a life sentence for murder, kidnapping and robbery.Norsworthy testified at her parole hearing in May that she accepts responsibility for her crime. She said at the time, she was  pretty much drinking every day all day  but is now sober and attends Alcoholics Anonymous meetings in prison.She said she also takes steps to control her anger and make better judgments.Via: FOX News",left-news,"Aug 11, 2015",3199

" ‘Family Values’ GOPer Sexually Harasses Intern, No Longer Can Have Interns","Social conservatives run campaigns and win elections on platforms of so-called  family values.  Often, though, it turns out that these supposedly pure people are anything but. Case in point   Cheektowaga, New York lawmaker Angela Wozniak.This particular gem has now been forbidden to have interns after conducting an extramarital affair with one. After the young man, Elias Farah, shut the affair down, Wozniak began sexually harassing him. She also make his job a living hell, and kept him from attending and participating in events. After all of this came to light, a panel committee consisting of both Republicans and Democrats was formed to address this grossly and obviously improper conduct. Ultimately, it was decided that Wozniak was guilty of incredibly poor judgment  in conducting this affair and her behavior after it was over. There was, however, no way to prove on a legal level that Wozniak created a  hostile work environment  or sexually harassed Farah.Despite the lack of legal evidence, though, the investigating committee is now going to look into Wozniak s office every six months going forward. Also, her attempts to go after her accuser have luckily backfired, as she ironically ran for office after a Democratic opponent, Dennis Gabryszak, resigned over his own sexual scandal. A potential November Democratic opponent, sums up Wozniak s hypocritical behavior perfectly: She ran on a platform of family values based on the conduct of her predecessor. I hope to restore voters  confidence in their government and be a leader they can be proud of. And that is the problem with these holier than thou  family values  types. They make literal careers of condemning other people s lives and modes of living, all the while doing in private just what they preach against in public.No one would care if these people didn t try to pretend to be above the rest of us. But, since they do   good riddance to yet another  family values  hypocrite. I m sure it s only a matter of time before Angela Wozniak is forced to resign.Featured image via video screen capture from Raw Story",News,"March 10, 2016",2091
OOPS! VIDEO Shows Senator McCain Saying He’ll Fight To REPEAL and REPLACE Obamacare Only 9 Months Ago: “We have to scrap it entirely and start over”,"In spite of Senator John McCain s promise to his constituents only 9 months ago when he was running for reelection, that he would fight to repeal and replace Obamacare, McCain voted late last night with two other liberal Republican senators, and every Democrat senator to keep Obamacare intact.But that s not what Senator McCain promised Arizona voters he would do only 9 months ago On October 10, 2016, John McCain faced off against his Democrat opponent Congresswoman Kirkpatrick in a televised debate. At the center of the debate was the disastrous Obamacare and what could be done to fix it. McCain responded: For the first time in history, a major entitlement reform was rammed through the Congress of the United States without a single vote from the other side. I fought for weeks, and weeks, and weeks against Obamacare and they would not allow us an amendment. There was not a single amendment allowed. No input from the minority party. We were the minority party. Now Congresswoman Kirkpatrick wants us to sit down and work together. Here s how we work together, we repeal and we replace it. McCain went on to argue that the majority of the American people have  resoundingly rejected Obamacare. One of the debate moderators asked McCain if it was possible for Congress to try to improve Obamacare rather than to try to repeal it. McCain rejected the idea that it could be fixed and that the only solution is to repeal Obamacare:  We have to scrap it entirely and start over.  McCain went on to explain why Congress MUST repeal Obamacare,  It s a scam and the problem is, that the cost is becoming prohibitive and we ve got to change it and fix it. Watch Senator John McCain as he arrogantly throws his thumb down in defiance of his own party and joins two of the most liberal Republicans in the Senate to thumb their noses at President Trump, as they jump across the aisle to join their friends who shut them out of the first Obamacare vote.",left-news,"Jul 28, 2017",1951

 Rachel Maddow Perfectly Explains Why Trump’s Sketchy Deals Are So Dangerous To America (VIDEO),"We recently reported on how it has now come to light, thanks to the wonderful investigative reporting at The New Yorker, that Donald Trump is involved in some seriously shady business dealings. In one instance, he has a hotel that seems to be nothing more than a front for shady ties to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, which is considered to be a sponsor of terrorism. The people who signed off on the hotel deal also are corrupt as all hell, and seem to get their money by laundering it via government corruption. Well, there is one person in the news business who always breaks this stuff down in the best way possible: MSNBC s Rachel Maddow.On Thursday s edition of the Rachel Maddow Show, the fiery host explains the situation with Trump and his family s ties and how it could make Trump vulnerable to blackmail by these dangerous foreign terrorists. Of course, with Trump being president, that means the danger also extends to the American people. According to Maddow, this deal is so potentially dangerous that Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH), actually wants a whole new investigation just for this shady sham of a hotel deal.Another interesting tidbit that Maddow points out is the fact that it is illegal for American business people to do business with foreign entities that have been sanctioned due to terrorist ties. In fact, it s seen as such an egregious crime that if caught, one faces serious jail time. Hopefully, Trump s clear incompetence forces him to slip up on this one, and he winds up in prison, right where he belongs.There s no one like Rachel Maddow to explain something like this, though, so, without further ado, here is the video:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"March 7, 2017",1696

" Trump Will ANNHILILATE The Working Class He’s Pretending To Protect, And Here’s The PROOF","Throughout his campaign, Trump repeatedly told anyone he could brainwash that the U.S. doesn t win at anything anymore. Supposedly, we used to be the perennial powerhouse of the entire world (like Duke, North Carolina or Arizona are perennial powerhouses of NCAA basketball), but we ve fallen from that status, and now we don t win anything like the number of games we used to.In other words, we used to be able to tell the world what they would do, and they would do it. Now they don t. So Trump promised our working class that he would change that, and bring their jobs back, and make us so prosperous that those jobs would never disappear again and everyone would be begging to trade with us so they could have a tiny slice of our awesomeness.Whether Trump actually knows the truth or not is anyone s guess. He s too focused on  winning.  And he s told our suffering working class particularly blue-collar workers whose jobs are disappearing that the reason their jobs are gone is because we ve given too much to countries that don t deserve our largesse or whatever. He s convinced half the country that the 45 percent tariff he wants on imported goods from China, and the 35 percent tariff on goods from Mexico, will keep companies from outsourcing manufacturing.And the people who bought that are the ones who will hurt the worst from Trump s actual trade policies.The Economist pointed this massive problem with Trump s rhetoric out with a single chart. We have free trade agreements not just with two countries, but with 20. Those 20 countries represent a third of our imported goods, yes, but they also represent half of our exported goods:Image via The EconomistExport is one of the major drivers of our economy, and our dear Mr. Trump conveniently forgets that part of the equation when he rails against China, Mexico, and everyone else.In the chart above, the dark blue, on both sides, represents our trade due to NAFTA. We do an awful lot of exports to both Mexico and Canada, in addition to imports. It s not quite equal, but it s also not so disparate that we re at the horrible disadvantage that Trump claims we are with NAFTA. Millions of American jobs actually depend heavily on NAFTA remaining intact.As far as China, yeah, we seem to be at a big disadvantage. However, it actually balances out pretty well when we factor in our trade with other countries. China isn t raping us the way that Trump claims they are.In short, when you look at imports versus exports, we re not getting robbed at nearly the rate that Trump would have us believe. To listen to him talk, we only import foreign goods and we export nothing. If that were true, then yes, our trade agreements would be destroying American jobs the way he claims. The problem with that attitude, though, is not only that it s false, but it also shows that Trump s protectionist policies will destroy American exports and thus, American jobs.That, in turn, will further destroy the American working class   the very class that believes Trump will save them, their jobs, and their dignity from the evil, horrible, liberal Democrats that want to assassinate them. We wish these people knew how to look at this, but they don t. They re virtually killing themselves in their blindly staunch defense of Trump because they either can t, or won t, educate themselves.Education is for liberal elites anyway, so they shun it.Do we import more than we export? Yes. But imagine if some countries decided to stop accepting our products in retaliation for our not accepting theirs without a huge penalty attached. Our exports would fall off drastically, and thousands more Americans would lose their jobs, even with Trump s one-by-one coercion of companies looking to outsource.Seriously, Trump does not seem to understand any of this. We have a fucking president who doesn t get this and won t listen to the people who do because he thinks he s this amazing business genius and everyone else is just jealous, or something.He doesn t have to listen to anyone because he already knows everything, in other words.If he starts a trade war, which is what his trade policies would do should they actually be implemented, the working class he s claiming to protect will die an even more horribly painful death as countries retaliate against us for our unfair trade tactics.The global economy is far more complex than Trump and his idiotic, entitled, hypocritical, privileged, rich family and friends understand. We can t just implement protectionist policies, bring back those millions of lost manufacturing jobs, and give the world the finger. It does not work that way. It will never again work that way. Here s hoping that Congress can understand how he ll destroy us on trade and refuse to put it into action.Featured image by Drew Angerer via Getty Images",News,"December 11, 2016",4816
" Trump Takes Credit For Releasing JFK Files, But The Bill Requiring It Was Passed 25 Years Ago","Saturday morning, Trump was going through his usual routine of drinking six quarts of Red Bull while wistfully flipping through his Ivanka photo albums when a novel idea suddenly occurred to him. He raced to Twitter to let his eager followers know exactly what his plans were as the most powerful man in the world:Subject to the receipt of further information, I will be allowing, as President, the long blocked and classified JFK FILES to be opened.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 21, 2017That s right! Donald Trump will finally be opening that presidential book hidden in the Library of Congress (and found by Nicolas Cage) that contains all of the secrets passed down from president to president across the ages to reveal what really happened to JFK.Just kidding! Despite the fact that he tried to make it sound like it was his idea, and happening only under his authority, it turns out that the  JFK FILES,  as he so loudly put it, were scheduled to be released no later than next Thursday, October 26, 2017. Coincidentally, that date is exactly 25 years to the day after the  President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992  was passed by the 102nd Congress.Okay, I m kidding again. Democratic Senator and American hero John Glenn introduced the bill in July of that year   likely while production was wrapping up on Donald Trump s star cameo in the Hollywood blockbuster  Home Alone 2: Lost In New York. Especially relevant in the text of the bill is Section 2, which discusses the reasoning behind Senator Glenn s proposal of it.Isn t it weird, how Trump really emphasized the fact that the  JFK FILES  were  long blocked and classified  and that he was gonna do something about it? I mean, besides the fact that all he s actually doing is allowing an existing law to, uh, continue to exist and carry out as planned. No, what s weird is WHO  long blocked and classified  those files. John Glenn (who may or may not know the truth about the moon landing) was kind enough not to name the sitting president he was indicting in this bill for obstructing the files  release, but the math is pretty simple: From July to October of 1992, the entire time this bill was debated until its passage, the person referred to as  the executive branch  was former president (and even former-er CIA Chief) George H.W. Bush.A Republican. As usual.Anyway, thanks, Trumpykins! We really appreciate you, uh, not stopping this thing that was totally going to happen even if you d been hit by a meteor the day you admitted you were a sexual predator.

"HEY, BERNIE SANDERS: 18 SCHOOL SHOOTINGS Have NOT Happened This Year!","The left has locked onto a stat that 18 school shootings have happened this year. This is FAKE NEWS that needs to be shut down. Bernie Sanders and others referred to this statistic right after the Parkland mass shooting.Anti-gun groups included in the statistics a suicide at a school in Michigan that had been closed. This fake statistic trivializes the horrific crime that happened at Parkland or any other TRUE school shooting. EVERYTOWN FOR GUN SAFETY  TRIES TO HIJACK THE NARRATIVE:Everytown for Gun Safety, the Michael Bloomberg backed anti-gun group founded after the 2012 school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, was the original source for that particular statistic. The group s initial tweet claiming that the attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School was the 18th school shooting in 2018 has now been retweeted more than 1,200 times:Our hearts are with all those impacted by the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida today.This is the 18th school shooting in the U.S. in 2018. https://t.co/YdPLz4zuOS  Everytown (@Everytown) February 14, 2018The group defines a school shooting is  any time a firearm discharges a live round inside a school building or on a school campus or grounds. ACCIDENTAL GUN DISCHARGES AND SUICIDES AREN T  SCHOOL SHOOTINGS It turns out that  Everytown s database turns up ridiculous examples that ARE NOT school shootings:On January 10,  gunshots, which most likely originated off-campus, hit a window of the visual arts building at California State University, San Bernardino. Classes were immediately canceled as the university went into lockdown, though a police search failed to turn up any shooter on campus.  On February 5, in a suburb of Minneapolis,  a school liaison officer was sitting on a bench talking with some students when a third-grader pressed the trigger on the officer s holstered weapon, causing it to fire and strike the floor.  Those were no doubt terrifying incidents for the people involved, and they may even have policy implications, but they are not what anyone thinks of when they hear the phrase  school shootings. But the media and several prominent politicians, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), eagerly regurgitated the context-free statistic in the aftermath of the shooting in Florida, apparently without stopping to wonder why they hadn t heard about the other 17 school shootings that supposedly had happened since January 1.This isn t just an embarrassing case of confirmation bias. Spreading such misleading statistics affects how Americans from ordinary working people to elected officials understand and cope with these terrible incidents.",politics,16-Feb-18,2656
 Trump Just Outed Himself As YUUUGE Liar After Saying He Saw U.S. Plane Unloading Money To Iran,"Oh, Donald Trump. The pathological liar has struck again, although everyone should have seen this coming. At a rally in Daytona Beach, he made an absurd claim that he saw  top secret  footage of a U.S. plane unloading $400 million in payment to Iran the same day that four American detainees were released. Of course, he later used Twitter to try and backpedal, but all he really did was admit that he lied through his teeth:The plane I saw on television was the hostage plane in Geneva, Switzerland, not the plane carrying $400 million in cash going to Iran!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 5, 2016The tape that he saw allegedly came from Iran, and he made it out to be some kind of taunt on their part: It was interesting because a tape was made. Right? You saw that? With the airplane coming in   nice plane   and the airplane coming in, and the money coming off, I guess. Right? That was given to us   has to be   by the Iranians. And you know why the tape was given to us? Because they want to embarrass our country. They want to embarrass our country. And they want to embarrass our president because we have a president who s incompetent. They want to embarrass our president.I mean, who would ever think they would be taking all of this money off the plane and then providing us with a tape? It s only for one reason. And it s very, very sad. Oddly enough for him, intelligence officials had zero idea what he was talking about, since no such video exists. There are two yuuuge problems with this:And he has the nerve to call Hillary  Crooked Hillary,  in part because of the right-wing narrative that she mishandled classified info. As president, he ll brag about every juicy thing he sees because it makes him feel important and superior to have access to info that others don t have. He can t wait to tell the world how much better he is than they are.On Wednesday, a spokesperson said that he d simply mistaken a grainy video of detainees being released, which played on Fox News, for this  to secret  video. However, Trump made this absurd claim again on Thursday, in Portland, Maine, as if the video was part of the intelligence briefings he s getting as a presidential candidate.Those briefings have not yet begun.As his story began developing holes, and then unraveling entirely, Trump decided he had to scramble in order to avoid looking like the liar of liars caught in a lie. His tweet is meant to make it look like he d just made a mistake. It s in line with what his spokesperson said, but, again, the timeline is way off.All he really did was say,  I lied about this, but it doesn t matter! Sorry not sorry!

"YES, Obama CAN Appoint A Supreme Court Justice Before He Leaves…But Will He?","The President who has thumbed his nose at our US Constitution, and clearly has no respect for our rule of law, has the ability to appoint a Supreme Court Justice before he vacates the White House, but will he? In those few moments the Senate will go into what s known as an  intersession recess,  creating one golden moment when the president could test his recess-appointment powers by sending Judge Garland to the high court.A smattering of activists has asked him to give it a try, but Mr. Obama has given no indication that he s thinking about it. The White House didn t respond to a request for comment for this story.The move would be a legal gamble under the high court s last ruling in 2014 on recess appointments. That 9-0 decision overturned a handful of Mr. Obama s early 2012 picks, saying the Senate was actually in session when the president acted, so he couldn t use his powers.That ruling also said, however, that there s a difference between appointments made during the annual yearlong session of Congress, dubbed  intrasession,  which Mr. Obama used in 2012, and picks made at the end of the year, after Congress adjourns, which are known as  intersession. William G. Ross, a law professor at Samford University in Birmingham, Alabama, said Mr. Obama would have the power to elevate Judge Garland. But he said it would be  politically unwise and damaging to the prestige of the court. The consensus, though, is that Mr. Obama would be making a mistake to test it that theory. I think it s fair to use the word stretch. I don t know why he would try this. It would backfire,  said Louis Fisher, a scholar in residence at the Constitution Project who served for decades as Congress  top expert on separation-of-powers issues.He said Mr. Obama s 9-0 loss in the 2014 case should still be stinging someone who earned his law degree from Harvard University and taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago. Does he want to go down that road again?  Mr. Fisher said. Perhaps most problematic for Mr. Obama is that recess appointments have a shelf life. Even if he succeeds in putting Judge Garland on the bench, the appointment would expire at the close of 2017   and could end even earlier if the Senate confirms a full-fledged replacement named by Mr. Trump.Worse yet for Mr. Obama, Judge Garland would lose his seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit   oftentimes dubbed the second-most powerful court in the country. That means the president would be trading a lifetime of Judge Garland for less than a year of Justice Garland. Since Garland could serve only a year, he presumably would accomplish little and his service would be clouded by the strange and controversial circumstances of his appointment,  said Mr. Ross, the law professor.For entire story  Washington Times",left-news,"Jan 2, 2017",2815
 WATCH: Trump Gets Humiliated By New York Lawmaker For False 9/11 Claims,"It has been 15 years since the World Trade Center Twin Towers fell. But Republicans and Donald Trump still exploit it for political gain.During Trump s primary run for the Republican nomination, he made a claim that sent journalists into a frenzy of fact-checking. I watched when the World Trade Center came tumbling down,  Trump said during a rally last November.  And I watched in Jersey City, New Jersey where thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was coming down. Thousands of people were cheering. Trump doubled down the next day during an interview with George Stephanopoulos. It was on television. I saw it,  Trump said.  It was well covered at the time, George. Now, I know they don t like to talk about it, but it was well covered at the time. There were people over in New Jersey that were watching it, a heavy Arab population, that were cheering as the buildings came down. Not good. But what Trump is claiming never happened.After an exhaustive search, Politifact concluded:This defies basic logic. If thousands and thousands of people were celebrating the 9/11 attacks on American soil, many people beyond Trump would remember it. And in the 21st century, there would be video or visual evidence.Instead, all we found were a couple of news articles that described rumors of celebrations that were either debunked or unproven.Trump s recollection of events in New Jersey in the hours after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks flies in the face of all the evidence we could find. We rate this statement Pants on Fire.And on Friday, New York Rep. Gregory Meeks humiliated Trump for that very claim once again during a panel discussion about Trump s birtherism on CNN.Just like Trump won t admit that he is wrong about his birtherism, Trump has also not apologized for being wrong about Muslims cheering in America on 9/11.After Trump supporter Kayleigh McEnany claimed that Trump has renounced his birther past, Meeks pointed out that Trump himself should man up and publicly do it himself. Then he should say it. If he believes it, he should say it. There s a pattern with Donald Trump. I m still looking   and I m sure that everybody s still looking   for those  thousands of Muslims  that were cheering during 9/11. That has not taken place. We heard video where he says he was for the war in Iraq. He now says he wasn t. There s not any evidence where he was against the war in Iraq. There is a practice and pattern with Donald Trump, who continues to make noise he knows is completely incorrect,  Meeks continued.  He never apologizes about it. He leaves it out there. Here s the video via YouTube:Donald Trump is a coward and a liar and he is totally unqualified to be president. The 15th anniversary of 9/11 is on Sunday and you just know that Trump is going to make some outrageous claim in an effort to exploit the tragedy.Featured Image: Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"September 10, 2016",2909
Congressman Jim Jordan stops CNN gatekeeper Chris Cuomo on Benghazi cover-up," 21st Century Wire says Once again, Operation Mockingbird has been deployed in order to bury another damaging White House scandal. It happened on Secretary of State Hillary Clinton s watch: the 2012 attacks on the covert US facility in Benghazi, Libya has been covered up from the beginning, and according to Ohio Republican Rep.

CNN s Chris Cuomo says Americans are  criminals  for reading WikiLeaks  Clinton email dumpIn order to cover-up 2011-2012 US gun-running through Libya and into Syria, and to help deflect another scandal away from Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton, the White House turned again to Obama appointee   Attorney General Loretta Lynch, who then ordered the DOJ to drop all charges against the State Department and CIA middleman and arms dealer, Marc Turi, who brokered many of Washington s illegal weapons deals in Benghazi,. Federal court records obtained by Politico confirm: The deal averts a trial that threatened to cast additional scrutiny on Hillary Clinton s private emails as Secretary of State, and to expose reported Central Intelligence Agency attempts to arm rebels fighting Libyan leader Moammar Qadhafi.

PLAYBOY “REPORTER” WHINES About Getting No Respect From Trump’s Female Deputy Press Secretary [VIDEO],"Only a liberal  man  who works for a magazine that made a fortune by exploiting women would complain that President Trump s female Deputy Press Secretary isn t giving him enough respect. Yesterday a 56-year-old reporter representing Playboy magazine had an epic meltdown in the White House press briefing room after White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee-Sanders put him in his place following the release of an undercover bombshell video by Project Veritas that exposed CNN as a network that fabricates news for ratings.Brian Karem complained about journalists being called out as  fake news  when they report falsehoods, and protested on behalf of the honor of all White House journalists.  Conservative TreehouseIn an effort to capitalize on his moment in the sun, today 56-year-old Brian Karem runs to the Associated Press and claims Sarah Sanders and Sean Spicer (White House Press Secretaries) are  bullying him  and not giving him enough respect:AP   The reporter who accused White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders of inflaming the public against the media at a press briefing says he did it because he s tired of being bullied by the administration. There s a time and a place for everything and the time has come to stand up and be counted,  Karem told The Associated Press on Wednesday.  I m tired of taking it. I want friendly relationships, but those who want respect, show respect. We have shown that man and shown the administration respect for six months, and all we re getting in return is a lack of respect, derision and bullying. Karem, 56, is not a representative of the large national media organizations repeatedly described as  fake news  by the president. Besides his editing, he writes for Playboy, where his first-person account of the confrontation was posted late Tuesday. Note to Brian Karem: when a woman like Sarah Huckabee Sanders stands her ground and defends a man she respects and admires that s been unjustly accused of wrongdoing, is not called  bullying she s simply not allowing herself to be steamrolled by the bullies in the media BOOOM Sarah Huckabee Sanders advises ALL to watch Veritas Video where CNN producer admits they realize Trump/Russia is a hoax but dont care! pic.twitter.com/tng5DUmKq3   STOCK MONSTER  (@StockMonsterUSA) June 27, 2017",left-news,"Jun 29, 2017",2307
CROOKED DEMOCRAT Congresswoman Corrine Brown Found GUILTY of STEALING Scholarship Money From Children…Blames RACISM For Verdict,"Celebrated Congressional Black Caucus member, and  legend  Corrine Brown would like Americans to believe that stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars from underpriveleged children in her district, and using the money to vacation with her daughter, is not the reason she s been found guilty of 18 counts of fraud and corruption, it s because she is black. Washington Examiner   She partied with Nancy Pelosi, traveled on Air Force one next to President Obama, and cast her superdelegate vote for Hillary Clinton. But on February 9, 2017, Corrine Brown was in federal court for stealing scholarship money from school children.The disgraced congresswoman attempted to defend against charges that she funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars from a non-profit charity, One Door for Education, into her own pocket.After her former chief of staff testified against her, the question was no longer whether or not she s guilty. It s why Democrat brass would continually cozy up to a congresswoman who was so clearly corrupt?From the beginning, Brown s been shrouded in controversy. Shortly after she won election in 1992, the Federal Election Commission accused Brown of violating numerous campaign finance laws. Most notably, she accepted donations from foreign citizens and failed to report the use of a corporate plane. And that s just the tip of the ethical iceberg.A convenient rap sheet, put together last July by the Florida Times-Union, documents every allegation of wrongdoing brought against Brown during her 27-year career. Hollywood couldn t have better scripted some of the highlights.In 1998, Brown cashed a $10,000 check from Rev. Henry Lyons, the disgraced president of the National Baptist Convention who spent five years in federal prison for fraud. The congresswoman said tthat she used the unreported money to bus her supporters to an event.In 2000, Brown battled back a House Ethics investigation into her efforts to free imprisoned West African millionaire Foutanga Dit Babani Sissoko from federal prison. She appealed to Attorney General Janet Reno for help, asking her to spring Sissoko from prison. Though unsuccessful, Brown received a new Lexus worth $50,000 for her trouble.And in 2008, Brown took heat from the mayor of Jacksonville after she had sandbags delivered by the city to protect her home from Tropical Storm Fay. The congresswoman eventually pledged to pay the city $886.But none of this dissuaded Democrats from palling around the Florida woman. It s mind boggling that Brown not only fundraised with the president but also enjoyed prominent perches on the Transportation and Veteran Affairs Committees.First Coast News   On Thursday, November 16, 2017, the former Jacksonville area Congresswoman Corrine Brown took the stand, and plead for mercy from federal judge Timothy Corrigan. I am sorry you have to be here today to see me in this situation,  Brown said in her statement to the court.  I never imagined I would one day be in court asking people to speak on my behalf   never. In hindsight, I wished I had been more diligent in overseeing my personal and professional life The idea that some people could believe these charges hurt me because it runs contrary to everything I ve ever believed and done in my life. I hope and pray these proceedings to don t make them [ordinary people] lose faith in the system. I humbly ask for mercy and compassion. Brown was convicted on 18 counts of fraud and corruption in May.The lead prosecutor in the sentencing hearing argued Thursday that the former congresswoman should be sentenced to about 7.5 to 9 years in federal prison. Her defense attorney is seeking probation and community service.Brown s defense attorney James Smith objected to various aspects of the sentencing recommendations, including how much money Brown should be culpable for.Prosecutor Duva asked the court,  What accountability does the law require?  during his presentation.Duva said Brown was accustomed to receiving money she should not have received. She also lied about donations to colleges, churches and other entities.He also argued that Brown has made ludicrous comments during the investigation, including a comment where she essentially said that had investigators not been looking into her case, the Pulse shooting in Orlando would never have happened. She also referred to the charges as  bogus  and  racist,  implying that she was targeted for her race in the case.Duva objected to that notion by saying,  She was targeted because she committed fraud, not because she was black or white. Corrine Brown had several witnesses come forward Thursday in support of her through witness testimony during the sentencing hearing.Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee provided a glowing character witness of Corrine Brown during her sentencing hearing Thursday.Jackson Lee described via telephone testimony it as her  privilege  to characterize Corrine Brown as a  loving person. She said Brown has had a  pointed and direct effort [in] helping others, not herself. The veterans  community loved Congresswoman Brown, Jackson Lee said, stating that Brown has helped those with PTSD and other issues following fighting overseas. She also stated Brown helped tremendously with relief efforts during Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. That shows a character of giving to others unselfishly,  Jackson Lee said.Additional arguments by defense attorneyThe defense attorney belabored the point that they are against the notion that Brown abused a position of trust, which is established by the evidence presented in the trial.Smith explained the definition of obstruction of justice, which Brown is accused of doing while taking the stand by the prosecutor, stating that it is the  intention or deliberate effort while on the stand to make material falsehoods. The judge wasn t so sure and asked the defense attorney to elaborate.Smith appeared to get emotional after posing two questions:  What type of sentence does justice require in this case?  and  How do you sentence someone who is a legend? He attributes some of her actions to the progress our country has made in terms of relations for black people.Smith said he met with an Orlando attorney who was from Jacksonville and said the attorney described Brown as  our Martin Luther King  for black Jacksonville natives. None of those people had to push the boulder up the mountain like she did,  said Smith, referring to others in Congress.  She truly is a legend. There are a lot of moving parts in the case against Corrine Brown and her co-conspirators.Carla Wiley first became involved in the fraud scheme when she started dating Ronnie Simmons.She was president of a charity called One Door for Education, which was never actually registered as a 501(c)(3).The fake charity received more than $800,000 in four years, with about only $1,200 of it actually going to scholarships for students. That money is now gone.Simmons was dating Wiley when he told her he needed a nonprofit to financially back a reception for congresswoman Brown in 2012. Wiley offered One Door for Education as an option for that reception.The charity claimed to give scholarships to poor and underprivileged children seeking the become teachers.Lead prosecutor A. Tysen Duva argued during the trial that Ronnie Simmons worked under Brown and did her bidding by taking out $800 a day from the One Door for Education bank account and depositing it into Brown s personal bank account. He did this numerous times, according to Duva and evidence released earlier this month.The fake charity was essentially used as a slush fund for Corrine Brown s travels, expenses and shopping, according to the prosecutors.She used the money put in her bank account to go to Nassau, Bahamas with her daughter, fly to Beverly Hills and shop along Rodeo Drive, and attend a Beyonc  concert, according to court documents and previous reports by First Coast News.The prosecutors also argued that Brown committed wire fraud, mail fraud and stole money from the government after she lied on tax documents.Brown had friends in high places, such as former CSX CEO Mike Ward. She would ask them for donation to Open Door for Education and many of them gladly donated, according to previous reports and prosecutor testimony.Ward, for instance, contributed $35,000 to One Door for Education after learning that the money would go toward providing students with iPads for learning.Prosecutors also argued that Brown lied about and inflated what she gave in tithes to various churches. The churches came forward in the trial and said the donations claimed to be given by Brown did not match their records, to which Brown said she sometimes gave anonymous donations.Other legitimate scholarship organizations came forward and said they had never received funds from Brown s charity.Meanwhile, Brown s tax returns claimed she contributed as much as $30,000   20 percent to a third of her income, to various charities.",politics,"Nov 18, 2017",8961
SINS OF SOCIALISM…Doctors Pumping Air Into Infants Lungs By Hand…No Antibiotics…Children Die In Filthy Venezuelan Hospitals,"Only the strongest will survive in the dog-eat-dog world of Socialism. This is the result of a society that believed the government is more capable of running their lives than they are. This is Bernie s world. This is the reality of the utopia Bernie has been promising his supporters. These are the same policies Hillary is promising she ll support if she s able to escape federal prosecution before the election. By morning, three newborns were already dead.The day had begun with the usual hazards: chronic shortages of antibiotics, intravenous solutions, even food. Then a blackout swept over the city, shutting down the respirators in the maternity ward.Doctors kept ailing infants alive by pumping air into their lungs by hand for hours. By nightfall, four more newborns had died. The death of a baby is our daily bread,  said Dr. Osleidy Camejo, a surgeon in the nation s capital, Caracas, referring to the toll from Venezuela s collapsing hospitals.The economic crisis in this country has exploded into a public health emergency, claiming the lives of untold numbers of Venezuelans. It is just part of a larger unraveling here that has become so severe it has prompted President Nicol s Maduro to impose a state of emergency and has raised fears of a government collapse.Hospital wards have become crucibles where the forces tearing Venezuela apart have converged. Gloves and soap have vanished from some hospitals. Often, cancer medicines are found only on the black market. There is so little electricity that the government works only two days a week to save what energy is left.At the University of the Andes Hospital in the mountain city of M rida, there was not enough water to wash blood from the operating table. Doctors preparing for surgery cleaned their hands with bottles of seltzer water. It is like something from the 19th century,  said Dr. Christian Pino, a surgeon at the hospital.The figures are devastating. The rate of death among babies under a month old increased more than a hundredfold in public hospitals run by the Health Ministry, to just over 2 percent in 2015 from 0.02 percent in 2012, according to a government report provided by lawmakers.The rate of death among new mothers in those hospitals increased by almost five times in the same period, according to the report.This nation has the largest oil reserves in the world, yet the government saved little money for hard times when oil prices were high. Now that prices have collapsed   they are around a third what they were in 2014   the consequences are casting a destructive shadow across the country. Lines for food, long a feature of life in Venezuela, now erupt into looting. The bol var, the country s currency, is nearly worthless.The crisis is aggravated by a political feud between Venezuela s leftists, who control the presidency, and their rivals in congress. The president s opponents declared a humanitarian crisis in January, and this month passed a law that would allow Venezuela to accept international aid to prop up the health care system. This is criminal that we can sit in a country with this much oil, and people are dying for lack of antibiotics,  says Oneida Guaipe, a lawmaker and former hospital union leader.But Mr. Maduro, who succeeded Hugo Ch vez, went on television and rejected the effort, describing the move as a bid to undermine him and privatize the hospital system. I doubt that anywhere in the world, except in Cuba, there exists a better health system than this one,  Mr. Maduro said.For entire story: NYT sMuch like the drooling college students who are turning out by the tens of thousands to  Bernie Sanders rally s in the United States, the citizens of Venezuela elected the controversial Nicolas Maduro as their president, and now they are paying a very heavy price.  BBC  While he lacks the magnetism followers of Mr Chavez attributed to the late president, he is a commanding figure in Venezuela, and not just because of his stature of (6ft 3in).Derided as a poor copy of his mentor, Mr Maduro has not been ousted by the opposition or by rivals in his own party, as some had predicted when he was elected in April 2013.However, he has failed to win over the opposition after sticking very closely to the fiery rhetoric of Mr Chavez.Tough stance His government s tough approach to mass anti-government protests in the first half of 2014 and the jailing of thousands of demonstrators prompted criticism from human rights groups and sanctions from the United States.His opponents paint him as a ruthless despot who detains his political rivals on overly harsh charges pressed by a judiciary under his party s control, while his followers say he is protecting the country from another coup.But with oil prices plummeting below $50 ( 33) a barrel, Mr Maduro s approval rating has been falling, too.Venezuela s economy is almost entirely reliant on its oil exports and the president is facing a severe economic crisis as well as a hostile opposition.And with financing for the government s generous social programs in jeopardy, some are questioning how committed those who voted for Mr Maduro really are to the socialist cause and their leader.

We know that they pay for some of the travel BUT most of the travel is on us. The known total expense to the American taxpayers thus far for all Obama travel is now $70,880,035.78! Here s a list of the FIRST FAMILY VACATIONS WITH THE COST FOR EACH: OBAMA FAMILY VACATIONSWhy doesn t Barack go alone since this sounds like a business trip? At least he ll be able to show his girls the horrible results of decades of communism come to think of it, it might be worth it!First Lady Michelle Obama and daughters Sasha and Malia will be joining President Barack Obama next week on his historic trip to Cuba.Obama will open his visit late on Sunday by touring cultural sites in Old Havana along with Michelle, Sasha and Malia. Cardinal Jaime Ortega will also host the Obamas at the Havana Cathedral.The President then plans to use a speech in Havana to lay out a vision of greater freedoms and more economic opportunity in Cuba, White House officials said on Wednesday, offering a glimpse of how the President hopes to use his trip to encourage change on the communist island. Obama s speech on Tuesday at the Grand Theater of Havana will mark a moment that seemed unimaginable only a few years ago, before Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro moved to restore relations between the two estranged countries.Obama s advisers said they hoped Cubans would be able to watch the speech live on television, adding that Obama sought not to dictate outcomes but create the space for Cuba to change on its own.  Ultimately he will make clear that that s for the Cuban people to decide,  said Ben Rhodes, Obama s deputy national security adviser.  We have great confidence in the ability of the Cuban people to do extraordinary things.  During his three-day trip to Cuba   the first to the country by a sitting president in 88 years   Obama will also meet with Castro at the Palace of the Revolution and attend a Major League Baseball exhibition game.His much-anticipated meeting with Cuban dissidents will include prominent members of the government s opposition, Rhodes said, stressing that the United States and not Cuba was deciding who would attend. The President will lay a wreath on Monday at the Memorial to Jose Marti, the Cuban independence hero, before meeting with Castro in his offices along the famed Plaza of the Revolution. The White House said human rights, regional issues and ways to improve Cubans  standard of living were all on the agenda, with the leaders expected to address reporters after their meeting. Obama planned to meet with US and Cuban entrepreneurs in a bid to boost Cuba s nascent private-sector economy. Castro was to host the President for a state dinner at the palace on Monday evening.Despite Cuban leaders  view of such meetings as interference in the island s internal affairs, Rhodes said there was no reason to believe the government would block any invitees from participating.  If there are any impediments to that meeting we would be very clear about this,  Rhodes said. He declined to name any of those who would attend. Dozens of US lawmakers, including a handful of Republicans, will travel with the President to Cuba along with US business leaders and some Cuban-Americans, officials said, arguing that their inclusion reflected growing support in the United States for lifting the generations-old embargo. Yet there are few signs that Congress will agree to repeal the sanctions anytime soon. Following his Cuba swing, Obama will travel to Buenos Aires to meet with new Argentinian President Mauricio Macri, who took office in December pledging to reverse many of the policies of his predecessor, Cristina Fernandez. Obama has said that Fernandez s policies were  consistently anti-American  and praised Macri for recognizing that  we re in a new era.  In Argentina, Obama will meet next Wednesday with Macri at the Casa Rosada presidential office before laying a wreath and touring the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral. He ll also hold a town hall meeting with young people before being feted at a state dinner. He planned to visit the picturesque city of Bariloche in Argentina s Patagonia region on Thursday before returning to Washington.Read more: Daily Mail",politics,"Mar 17, 2016",4496
PARENT FURIOUS AFTER 4TH GRADE CLASS JOINS HATEFUL PROTESTORS AND TEACHER IN CHANT ON CAPITOL STEPS: “[Governor] Walker Sucks!”,"The children were greeted at the Capitol steps in the communist state of Wisconsin by protestors singing hate songs with signs that read: Republicans and Walker rape or molest women and girls.APPLETON, Wis.   I don t frequent the Capitol building in Madison so I just assumed the  Capitol Singers,  a group protesting Governor Scott Walker in song had faded away.I learned recently however that they are, as a line censored out of the sitcom  Last Man Standing  said of the Clintons,  They re like shingles; just when you think they are gone, they pop back up. I received an email recently from a listener to my radio show who chaperoned a field trip his daughter s 4th grade class at Horizons Elementary School in Appleton took to the State Capitol in late May. The story he shared was simply stunning:Everyone on the field trip to the capitol was eating lunch on the capitol steps. At the same time there was a group of people protesting Walker and Act 10 singing hate songs and holding up signs saying that Republicans and Walker rape or molest women and girls.Another parent pointed out to me that my daughter s teacher was down there singing with them. I thought that I needed to find out what was actually being sung down there because a bunch of students were down there listening and recording on their cell phones what was happening. That is when I realized that they were singing terrible hate songs against Walker and what the signs said.By the way, her teacher was holding a piece of paper with the words they were singing on it. When the kids were on their way back up they started chanting  Walker sucks  and some other mean things. That s when I stopped them and asked why they were doing that and they didn t know what to say. I asked three times and one of the boys spoke up and said that Mr. Niquette was just doing it also. That is my daughter s teacher.Feeling it inappropriate to confront the teacher in front of children, the parent contacted the school to see if such behavior violated school policy. He ended up in an email exchange with the teacher, Scott Niquette:Scott, my issue is you going down there and singing with those people on the field trip.Did you see the signs they were holding? I m guessing that you saw the words you were reading off the sheet you were holding. Do you understand what the children were doing after they saw you down there singing? Scott there is video of you singing that hate Walker song.When the kids were walking back up the hill they were chanting hate speech toward Walker until I stopped them and asked them why. The answer was obvious. Someone with influence in their lives was doing the same thing. You have influence on these children and they trust that you will lead them.

5-YR OLD CHRISTIAN GIRL Forced To Live With Non-English Speaking Devout Muslims…Tells Her Christmas and Easter Are Stupid…Takes Away Her Crucifix,"A white five-year-old girl told her mother Christmas and Easter are  stupid  and European women are alcoholics after being fostered to two Muslim families, it was claimed today.The child, who is a native English speaker, also refused to take back her favorite meal   spaghetti carbonara   because it contained bacon   which Muslims do not eat.The child, who is a native English speaker, spent the past six months in two Muslim households after being placed into foster care in Tower Hamlets, east London.She was forced to live in Muslim foster homes where nobody spoke English and her carers took away her Christian cross and encouraged her to learn Arabic, according to The Times.Local authority reports describe how the little girl sobbed and begged not to be returned to her niqab-wearing carer s home, telling a social worker:  They don t speak English. The reports detail how the child was  very distressed  and claimed the foster carer had removed her Christian cross and encouraged her to learn Arabic.The two placements were made by the scandal-hit Tower Hamlets borough council against the wishes of the girl s family.Local authorities are required to give due consideration to a child s religion, racial origin and cultural and linguistic background  when placing them into a foster home.The girl s mother is said to be horrified by the circumstances her daughter has been placed in.A friend told the newspaper:  This is a five-year-old white girl. She was born in this country, speaks English as her first language, loves football, holds a British passport and was christened in a church. She s already suffered the huge trauma of being forcibly separated from her family. She needs surroundings in which she ll feel secure.

Police Commissioner Explains Why It’s Hard To Hire Black Cops In NYC,"It sounds like a perfectly legitimate reason it s likley NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton has claimed it is hard to hire more black cops because  so many of them  have spent time in jail. We have a significant population gap among African American males because so many of them have spent time in jail,  he told The Guardian.  And, as such, we can t hire them. Partially to blame for the pool of eligible officers that is  much smaller than it might ordinarily have been  is the NPYD s controversial stop and frisk policy that was shut down in 2013, said Bratton.The NPYD commissioner said stop and frisk had  unfortunate consequences  as it resulted in a number of young black men receiving summons for minor misdemeanors.Stop and frisk, which allowed police to question and potentially search someone if they had so-called  reasonable suspicion  that person was committing an offense, was ruled unconstitutional in August 2013 by Judge Shira A Scheindlin.Scheindlin said the program was a violation of both black and Hispanic people s right to equal protection, as they were being stopped at much higher rates than those who were white.Both demographics made up 84 percent of the people who were stopped by officers using the policy, according to a report by the Public Advocate s office and cited by the Washington Post.Fifty-three percent of that figure was made up of black people.Black recruits made up only 6.86 percent of this year s police academy, according to another Guardian report, in a city where they represent 22 percent of the population.The NYPD stopped supporting the policy when Bratton returned as commissioner in 2014, after serving in Los Angeles.But he continued to defend a policy he had New York adopt in the early 1990s, dubbed broken windows, which some of his critics say is where the the real blame should lay.Robert Gangi, the director of the Police Reform Organizing Project in New York, said stop and frisk was not at the heart of the problem but a symptom of broken windows   blatant racist policing .Via:UK Daily Mail ",left-news,"Jun 10, 2015",2052

 Trust Fund Frat Bro Explodes At Uber Driver In Foul-Mouthed Fit Of Entitlement (VIDEO),"The spoiled son of a New York millionaire went full affluenza on an Uber driver, calling him a  minimum wage f*ggot  on camera in a fit of privilege that has to be seen to be believed.As Heavy.com reports:Jake Croman, son of New York City landlord Steven Croman, is seen in a video verbally harassing Uber driver Artur Zawada after Zawada canceled a ride on the University of Michigan frat bro.The video was posted on March 23 and quickly went viral with more than 300,000 views.In the video, Croman, a member of Tau Kappa Epsilon, is seen berating Zawada along with frat brothers. But Croman is the ringleader of the harassment, calling Zawada a  f*ck  and a  f**got.  He continues,  You wanna kick me off? Kick me off, you little piece of sh*t. You re an Uber driver! Go f*cking drive, you little f*ck!  He then proceeds to call Zawada a  minimum wage f*ck  before storming off with his cronies.The footage is astonishing because it lays bare the sense of entitlement and privilege of these trust fund frat bros. While their wealth is no more than an accident of birth, they strut about as if they invented the light bulb. Worse, they actually scoff about the fact that Zawada will spend the rest of the day working while they sit on their a** and watch TV. Newsflash fellas: Zawada is worth ten of you.But clearly, these are values Croman and his cronies learned at home. According to the NY Daily News, the frat bro s father has been branded a  slumlord,  found to be  using illegal tactics to force out rent-stabilized tenants. His latest scam, reports Crains New York, is to undertake highly disruptive renovation works in efforts to force out tenants, making way for those he can charge higher rents.Little wonder then, that his son shows so little respect for his fellow New Yorkers.Croman s fraternity, Tau Kappa Epsilon, has released a statement announcing their own investigation of the incident. It reads: At the conclusion of our swift, thorough investigation, we will handle the situation with appropriate action, Depending on the details of the investigation, this could include the expulsion of membership. Something tells us that this is not going to be enough to correct Croman s attitude. An attitude which stems from an unacceptable wealth gap, which rewards this spoiled boy s father for abusing those without the financial clout to fight back.Featured image via screengrab",News,"March 29, 2016",2394
“ALT-LEFT” PROFESSOR Makes Outrageous Claim: Flag-Burning Antifa ‘Preserving Fabric of America’ [Video],"Political grandstanding has become a blood sport It s obvious that the CNN anchor set up the question so Dyson s answer could be to  slaughter  our president with his words shameful! Professor Dyson and Mitt Romney (who supports Antifa) are CLUELESS!Dyson:  This man is lethally ignorant, incapable of even having a kindergartner s comprehension of race. For those who say look, the confederacy is about history and heritage, it is. The history and heritage of racism! The history and heritage of bigotry. Building their sense of biological and in many cases theological and national identity upon a lie, a mythology of white supremacy. The belief that some people are inherently superior and some people are inherently inferior.For the president then to defend the actions against taking down Robert E. Lee, or Stonewall Jackson   remember, these people hated America enough to want the secede from it. The people that we claim, black lives matter, the antifa movement and so on, are interested in preserving the fabric of America. Mr. Miller says again, that there was violence there, but the problem is to equate that violence in reaction to the bigotry, with the bigotry itself is to misunderstand the fact that when you go to cancer treatment, the radiation is tough treatment, but it is meant to remove the cancer.So what he fails to understand and what the president especially fails to understand is that you are complicit with the worst currents of bigotry in this country when you try to draw a false equivalence between secessionists, racists and confederate defenders and bigots and Neo-Nazis and African-American and white people and others who have defended the rights of this nation to really seek a path of healing beyond the consternation we see now. That s the problem with this president, he ain t got the right moral vision, he doesn t have the right words to express that moral vision and he lacks an understanding of American history. This is the most illiterate, incompetent president in the history of this nation and it shows and it tells on him in the midst of this racial crisis where he is incapable of showing basic decent compassion for those who are vulnerable and who are victims of white supremacy in this country.

" The Senate Banking Committee Held An Equifax Hearing, And The Monopoly Man Showed Up","Remember when half of America had their credit information compromised during the Equifax data breach? Over 143 million people were affected by the largest banking hack ever recorded.

SIX FACTS ABOUT Sheriff Joe Arpaio Case That Will Shut Down Every Liberal Crying “Foul” Over President Trump’s Pardon,"Attorney Dario Navarro was one of several leftists who were all of a sudden concerned about the  constitutionality  of President Trump s actions.If Trump issued pardon with specific intent to obstruct justice, it could be challenged as unconstitutional abuse of discretion. #Dems pic.twitter.com/1p9981yyMD  Dario Navarro (@darionavarro111) June 15, 2017Even the New York Times, who helped to sell Barack Obama s horrific Obamacare plan is concerned about Sheriff Joe Arpaio s pardon.Good case for #ArpaioPardon to be considered unconstitutional.Of course, we'd need a congress with a spine first https://t.co/8Z5M1rVr8u  Dimitri (@DimitriWillert) August 26, 2017On July 25, 2016,  America s Sheriff  Joe Arpaio was found guilty of misdemeanor criminal contempt without the benefit of a jury of his peers.Here are a 6 interesting facts that Breitbart News laid out, regarding the Sheriff Joe Arpaio case, that every American crying  foul  over President Trump s pardon yesterday needs to know: The US District judge who tried the case against Sheriff Arpaio was a Bill Clinton appointee. 1. The guilty ruling, by Bill Clinton-appointed U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton, is the latest chapter of a nearly decade-long saga of legal proceedings against Sheriff Joe initiated by leftist groups opposed to his aggressive policing of illegal aliens.The charges against 85 year old Arpaio stem from a civil rights suit demanding he cease  racial profiling  in his Maricopa County Sheriff s Office s immigration enforcement operations. After a federal judge issued an order demanding certain practices, Arpaio was charged with contempt for continuing to try to enforce the law as he saw fit.The misdemeanor charge was a ploy to prevent Sheriff Arpaio from having a jury trial. 2. Because Arpaio was charged only with a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum of six-months in jail, the U.S. Constitution does not guarantee him a right to trial by a jury of his peers. Arpaio and his attorneys repeatedly petitioned for a jury, only to be denied by Judge Bolton in March and again in May. Sources familiar with the proceedings have told Breitbart News the decision to charge only the misdemeanor was likely a ploy by federal prosecutors to avoid a jury trial in the community where Arpaio served as sheriff for more than 20 yearsAccording to the NCPD President, the DOJ had no evidence to make their case against Sheriff Arpaio.3. National Center for Police Defense (NCPD) President James Fotis, who was present in the courtroom, was highly skeptical a Phoenix jury could have ever found Arpaio guilty. He told Breitbart News:I sat through three days of testimony and it was clear from the beginning that the DOJ had no evidence to make their case. In fact, all of the DOJ s witnesses made it clear that Judge Snow s order was unclear and ambiguous. There is no way a jury would have determined that the Sheriff willfully and intentionally violated the judge s order. Judge Bolton s ruling has caused me to lose my faith in the court system and the federal judicial system,  Fotis added in a NCPD press release.Over 40,000 signatures were gathered on a petition by current and former law enforcement officers in support of Sheriff Joe Arpaio who they claimed spent his entire career upholding and defending the Constitution. 4. Fotis was hardly the first or only commentator to question the impartiality of Arpaio s prosecution. In June, his group managed to assemble over 40,000 signatures from current and former law enforcement officers in support of Arpaio, delivering them to the Department of Justice in Washington, DC.  After devoting 56-years of his life to upholding and defending the Constitution, Sheriff Arpaio deserves our nation s eternal gratitude   not jail time,  those petitions read.The Judge in the case should have recused himself, but refused to do so. 5. The initial racial profiling suit that eventually led to this conviction also took on political dimensions and its conduct was criticized. The judge in that case, G. Murray Snow, ignored calls to recuse himself based on the fact his brother-in-law is a partner at Covington & Burling, the firm representing those suing Arpaio and the Maricopa County Sheriff s Office.President Obama spent much of his 8 years in office trying to find a way to take down America s toughest Sheriff on illegal immigrants, who also headed up an independent investigation into the alleged fake birth certificate that would prove Barack Obama was not born in the United States. 6. The decision to criminally prosecute Arpaio was taken while the DOJ was run by Attorney General Loretta Lynch. It would be highly unusual for new leadership to intervene and drop an ongoing prosecution, and no such step was taken, despite the aforementioned petitions. ",politics,"Aug 26, 2017",4793
 Conservative Dream Come True: Judge Grants Rapist Joint Custody Of Victim’s Child,"If Republicans have their way, rape victims will continue to be terrorized by their rapists.The victim was only 12 years old when Christopher Mirasolo raped her and impregnated her. Despite also threatening her life, Mirasolo only spent six months in prison, only to spend four more years in prison for sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl.That being said, Mirasolo should NOT be allowed anywhere near a child and should still be rotting in prison.But a Michigan judge has decided that Mirasolo should have joint custody of the child his victim gave birth to eight years ago.According to The Detroit News, county officials surveyed the victim s use of food stamps, aid she relies on to take care of her eight-year-old son.For some reason, the county connected her to Mirasolo and a DNA test was taken. It appears the county was searching for a reason to kick her and her son off the food stamp program so they did all of this without her consent.Well, despite the fact that Mirasolo is the victim s rapist, Sanilac County Circuit Judge Gregory S. Ross gave him joint custody of child, ordered the victim to move back to Michigan, and gave her address to Mirasolo.In other words, Judge Ross just put a woman s life in danger and endangered a child.And by giving Mirasolo joint custody, he is allowing a rapist to continue terrorizing his victim. I think this is all crazy,  the victim told The Detroit News.  They never explained anything to me. I was receiving about $260 a month in food stamps for me and my son and health insurance for him. I guess they were trying to see how to get some of the money back. Her attorney is also rightfully pissed off.This is insane,  attorney Rebecca Kiessling said.  Nothing has been right about this since it was originally investigated. He was never properly charged and should still be sitting behind bars somewhere, but the system is victimizing my client, who was a child herself when this all happened. And the same scenario could play out across the nation if Republicans have their way. House Republicans recently passed a bill banning abortion after 20 weeks and you can be damn sure they will keep trying to ban abortion entirely, with zero exceptions for rape victims. That means rapists will be able to seek joint custody in order to make their victim s lives a living hell. Imagine having to interact with the person who raped you and having to hand your child over to them.It s a terrifying scenario that no rape victim should have to face. Conservatives are constantly telling us that rape victims should carry these pregnancies to term because the baby isn t to blame. But as long as rapists are able to pursue custody and terrorize their victims for the rest of their lives, women should never lose the right to choose. Because no one should be forced to live their life in terror and fear.Featured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"October 7, 2017",2891
" With Zero Liability, A Gun Was Just Made To Look Like This Toy (IMAGES)","When you re given a free pass by the government to pretty much make whatever you want with no responsibility if something devastating were to happen because of your product, you d probably make whatever the hell you wanted with no remorse. After all, profit is more important that human life, right? At least, that s what the government is telling gun manufacturers with the  Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. The law,  prohibit(s) civil liability actions from being brought or continued against manufacturers, distributors, dealers, or importers of firearms or ammunition for damages, injunctive or other relief resulting from the misuse of their products by others.  With one of the reasons for the law literally being,  To prevent the use of such lawsuits to impose unreasonable burdens on interstate and foreign commerce.  In other words, they don t want any silly lawsuit to get in the way of profit.On paper, it may look like it makes sense to not hold gun manufacturers liable for how their product is used. After all, it s not their fault if a gun is not handled properly or used to harm someone else. However, what so many fail to see is the fact that with no responsibility it gives gun manufacturers a free pass to basically make whatever they want, regardless of public safety. If they can make it, people will buy it, and after that, well, they re off the hook.So, with all that being said, gun manufacturer Precision Syndicate, LLC made a gun for a client to look like the gun from Nintendo for the game  Duck Hunt.

If only they could use that  common sense  know-how to think twice before making a gun that looks exactly like a popular toy that children would want to play with.Now, say this gun were to get into the hands of a child for any number of reasons. This gun manufacturer is essentially off the hook, because assuming it functions properly and has no mechanical faults that cause injury, if someone were to just use the gun, the maker has no liability according to the law.There will certainly be people who disagree that gun manufacturers should have liability over how their product is used, but when something is made that so obviously could be mistaken for a toy, a toy that a child could point and shoot, there needs to be better  well regulated  standards to guns. After all, the Second Amendment was written for the intent to arm the state militias, not so gun enthusiasts can have firearms that look like toys or so that gun manufacturers can make as much profit as possible.Featured Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images",News,"April 11, 2016",3993

 Trump Trolls Turn On GOP Moderates: ‘You’re Gonna Get Primaried’,"Believe or not,  moderates  do exist in the Republican Party. To those of us on the left, they hardly seem moderate, but they certainly aren t like, say, the Ted Cruz s of the world. In the House of Representatives, they even have a name. They call themselves the Tuesday Group. And since Donald Trump took office, it has been Republicans from that group who have been pushing back the hardest on Trump s more extreme and cruel policies. To that end, it should come as no surprise that Trump s band of trolls in his base are threatening the people in the Tuesday Group with primary challenges in 2018.At the top of the Trump trolls  list of targets is Tuesday Group co-chair Charlie Dent (R-PA). They re letting Rep. Dent know that his days are numbered in the most public of ways   by holding a huge event where they blasted their warnings to him from a park in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Adam Gingrich, who gives political advice to hard right politicians said to Dent: You re gonna get primaried. This particular rally is just the beginning. These people seem to be ready to primary anyone who has been critical of Trump and his agenda from the right. There s just one problem with that, though: They don t seem to understand some of these districts. In a place like Pennsylvania, Ted Cruz-style policies will not fly. These people have to be more moderate than say, members of the ultra conservative Freedom Caucus or they don t get elected and re-elected. There s that, and the fact that most of them seem to at least be attempting to appear reasonable. Despite these facts, though, word has leaked out that Trump himself went after Rep. Dent in a private rant, saying that Dent is destroying the Republican Party. So, as they are likely to do, the Trump Trolls came out in force on Friday in order to back their orange man up. Northampton County GOP Chairwoman Gloria  Lee  Snover said of Rep. Dent: I looked Charlie Dent in the eye and I saw the swamp. In times past, I ve supported Charlie Dent as the only alternative. But now, with his disregard and disrespect to my president   I will no longer be able to support Congressman Dent. For the first time, we finally are going to have primary challengers we can get behind. So, in other words, fall in lockstep with Trump or get out. Rep. Dent, to his credit, is pushing back, though. He says of the situation: I have repeatedly made it clear that on issues such as reforming the VA, making the regulatory environment more reasonable, improving America s infrastructure, providing necessary funding to help meet the needs of our military and spurring economic growth, I will work constructively and supportively with President Trump.

 BREAKING: Comey Just Shut Down Trump’s Tweeted Lies In REAL TIME During Hearing (VIDEO),"On Monday, while FBI Director James Comey and NSA Director Mike Rogers sat through a grueling, hours-long hearing, Donald Trump was busily thumbing his way to oblivion on Twitter   but some of his tweets got fact-checked in real time.The Donald leaped on an opportunity to speak up for his friend Vladimir Putin when both individuals explained that they did not make an assessment whether or not Russian interference influenced our electoral process The NSA and FBI tell Congress that Russia did not influence electoral process. pic.twitter.com/d9HqkxYBt5  President Trump (@POTUS) March 20, 2017Unfortunately for Trump, his claim that the two members of the intelligence community confirmed that Russia did not influence our election was a lie   and he got fact checked just a little later in the hearing. Asked if the tweet is accurate, Comey explained that they have  offered no opinion, have no view, have no information on potential impact because it s never something that we looked at. This, of course, has been the FBI and NSA s position from the beginning and it has not changed. It it shameful that Donald Trump would attempt to misrepresent testimony in this way.

 Bernie Sanders Rocked 3 Rallies In Florida Yesterday,"Yesterday, Senator Bernie Sanders swept through North Florida, holding rallies in Gainesville, Tampa Bay, and Kissimee (outside of Orlando), with turnouts in each rally exceeding 5,000 people each. I attended the rally in Gainesville. I know that Florida is a big football country, right?  Senator Sanders told the crowd in Gainesville, home of the University of Florida Gators.  But unless you are on the playing field, football is a spectator sport. Democracy is not a spectator sport. In Florida, voter turnout, especially for Democrats, is a big issue. There are more than 300,000 Democrats registered in the state of Florida than Republicans. Despite Democrats consisting of the majority of voters in the state, Republicans hold majorities in the State Senate, State House, the Governorship, and 17 out of 27 congressional districts. A Florida Democrat, besides U.S. Senator Bill Nelson, hasn t won a statewide election since Alex Sink was elected CFO in 2006.The rally in Gainesville was filled with all sorts of different people. A trio of Native Americans dressed in traditional garments sat in one of the rows in front of the press box. College kids screamed with excitement as though they were at a Justin Timberlake concert. Veterans cheered with signs of support. A local punk band warmed up the crowd in anticipation for Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard to introduce Senator Sanders. At the end of Sanders  speech, supporters stormed towards the stage desperately trying to get a selfie with Bernie or at least get close enough to shake his hand.Normally, this excitement is reserved for Justin Bieber concerts or NFL football games, but all over the country apathy and disenfranchisement from the American political system is losing out to Americans, young, old, and every demographic in between, getting excited about having a voice, and being heard on issues that affect us all. Whether you are a Bernie Sanders supporter, a Hillary Clinton supporter, or like them both, what Senator Sanders  presidential campaign has done for the Democratic Party by not only rejuvenating progressive ideals, but inspiring voters to actively participate again, is something every Democrat can take pride in.

Authorities Allowed NYC Chain Migration Terrorist To Stop Interrogation Several Times To Pray After Admitting He Was Triggered By CHRISTMAS Posters,"The poor little ISIS-inspired, chain migration, snowflake, terrorist can t even walk by a Christmas poster without being triggered. How long before Mayor DeBlasio starts the dialogue about removing triggering signs of Christmas from NYC, so as not to offend non-Christians? The taxi driver behind the failed terror attack in a New York City told investigators he meant to detonate his homemade pipe bomb in the busy subway station after seeing the walls festooned with Christmas posters   in revenge for violence against Muslims all over the world.While initial reports suggested the crude pipe bomb, made from a pipe, a 9-volt battery, match heads, sugar, Christmas tree lights and screws, had detonated prematurely, suspect Akayed Ullah, 27, insisted he set off the bomb deliberately.Ullah, who was arrested and taken for questioning after the bomb only partially detonated, told police he was walking through the underground tunnel at 7.20am, between the Port Authority station towards Times Square, when he saw the Christmas-themed posters on the wall, which reminded him of ISIS  calls last month for militants and lone wolves to attack holiday markets.  He acknowledges he purposely set it off then and there,  a senior law enforcement official told the New York Post.The Bangladeshi immigrant added that he was specifically inspired by ISIS,  not Al-Qaeda .Authorities say that if the explosive had fully detonated in the busy Midtown Manhattan subway station, there would have been more injuries and doubtless loss of life.The attack came days after Ullah s Brooklyn neighbors say they heard a huge row coming from his home, reporting yelling and screaming over the past two nights.Ullah, who was allowed to stop and pray multiple times during his interrogation, was taken to Bellevue Hospital to be treated for serious burns and lacerations to his abdomen and hands but is expected to survive. At the hospital, the Brooklyn resident told investigators that he was inspired to carry out the attack by the recent flare ups between Israelis and Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.Monday s attack was the first terror attack on U.S. soil since that proclamation, but only one of many violent demonstrations across the world since the controversial move was announced last Wednesday. It was also the second time in two months that New York City was the target of a terrorist attack.President Trump said in a statement that  lax  immigration policies were to blame for the attack, and urged Congress to  enact legislative reforms to protect the American people .Authorities say Ullah took the A train subway to the Port Authority Bus Terminal stop Monday morning, and started walking east towards Times Square via an underground terminal when a pipe bomb hidden underneath his clothes prematurely exploded. Law enforcement officials don t believe the passageway was the intended target since the  low-tech  bomb   attached to Ullah with Velcro and zip ties   did not explode fully.The chemical explosive appears to have ignited but the pipe itself did not burst. Screws were found at the scene, indicating that they may have filled the pipe and were intended to be used as shrapnel.In the end, Ullah was the only one seriously injured by the explosive (three others reported to hospitals for ringing in the ears and headaches).

 Keith Olbermann Drops TRUTH BOMB About Trump And Electoral College — Time For Them To Do Their Job,"Ever since Donald Trump came on the scene, famed political commentator Keith Olbermann has been on a tear with one mission and one mission only: To warn Americans of the dangers of a Trump presidency. During the campaign, Olbermann had a show on GQ s YouTube channel called  The Closer.  Now that Trump has won, his efforts are called  The Resistance. In Olbermann s latest piece, he reminds us all what Alexander Hamilton said regarding the creation of the Electoral College in the Federalist Papers. In short, Hamilton s creation was largely an effort to be a safety valve of sorts, a check on the worst impulses of the public when it comes to choosing a president. Hamilton said of the Electoral College: The process of the Electoral College affords a moral certainty, that the office of the president will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications. In other words, Hamilton created that government body to remedy precisely this situation. In that spirit, here is what Keith Olbermann has to say on the matter, first quoting Hamilton: Nothing was more to be desired than that every practicable obstacle should be opposed to cabal, intrigue, and corruption. These most deadly adversaries of republican government might naturally have been expected to make their approaches from more than one quarter, but chiefly from the desire in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils. How could they better gratify this, than by raising a creature of their own to the chief magistracy of the Union? Then, Olbermann himself says: If the Electoral College is still not what Hamilton described, it is still what Hamilton intended. It is there to weed out the unqualified, the unprincipled, the merely famous. And especially to weed out  a creature  of foreign powers. Or, in Donald Trump s case, all of the above. That s just the thing. The Electoral College was never meant to be nothing but a formality and only a rubber stamp; quite the opposite, in fact. The meeting of the electors after the November election is supposed to be a serious deliberation on the qualifications of the president-elect. If they deem that person unfit, then the electors have not just the authority, but the patriotic   and indeed Constitutional   duty to install a person qualified for that office.Olbermann continues, this time turning to the confirmed Russian interference in our 2016 electoral process, with the clear intention   and eventual success   of electing Trump: Would it be an act of victory over the Russians who committed an act of war against us by interfering with our election? Would it be defense against Trump and this banana Republican government of his which will turn the world over to Vladimir Putin and, oh by the way, end our democracy? Before you answer that, answer this: We can t have Clinton, Alexander Hamilton is dead, and the alternative is an unelected dictator. Would you now trade Donald Trump for a President Mitt Romney, a President John McCain or a President Evan McMullin? Me? In a heartbeat! You re damn right I d take any of those three over Trump. As much as I d rather have Hillary, I ll take Romney or McCain gladly   and I d especially love McMullin, since he s been busily sounding the alarm on how dangerous Trump is this entire time. He is reasonable and would do a good job. Further, he isn t an extremist, just a run of the mill conservative.In short, Olbermann is right. It is time for the Electoral College to stop being a rubber stamp, and to do their job. They all know that Trump is unqualified, and therefore should not assume the office of the presidency.Watch the video below:It s as if 83,549 days ago Alexander Hamilton saw Trump coming and provided the way to stop him with HRC as the hero pic.twitter.com/lBCaVnXy3o  Keith Olbermann (@KeithOlbermann) December 15, 2016Featured image via Frederick M.

ABC News Suspend Anchor Brian Ross Over Fake News Report on Trump-Flynn ‘Russian Collusion’,"After 18 months of rampant speculation over Trump and  Russian collusion  and alleged  Russian hacking  in the 2016 election, in a cloud of non-stop, 24/7 fake news being generated by CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS, Washington Post, New York Times, LA Times, as well as notorious MSM fake news outsourcing agencies like The Daily Beast   the Never Trump Resistance has yet to present a single item of evidence to justify their year and a half-long political witch hunt.In this sea of delusion, there are still a number of desperate media persons who are willing to punt on a contrived plot or narrative   hoping that theirs will be  the one  to finally nail the embattled President on grounds for impeachment beyond a reasonable doubt. Already a number of mainstream journalists, including three reporters from CNN, have been fired or let go as networks are now fear legal repercussions from their new normalized practice of lying and inventing plots about the White House and  Russian meddling. This week saw another high-profile casualty, ABC s Chief Investigative Correspondent Brian Ross, as the  resistance  continues to launch blind media attacks on the President.On Saturday, ABC News executives announced that star anchor Ross would be suspended for one month without pay over an alleged  botched   exclusive  implicating former national security adviser Michael Flynn.Clueless: ABC s Chief Investigative Correspondent Brian Ross.During Ross s live  special report , an invented story-line was fed to a clueless Ross which claimed that Flynn would testify that Donald Trump had  ordered him  to make contact with Russians about foreign policy   while Trump was still a candidate in the general election.According to FOX News, the fake news report  raised the specter of Trump s impeachment and sent the stock market plummeting. Later in the day, ABC issued a  clarification  to Ross s report, saying that Trump s alleged directive came after he d been elected president. Ross himself appeared on  World News Tonight,  several hours after the initial report, to clarify his error.Afterwards, ABC News tried to justify the fake news release, claiming that Ross  report  had not been fully vetted through our editorial standards process. Clearly, Ross took one for the team (The Resistance) here, as anyone who works in media will know. He would have been fed the bogus report by news producers, before doing what mainstream media news anchors do everyday of their careers   unwittingly reading whatever words are scrolling down his teleprompter.ABC News statement went on to try and gloss over their fake news report saying,  It is vital we get the story right and retain the trust we have built with our audience. News officials then sounded even more ridiculous as they scrambled to pave-over their propaganda practices claiming that,  These are our core principles. We fell far short of that yesterday. What s clear from this story is that when it comes to all things Trump and Russia, the US mainstream media feel they are within their right to dispense with all normal journalistic standards so long as the story falls in line with a specific political agenda.Unfortunately, this is just one more reason to always be cautious when trusting watching mainstream media reporting of any any major news event.READ MORE ABOUT MAINSTREAM FAKE NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Fake News FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE   SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV ",Middle-east,"December 5, 2017",3433
WHY DID HARRY REID LIE ABOUT THE “ACCIDENT” He Had That Left Him Blind In One Eye?,"Dirty Harry must ve jarred something in his head that makes him unaware that he s lying in public. He used to be pretty good at hiding it Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) is changing the story about how he sustained those gruesome New Year s Day injuries that have left him blind in one eye.Previously, Reid claimed that an exercise band he was using  broke. I was doing exercises that I ve been doing for many years with those large rubber bands and one of them broke and spun me around and I crashed into these cabinets and injured my eye,  (emphasis added) Reid said at a press conference on January 22.(You can see the video of that press conference here.)But now, in an interview conducted by Fusion (a joint venture between ABC and Univision), excerpts of which have been released today, Reid tells Univision anchor Jorge Ramos that the exercise band  slipped,  rather than  broke. [T]he [elastic band] strap had no handle on it, slipped, spun me around, uh, about, oh I guess four feet (Reid points with his right hand to the wall of the interview room) and so I smashed my face into a cabinet,  Reid tells Ramos.Reid s latest version of the incident, as told to Ramos, differs from previous versions advanced by his team in another very significant way. Sources familiar with the incident said Reid was exercising in his bathroom, with the exercise band attached to the shower door,  Politico reported on January 22. (emphasis added)As Breitbart News reported previously, that version of the story, almost certainly told to Politico by Reid s staffers with his approval, is not credible.Now, however, Reid tells Ramos a different story. The exercise band was not attached to the shower door in his bathroom, Reid says, but was instead attached to  a big metal hook that came out from the wall  in an unspecified room in his new Nevada home.Here s a partial transcript of the excerpt of the interview released by Fusion:Ramos: You said recently that the accident had nothing to do with your decision to retire.However, we are seeing the consequences of what happened.What really happened?Was it really with an elastic band?Reid: Yeah, I had a big, that thick (Reid gestures with his hands), that I had been using for about four years and I was, you know, trying to maintain my, uh, firmness, and, uh, that was my weight training. I was doing that in my new home here in Nevada and a big metal hook that came out from the wall that was hooked there that the strap had no handle on it, slipped, spun me around, uh, about, oh I guess four feet (Reid points with his right hand to the wall of the interview room) and so I smashed my face into a cabinet so hard that uh Ramos: It looked like somebody had hit you.Reid: I am so fortunate that, um, it wasn t over just a fraction of this way and hit me in the temple.Ramos: How s your eye?Reid: I am sightless in my right eye.Watch the full video of the excerpts of the Fusion interview here:Ramos then switched gears and asked Reid about  the most difficult moments of [his] 28 years in the Senate. Ramos failed to ask some key follow up questions about Reid s New Year s Day injury incident.For instance, Ramos failed to ask Reid if the accident took place in his bathroom, as Reid s office had previously claimed. According to Reid s latest version of the story, we do not know in which room of his house he now claims he sustained these injuries.Breitbart News has asked Senator Reid s office, which has carefully controlled the release of information about his New Year s Day injuries, to comment on his changed version of the story of his New Year s Day injuries, but has received no reply.Via: Breitbart News",politics,"Apr 9, 2015",3673

MASS MIGRATION OR INFRASTRUCTURE…CHOOSE ONE: ONE MILLION Imported Every Year While Our Nation Crumbles!,"The truth in the information below is so dead on! We re putting foreigners before Americans by brining in over 1 million every year! Did you know that we have a diversity lottery every year where we allow 50 thousand people to come to the US for no other reason than diversity. We CANNOT keep doing this! Something has to give in our government s effort to flood us with third worlders Here s the story of just one city in America that s the result of mass migration:Anticipating strong population growth, Seattle s urban planners long ago built an impressive 5-lane highway through the city, a 2-lane by-way for the east side and a 3-lane freeway on the west side. Seattle s infrastructure was built to host a growing economic hub and it was built to last. So how is it Seattle today has the worst traffic in America?Infrastructure spending has doubled since the 1990s, yet every election focuses on an infrastructure crisis.In Seattle, many point to new employees of Microsoft and Amazon. Sure, those have an effect. But the real problem is immigration. 14% of Washington is foreign born. How can we ever expect to build sustainable and safe infrastructure when we allow a million people each year to move here?Liberals love infrastructure spending. They believe it stimulates the economy through spending and expands overall economic output, like a well-greased machine. In 2009, President Obama was given $900 billion to rebuild America s infrastructure for the 21st century. Yet, 7 years later, here we are again with Democrats calling for trillion dollar infrastructure packages as if it will once and for all fix our crumbling, overcrowded infrastructure.Liberals long for a distant past of mass immigration leading to economic greatness. They treat America as if it is still a vast, unpopulated frontier where the only infrastructure needed by horse-driven wagon trains is a decent map.A key pillar in Hillary Clinton s infrastructure plan is  Lower transportation costs and unlock economic opportunity by expanding public transit option. Hillary will encourage local governments to work with low-income communities to ensure unemployed and underemployed Americans are connected to good job.  A fine objective. We should provide mass transit options to low income areas, but how can we ever have a satisfactory metro system when low income areas are multiplying in population and area because we invite millions of unemployed, uneducated immigrants? This is yet another example of taking care of foreigners before Americans.Fearing accusations of racism, nobody wants to admit that foreigners are not good drivers. They come from places where traffic laws are ignored, and they bring that culture with them. Native Seattleites are good, safe drivers who don t break 5 miles over the speed limit and are far too passive aggressive to honk. This isn t a genetic or race issue, it s a cultural issue and the culture almost everywhere outside America is indifferent to extremely aggressive, stupid driving. Just watch the daily Russia s Funniest Dashcam Videos capturing vodka-fueled Fast & Furious driving stunts in heavy traffic.Infrastructure is more than just roads. Think of all the waterways, electrical grids, and internet fibers laid just to keep pace with immigration. That s billions of dollars that could have been spent upgrading existing systems and preventing tragedies like the Flint, Michigan leaded water.Unchecked immigration has skyrocketed water prices, utilities companies can barely maintain consistent service, and there is a housing shortage crisis. And Seattle liberals are completely dumbfounded by these problems. The mayor regularly holds press conferences and the city council organizes investigative committees, but never do they admit the problem is out of control immigration and Seattle s sanctuary city policy.Seattle suburbs once had a great style to them. Houses were unique and in harmony with the very green Seattle geography. Now, all of Seattle is being overrun by soulless, cubist condominium buildings to maximize the use of our extremely limited real estate. Building your own house with a fence and a lawn is no longer part of the American dream in Seattle.Schools also suffer. Seattle has a less than 2 child per couple birthrate, yet our schools are stuffed to the gills with children. Decades ago, Seattle built an excellent system of schools. Tax payers built a system for their children, and now they re being ordered to build a bigger system for the children of Indonesia and Cambodia. Rather than evolving teaching systems, our education energy is spent figuring out how to teach in a school where students speak 18 languages and are offended by the American flag. Teachers are no longer employed for their deep knowledge of pedagogy, but by whether she speaks Spanish or Swahili.Our parks have been completely taken over by immigrants. The ballfield where I learned to field grounders is controlled every day by soccer-playing Somalis. People afraid to schedule their games or practices there because there is always confrontation with people from the country that dragged through the streets of Mogadishu the dead naked bodies of our special forces soldiers trying to give them food.Liberals claim how great immigrants are because they pay taxes. Great, thanks for helping to pay for new infrastructure we need because you came here in waves demanding we upgrade so your daily commute to the Home Depot parking lot isn t slowed down.Sure, some immigrants do pay taxes to help partially cover the cost of new schools need to educate their illiterate children, the roads and buses to shuttle them to and fro, and the anti-gang police task forces needed to monitor their older brothers in ethnic gangs. To liberals, the population of America exists to serve the government rather than our society existing on its own with government to help out here and there, so immigration is inherently good.The choice for America is either mass immigration or a sustainable, healthy infrastructure, not both.Via: Regated",politics,"Aug 17, 2016",6062
 Charles Koch Has The Sads Because He Thinks He Should Have More Influence Over Elections,"Charles Koch, the billionaire CEO of Koch Industries has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on political campaigns because of Citizen s United, but he still thinks he should have even more influence.During an interview with the Financial Times, Charles Koch whined that even as he spends tons of money trying to shape the political landscape to his will he still doesn t have as much influence as he expected to have in 2016.Koch says he presented of list of his wishes to Republican candidates, who basically ignored them, which is why he is pouting now. (It) doesn t seem to faze them much,  Koch said.  You d think we could have more influence. It is hard for me to get a high level of enthusiasm because the things I m passionate about and I think this country urgently needs aren t being addressed. In other words, Koch has the sads because he hoped Republicans would automatically be his puppets and support and enact all of his demands.The billionaire polluter actually gave the candidates a freaking LIST of things he wants them to do if they win the presidency and now he thinks he needs even more influence because the candidates didn t seem to give two shits about it.According to Politico, the Koch brothers are poised to spend nearly $1 billion on the 2016 election, in what should be seen as a blatant effort to buy the White House and Congress.Among the many aims on their agenda is the destruction of labor unions, abolishing the minimum wage, dismantling environmental protection laws, and repealing Obamacare while opposing any effort to bring affordable healthcare to the American people. And those are just a few things that the Koch brothers want to do to this country.Charles Koch attempted a run for president in the 1980s, but he failed miserably. Instead, he decided to focus on buying the government instead.But despite his massive influence on Republican politics, Koch is complaining that he still doesn t have enough power over the candidates. In reality, the American people are the ones who should be complaining about not having enough influence over elections, which the Kochs believe they are entitled to buy.If the Koch brothers are wondering why most of the American people see them as villains, this is why.Featured Image: Flickr",News,"January 10, 2016",2269
 Trump’s Justice Dept. Realizes Prosecuting Woman For Laughing Is Stupid – Drops Case Entirely,"Trump s Department of Justice has finally figured out they re stupid in one instance, at least. Back in January, a member of Code Pink named Desiree Fairooz laughed during Jeff Sessions  confirmation hearing, was charged with disorderly conduct, found guilty, and faced up to a full year in prison for it. A D.C. court tossed out her conviction and set a new trial, but now the DOJ has dropped the case entirely:Here s the Justice Department s notice it s dropping charges against woman who laughed at Jeff Sessions during his confirmation hearing. pic.twitter.com/Dv5vqzxdPA  Dominic Holden (@dominicholden) November 7, 2017Fairooz  own reaction to the news says it all about the stupidity of this endeavor:Just received this,  Governments Notice of Nolle Prosequi  What a relief! Guess they ve got enough  laughing  matters to deal with!  Desiree Fairooz (@desireefairooz) November 6, 2017She laughed because she felt Senator Shelby s overly-syrupy remarks about Sessions alleged record of treating everyone equally were as ridiculous as they sound. Sessions treats people anything but equally and he has a long track record of that. Code Pink s campaign director said Fairooz  laughter was a reflex action more than anything, which actually does make a lot of sense. Fairooz herself didn t mean to actually laugh, but she did say: I felt it was my responsibility as a citizen to dissent at the confirmation hearing of Senator Jeff Sessions, a man who professes anti-immigrant, anti-LGBT policies, who has voted against several civil rights measures and who jokes about the white supremacist terrorist group the Ku Klux Klan. That s the whole problem, though: The Trump administration doesn t want dissent. And while it s true that Fairooz had several prior arrests for protesting, the number of cases publicly brought against dissenters of this administration is absolutely astonishing. This is a victory for all who stand for what s right which is the opposite of what Trump s administration stands for.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"November 7, 2017",2048
"STUNNING BETRAYAL! 43 REPUBLICANS, In Dark Of Night Vote To Approve Obama’s Transgender Bathroom Decree","Who knew a President could do so much damage in one year? Who knew he would have the support of so many Republicans we fought so hard to elect, as our last hope to stop Obama s fundamental transformation of America Many are asking what Republicans plan to do to stop Obama s executive war on culture and religious liberty in pursuit of cultural Marxism. Now we know that not only will this party do nothing to stop Obama, they will use their control of Congress to codify Obama s agenda into law.Late Wednesday night, Republicans allowed a vote on an amendment from Rep. Sean Maloney (D-NY), which codified Obama s executive order 13672 making transgenderism the law of the land. Obama s executive order, promulgated in July 2014, instructed bureaucrats to sever contracts with companies that don t follow the Obama mandated sexual identity agenda. This could include companies that don t allow men into female bathrooms in their private corporate offices. The Maloney amendment to the $37.4 billion FY 2017 Energy &Water Appropriations Bill (H.R. 5055) codified that unilateral act into law.The amendment passed 223-195 with 43 Republicans supporting it. The GOP House just supported arguably the most radical Democrat agenda item in the dead of night.Enshrining Obama s specific edict into law and then passing vanity language reaffirming the general importance of religious liberty is like doing CPR on a dead body. GOP leaders are always twisting arms to get conservative members to vote for bad bills. Somehow we are to believe they were impotent in ensuring  moderate  members (what is moderate about transgenderism?) adhere to the party s platform?The reality is that Paul Ryan has long been a supporter of ENDA (Employment Non Discrimination Act), the legislative vehicle for enshrining transgenderism into law and mandating adherence to its dogma on private businesses. That is why he s been absent in this fight. Moreover, Republicans have failed to allow a single anti-religious bigotry bill to the floor since the illegal gay marriage decision was issued by the Supreme Court, despite the ubiquitous threats against private businesses, states, and private property.Clearly, whipping against this vote was not a priority.Once the Maloney amendment passed with GOP votes, Republicans proceeded to do what they always do so well. They offered side-by-side amendments in an attempt to cover up the damage.They passed the  Pitts amendment  as a second-degree by voice vote to affirm the constitutional importance of religious liberty. Then they passed the Byrne Amendments to reaffirm that RFRA is still in place and the government cannot discriminate against religious individuals. Well, as we all know, the Constitution and RFRA (Religious Freedom Restoration Act) have been in place for the entire Obama administration, yet he is still able to get away with anti-religious bigotry edicts by claiming they don t interfere with religious beliefs.To begin with, this entire spending bill was something that should never have come to the floor. It increased spending and retained a number of green energy programs for a department that shouldn t even exist.Now that leadership has loaded this already sub-par spending bill with transgenderism, conservatives should vote against final passage on Thursday. It s bad enough that a Republican House cannot be used as a tool to go on offense against cultural Marxism and anti-religious-liberty initiatives. To pass a bill placing an exclamation mark on that agenda is unforgivable.Via: Conservative ReviewHere is the list of Republicans who voted to assist Obama in his fundamental transformation of America:Amash (MI)Brooks (IN) Coffman (CO) Costello (PA) Curbelo (FL) Davis, Rodney (IL) Denham (CA) Dent (PA) Diaz-Balara (FL) Dold (IL)Donovan (NY) Emmer (MN) Fitzpatrick (PA)Frelinghuysen (NJ) Gibson (NY) Heck (NV) Hurd (TX) Issa (CA)Jolly (FL)Katko (NY) Kinzinger (IL)Lance( NJ) LoBiondo (NJ)MacArthur (NJ)McSally (AZ) Meehan (PA) Messer (IN) Paulsen (MN) Poliquin (ME) Reed (NY) Reichert (WA) Renacci (OH) Rooney (FL) Ros-Lehtinen (FL) Shims (IL) Stefanik (NY) Upton (MI) Valadao (CA) Walden (OR) Walters, Mimi (CA)Young (IA) Young (IN) Zelda (NY)Via: Conservative Review",left-news,"May 26, 2016",4227
ABSOLUTELY STUNNING VIDEO Shows How One Hacker Can Totally Change The Outcome Of Our Elections [VIDEO],"This video shows the frightening ease with which a hacker is able to completely change the outcome of an election. At the end of the video, Bev Harris, the founder of BlackBoxVoting.org gives a few suggestions about how we can help to fight and identify voter fraud. Please don t let this video discourage you from voting. Not every vote is going to be hacked, and not every precinct is using a GEMS system. If you live in a precinct that has an electronic voting machine, remember you may ask to vote with a paper ballot.Here is the full version of the video that has been shortened (below). The only fault in this video is that Bev Harris is working under the premise that the only people who steal votes are primarily white Republicans.We ve worked as poll challengers in Pontiac, Michigan in a polling place that housed 3 voting precincts. We witnessed unbelievable voter fraud that appeared to be strictly in favor of the Democrat party candidates. Voter fraud is not a Republican, Democrat, Independent, White, Black, Hispanic or Asian issue it s an issue that every American citizen should be concerned about. We should all be willing to take whatever action is necessary to protect the sanctity of our vote. Get involved. Be a poll challenger or poll watcher. Find out if you can be a witness to counting the absentee ballots in your area. Becoming active in thwarting voter fraud has never been more important than it will be in this upcoming election.Here is the shortened version:",politics,"Oct 31, 2016",1491
 Donald Trump Tweets He Is Ready To Hand Putin The Keys To Our Electoral System,"Donald Trump tweeted Sunday morning about his visit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. While most were his standard complaining about the media and trying to bolster his controversial meeting with the Russian strongman, one, in particular, stood out. According to Trump, he s ready to partner, yes, partner, in cyber security. No, that s not a joke.I strongly pressed President Putin twice about Russian meddling in our election. He vehemently denied it. I ve already given my opinion ..  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 9, 2017Um, sure. We negotiated a ceasefire in parts of Syria which will save lives. Now it is time to move forward in working constructively with Russia!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 9, 2017The most notable tweet, though, was this one, which essentially said he s giving the fox the key to the hen house:Putin & I discussed forming an impenetrable Cyber Security unit so that election hacking, & many other negative things, will be guarded..  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 9, 2017And then more deflection: and safe.

Fake News said 17 intel agencies when actually 4 (had to apologize). Why did Obama do NOTHING when he had info before election?  Donald J.

Marco Rubio is raising alarms:While reality & pragmatism requires that we engage Vladimir Putin, he will never be a trusted ally or a reliable constructive partner. 1/3  Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) July 9, 2017Partnering with Putin on a  Cyber Security Unit  is akin to partnering with Assad on a  Chemical Weapons Unit . 2/3  Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) July 9, 2017We have no quarrel with Russia or the Russian people.

Mike Gallagher agrees:Coordinating w/ Russia also risks glossing over serious US concerns re: Russian behavior, such as Ukraine invasion & cyber aggression. 6/10  Rep.

I m sure that Vladimir Putin could be of enormous assistance in that effort since he is doing the hacking,  McCain said, laughing.It is somewhat comforting to know that elections are run by states, not the federal government and they are VERY reluctant to hand over that power. That doesn t mean, though, that Trump isn t going to do everything in his power to assist Putin in taking over our government and our internet.Featured image via Getty Images.",News,"July 9, 2017",3072

NFL’S PHONY PATRIOTISM: US Defense Department Paid NFL DISGUSTING $4.5 Million For On-Field Flag Appearances…Welcome Home Tributes,"Every day, the NFL gives fans another reason to stop supporting them. Although the NFL agreed to refund a small portion of the money our Defense Department (US taxpayers) have paid them to show support for our military, it s the idea that Americans have been duped into believing it was something they did out of honor or reverence for our military. The NFL has reached a new low with their acceptance of players who are disrespecting our flag to promote Obama s race war while disallowing the Dallas Cowboys to honor the 5 police officers slain in their hometown by a Black Lives Matter terrorist. Don t forget, they also looked away when Cleveland Brown s player, Isaiah Crowell posted an Instagram picture of a cop with his neck being slit open. The NFL never said a word. They never even acknowledged what some considered to be a terrorist type threat to our law enforcement.In May 2016, the NFL announced that they would return more than $700,000 of taxpayers  money that was paid to teams for sponsored military tributes.After being criticized for  paid patriotism,  in which money came out of the armed forces budget for various measures of public recognition during games, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said that the league would pay that money back.In a letter written to Senators Jeff Flake and John McCain on Wednesday, and disclosed on Thursday, Goodell said that   following an audited review of 100 marketing agreements from 2012 to 2015 by accounting firm Deloitte & Touche   teams were deemed to have received $723,734 for acts of sponsored patriotism. Given the immense sacrifices made by our service members, it seems more appropriate that any organization with a genuine interest in honoring them, and deriving public credit as a result, should do so at its own expense and not at that of the American taxpayer,  the report said.  Americans deserve the ability to assume that tributes for our men and women in military uniform are genuine displays of national pride, which many are, rather than taxpayer-funded DOD marketing gimmicks.   PGLast year, Flake and McCain disclosed that the U.S. Department of Defense had spent $5.4 million in contracts with 14 NFL teams from 2011 to 2014. Some of those contracts disclosed that payment was for on-field flag ceremonies and tributes to welcome home veterans. One team, the Atlanta Falcons, had made more than $1 million from the department over those four seasons.The National Guard spent $6.7 million on contracts with NFL teams from 2013 to 2015.

"CBS 60 Minutes Withheld Trump’s Appeal to ‘Stop Attacking Minorities,’ and Ignored Reports of Attacks on Trump Supporters","J.R. Smith 21st Century WireThe election campaign might be over, but the mainstream media s campaign against President Elect Donald Trump is in full swing. Between all of the fake polling, intentionally pro-Clinton partisan coverage, and mainstream media collusion with the Democratic National Party and the Clinton Campaign exposed through WikiLeaks  Podesta email dump   nearly the entire US mainstream media is now in full damage-limitation mode desperately trying to preserve any crumb of credibility and perceived authority they might have left.It s now become clear that the media is guilty on multiple fronts, as more proof has emerged of how they are helping to stoke violence, while promoting unfounded fears   and all the while pushing fictional  hate crime  hoaxes.CBS News flagship investigative program 60 Minutes conducted a recorded interview with  Trump on Friday in which he made a direct plea on camera to any possible supporters to  Stop it,  in reference to anyone that may have written racist slogans or abusive language in public, or at schools. In light of the numerous pockets of protests and outbreaks of partisan violence which have racked America since the election results were announced last week, it would have been in the public interest to release this powerful appeal by Trump, but instead mainstream CBS buried it for 3 days until 60 Minutes was scheduled to air later on Sunday evening nationwide. If CBS had any credibility remaining, this certainly will have finished it off.When told about alleged reports of a  Trump supporter  who were said to have been harassing Latinos and Muslims following his presidential win, Trump told interviewer Leslie Stahl,  I am so saddened to hear that.  He then added, And I say,  Stop it.  If it helps, I will say this   and I will say right to the cameras:  Stop it.' One big thing in this incident that many mainstream media observers did not pick up is that at no time did Stahl give any specifics on these alleged  abuses  by Trump supporters against Muslims and Latinos, and even though it s obvious that Trump was not responsible for directing any alleged abuses   Stahl still demanded an apology on their behalf   without offering any evidence to support her claim. This was  drive-by  media at its worst. In fact, not one of these said accusations of abuse have been properly investigated by the media, and some may end up actually being media-generated rumors, or even hoaxes.Now, it s perfectly understandable that Trump s victory over the establishment s heavily inflated candidate Hillary Clinton has left many Democrats, especially millennial college-aged students upset, angry and feeling more than a little delicate due to their bruised collective egos (they are not upset that Trump won, as much as they are upset that  they  lost). The real problem exists far beyond the learned immaturity of America s politically correct-obsessed young adults. The real danger is that Democratic Party gutter operatives and their liberal media cohorts are actually staging, and fabricating hate crime  incidents in order to propagate the idea that the President Elect and his supporters are somehow  causing many minorities fearful about the future .  In reality, much of this hype is being generated through these same liberal media outlets.In fact, one Muslim female from Louisiana has since been forced to apologize for inventing her alleged hate crime  incident   one designed to discredit Trump, and to help stoke more nationwide protests.Buzzfeed reported, via Religion of Peace:A woman who claimed she was attacked and robbed by two men near the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, including one wearing a Donald Trump hat, made up the story, police said in a statement.The woman had alleged the men yelled obscenities at her and took away her wallet and hijab, a scarf sometimes worn by Muslim women, The Advertiser reported.Lafayette Police officials said in a statement the incident is no longer under investigation, the paper reported. During the course of the investigation, the female complainant admitted that she fabricated the story about her physical attack as well as the removal of her hijab and wallet by two white males,  the statement reportedly read.NOTE: This story made national headlines and was not questioned or challenged by the hordes of self-described  journalists  who populate the news and editorial newsrooms of America s corrupt liberal mainstream media.That s right   this was just another hoax:Violent Democratic-Affiliated Street GangsWhat Leslie Stahl and the rest of the gatekeepers at CBS and 60 Minutes have obscured is the fact since Tuesday s election, nearly all of the so-called  violent hate crimes  have been carried out against Trump supporters   by street gangs who are most clearly Democrat Party supporters.Here are just a few examples:@michellemalkin Even high school kids are not spared. Student Trump supporter attacked at Woodside High School https://t.co/e7tVvDJ6O8  Mama Angel (@Mommysaurus75) November 11, 2016Watch this clip taken from the radical leftist Portland protests this weekend, where Democratic Party supports attack a single woman in her car because they believed that she was a  Trump supporter.  These violent incidents reveal the flavor of anarchy which the Democratic Party and the sitting President of the United States, Barack Obama   are condoning through their deaf silence over the multiple reports of street violence unleashed with the help of the Democratic Party s online  community organizer  network MoveOn.org   a digital platform partly funded by leading Clinton donor and billionaire George Soros. Watch this stunning clip: From reports we learned that at no time before the attack took place did Wilcox display any support for Donald Trump. It appears as if they attacked him because he was white. So could one call this a case of black on white racism? Regardless, it s political intimidation done on the street   which could also be defined as pure political fascism. In this instance, the violence was partisan, and carried out by what could be classed as unofficial Democrat foot soldiers   enforcing a type of radical political regime on the streets of America. Watch this disturbing video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7zEibNcejA . Agitator and Chief: Where is Obama?These incidents have been mostly blacked out by a national US media who are obviously still working to discredit the Trump Presidency.Amidst all this violence, however, where is the current President Obama, or the Democratic Party s losing candidate Hillary Clinton   to help calm street thugs and violent  progressives ? It s almost as if Obama and Clinton are enjoying the unrest. Most certainly though, Obama, Clinton and the Democratic Party are hoping to use this week s media-generated liberal angst as future political leverage.What used to be regarded as a reputable investigative news program, 60 minutes, has gradually become a joke. It seems disinterested in covering anything of genuine interest, opting instead for running bland People Magazine and Time Magazine-style  safe  segments. Judging by its plummeting ratings, and its predictable cast of  job for life  government-approved media gatekeeper-cum-commentators like Anderson Cooper and Lesley Stahl, there is little hope for this institution. You might even say it s irredeemable.One of the corporate mainstream s worst offenders during the election was CNN host Brian Stelter (photo, left), whose own show is ironically titled  Reliable Sources.  Stelter is meant to be CNN s media watchdog person, laughably given the lofty title as  senior media analyst.  After leading CNN s own exposed efforts to obscure and derail Trump s Presidential run, while working to cover for a hugely unpopular (even among Democrats) Hillary Clinton candidacy, Stelter has now taken it upon himself to revamp his network s horrible reputation as an establishment gatekeeper and manipulator of US elections. But it s too late. The damage has already been done, and CNN will not regain the hanging facade of credibility it once struggled to retain. They are a dirty media outlet, and now everyone knows it.Now CBS News has been exposed in public view, but their crime is even worse than CNN s which was just dirty politics in comparison. CBS News took it upon itself to compromise public safety, and put lives at risk   all for its own selfish institutional political position. Twenty years ago, this might have been considered shameful, but in today s toxic liberal media establishment ruled by an unhealthy feeling of superiority over the unwashed masses   they are all way past shameless at this stage.None of them can be trusted anymore   only tolerated, in the hope that they might actually report some useful news in the coming years.More on the CBS 60 Minutes scandal from The Hill  COSMETIC: CBS s Stahl represents the shallow, bland irrelevance of the mainstream gatekeeping media. Joe Concha The HillCBS News is under fire for holding a videotaped clip from a Friday interview with President-elect Donald Trump urging supporters not to attack minorities until a  60 Minutes  broadcast on Sunday night. I am very surprised to hear that. I hate to hear it,  Trump told interviewer Lesley Stahl when told of some attacks on minorities that have reportedly occurred since his election victory Tuesday. I am so sorry to hear it, and I say stop it,  Trump said before looking directly into the camera.  And I say right to the camera, stop it. 60 Minutes  did release quotes from the Friday interview in advance, but only a statement by Trump on the Affordable Care Act. We chose to release a quote on the issue that affects the most Americans & that was his statement on Obamacare,  a spokesperson for CBS told CNN Monday.Kai Ryssdal, host of  Marketplace,  called that reasoning  completely underwhelming. CBS's underwhelming answer: ""We chose to release a quote on the issue that affects the most Americans & that was his statement on Obamacare""  Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) November 14, 2016Protests have grown in the wake of Trump s victory in major cities across the country.Not all protests have been peaceful.

 Here’s How Lying Trump Supporters Turned A Random Protester Into ‘ISIS’ (TWEETS),"Donald Trump and his supporters are absolutely crazy. There is video that has surfaced from a rally from this weekend with his supporters doing a Hitler-esque salute and telling reporters to go to Auschwitz, and of course we all know about the outbreaks of racist violence. Well, the one that really takes the case is how Trump and his supporters have managed to make a great part of his ignorant base believe that a protester who rushed the stage is somehow connected the terrorist group ISIS.The protester, identified as 22-year-old college student and activist Thomas DiMassimo, is in no way tied to ISIS. However, Trump and his supporters have plowed on with this ridiculous and untrue theory. Trump was questioned about the spreading of this lie on a recent edition of Meet The Press, when the shutting down of his Chicago rally due to violence was addressed. He gave his usual crazy and uninformed answer, and said,  All I know is what s on the internet. So, we have a guy who literally is winning the race to be a presidential nominee who lies all the time and admits to believing everything he reads online. That s scary as hell, to say the least. He even tweeted out the fake video created by his lying fans:USSS did an excellent job stopping the maniac running to the stage. He has ties to ISIS. Should be in jail! https://t.co/tkzbHg7wyD?ssr=true  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 12, 2016Journalist John Harwood tweeted this ridiculous travesty:Trump response to being told video connecting rally protestor to ISIS is a hoax: ""all I know is what's on the Internet""  John Harwood (@JohnJHarwood) March 13, 2016Of course, we also know that Trump is now threatening protesters with arrests that will  ruin their lives  if they exercise their First Amendment rights against the hateful environment of his rallies as well. His supporters are also still steadily spreading the lie that DiMassimo is an ISIS supporter, though the FBI has thoroughly debunked that claim. The edited video that they used to promote that dangerous nonsense was actually of the young man at a protest that had nothing to do with ISIS. DiMassimo says of his reasons for rushing Trump on stage and taking the disorderly conduct charge: We must nonviolently shut down every Trump rally. We must stop this violent, foolish man from taking this country and destroying it. Thomas DiMassimo is absolutely correct. Trump is America s Adolf Hiter, and the really scary part is that a lot of people are too blinded by bigotry, hate, and fear to see it.Featured image via video screen capture from Addicting Info archives",News,"March 13, 2016",2602
CHICAGO AREA SCHOOLS REPLACING BOOKS BY WHITE MALE AUTHORS With Books That Are “more culturally relevant”,"Because books written by authors like Ernest Hemingway, William Shakespeare, Mark Twain and John Steinbeck are so-o-o-o overrated and so culturally irrelevant Chicago area schools are replacing white male authors on student reading lists with minority and women authors who delve into themes like power, justice, humanity and social responsibility. I think yes, book lists in schools are sexist, but I don t think it s the school s fault,  senior Sarah Eiden told the Gapers Block Book Club blog.  I think it s because we still think good literature is only written by white males, which simply isn t true. I do see though that teachers are trying to change that. New Trier High School English teacher Scott Campbell is among them. When we think about summer reading books or adding a new book to a course, we re often looking for woman or people of color,  he told the site.It s some teachers  way of countering the prevalence of white male authors who penned classics like  The Great Gatsby,   Lord of the Flies,   The Catcher in the Rye  and  Of Mice and Men,  Campbell said. Women a hundred or so years ago were not encouraged or expected that they might write, so we re left with literature that seems unbalanced and institutionalized, almost in the way we talk about racism,  he said. Women haven t been championed as writers generally,  Campbell said.  This is just one of the after-effects of male domination. John Hancock College Prep English teacher and curriculum coordinator Natalie Garfield seems to share Campbell s perspective.She hunts out books that are  more culturally relevant  to students at the school than classic books written by white male authors. At the end of their high school career, a kid can pick up any new book and potentially have been exposed to anything like it based on the wide spectrum of texts we offer here,  Garfield told Gapers Block.  (You) make changes and reflect the times and kids in front of you. Those changes include books like  The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian,  which is actually a fictionalized story about a 14-year-old Native American teen that attends a mostly white high school with themes of alcoholism, sexuality, violence and bullying, according to the blog.Other titles like  Always Running: La Vida Loca, Gang Days in L.A.  focuses on gang life, unemployment, drug addiction, incarceration and suicide. But in the end, it s a positive, uplifting story of a man who realizes his potential as a Chicano activist and artist and manages to turn his life around,  Gapers Block reports.  This book gives readers a raw look at what it meant to be Latino in Los Angeles during the  80s and how community involvement can truly impact marginalized groups. Some student told the site they appreciate that teachers are catering reading lists to their culture by replacing books written by white male authors with minority-penned prose.Hancock senior Lisseth Perez said books on Hispanics offered in the past are from a white person s perspective. We come from a Hispanic culture, but enven when they give us  Hispanic books,  it s more like, just Hispanic people trying to fit into a white community,  Perez said.  It s the same book over and over: Hispanic kid wants to go into the white community and not get looked down upon. It s the same story with women, Hancock junior Sandra Rodriquez told Gapers Block.

 These DISGUSTING Trump T-shirts Are EXACTLY What’s Wrong With His Supporters (IMAGES),"Trump s supporters have proven time and time again that the reason they re able to stand behind The Donald with a completely clear conscience is because they re exactly like him. The pro-Trump crowd is just as Islamophobic, racist, irrational, angry, vulgar and self-involved as the Republican frontrunner himself. The majority of Trump s supporters also share another trait of Trump s   they, too, are misogynists and this couldn t have been more evident than his supporters  choice of attire at a recent rally.While at Trump s campaign event in Syracuse on Saturday, Jill Colvin of the Associated Press managed to snap a picture of this disgusting t-shirt, proudly worn and modeled by one of the candidate s young Trump bros.If you need any more convincing that the  Trump That B*tch  slogan isn t a misogynistic, disrespectful attack on women, just wait until you see what the front says:Misogyny at its finest. Not only was there a completely despicable message on the back of the shirt, but the front makes a disgraceful, tasteless reference to former POTUS Bill Clinton s infamous affair with Monica Lewinsky. There couldn t be a more immature, vile way to disrespect Democratic front runner Hillary Clinton than this.These t-shirts were being sold outside of the event, and it s shameful to think that even one person would buy one. But then again, what else can you expect from someone who believes that Trump is worthy of being the next President of the United States?These people have stood by Trump through every single one of his attacks on women. Not including Trump s extremely long (and forever expanding) history of misogyny, these morons have supported the disgraced candidate through his horrific abortion remarks that stated women should be punished for terminating a pregnancy, his unprovoked attacks on rival Ted Cruz s wife, an incident where Trump s own campaign manager threw a female reporter to the ground (and Trump did NOTHING about it), Trump s one-sided feud with Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly, his awkwardly incestuous comments about his own daughters, and so much more.These people have absolutely NO moral compass between right and wrong, and they ll do anything just to get some attention   just like Trump himself. Trump s misogynistic messages are becoming more and more terrifying, and his followers are going to stand behind him one hundred percent. The GOP has been terrorizing women forever, but Trump s particular brand of hateful rhetoric is especially dangerous. Featured image via Twitter",News,"April 16, 2016",2530
" Did Ron Paul Just Confuse Al-Qaeda With ISIS, Or Does He Simply Not Know The Difference? (TWEETS)","Former Texas Congressman Ron Paul added yet more fuel to the argument that older people should stay away from Twitter when he either confused ISIS with Al-Qaeda or simply proved that he has absolutely no idea what he is talking about in a misinformed tweet on Monday night:Remember: there was no al-Qaeda until our foolish invasion of Iraq based on neocon lies.  Ron Paul (@RonPaul) August 22, 2017One could only wish that the 82-year-old Paul, a man who has run for president three times as both a Libertarian and Republican, and one who also holds a degree in Medicine from Duke University, would be slightly more intelligent, but apparently that just isn t the case. We currently have a President in office who is concerned the with mainstream media spouting  fake news,  yet doesn t call out fellow or former Republicans when they do the exact same thing, however, fortunately there were plenty of people on Twitter who were willing to do so on Trump s behalf.Actually he's right. No Al Qaeda in Iraq before we invaded.  mike nakadai (@cinemiike) August 22, 2017Alzheimer's is terrible.

Wulander (@WuShocks) August 22, 2017Even if we were to give Paul the benefit of the doubt and believe he made a simple absent-minded error, his factually-deficient tweet proves that it is people like him who are the main source of this  fake news  problem. All it would ve taken was a little fact-checking and proof-reading to see the error in his propaganda, but maybe we can clear it up for him if he is able to see the flaw in his tweet, wants to retract the statement, but can t be bothered with the research.Al-Qaeda was founded by Osama Bin Laden, Abdullah Azzah, and other Arab volunteers in the 1980s to fight the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, however, they will forever go down in history for the 9/11 terror attacks, an event that definitely happened before the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. ISIS, on the other hand, achieved notoriety following the U.S. invasion of Iraq, but they still existed before then, founded in 1999 by Jordanian Salafi jihadist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi under the name Jam at al-Taw d wa-al-Jih d and pledging their allegiance to Al-Qaeda in 2004.See, Ron, fact-checking isn t that difficult and it helps prevent opening old wounds, or ones that are still reasonably fresh with the pain still being felt to this day, wounds such as 9/11.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"August 22, 2017",2642
" Trump Is Now Becoming Chris Christie’s Sugar Daddy, And Yes, It’s As Weird As It Sounds","In what is seriously turning into a bromance for the ages, Donald Trump is now apparently turning into New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie s sugar daddy. Instead of a regular old campaign appearance like he s been doing across the nation, at one rally stop in New Jersey at the Lawrenceville National Guard Armory Trump will be charging $200 per person to raise money for Christie s debt from his failed presidential campaign.If that sounds weird, it s because it is. Trump is now doing pretty substantial favors for Christie and it definitely makes one wonder what s up.Political science professor Brigid Harrison from Montclair State University said: This is really unique in its character. This is akin to Hillary Clinton holding a rally to pay off Bernie Sanders  debt, or to Barack Obama holding a rally to pay off Hillary Clinton s debt in 2008. And while it wouldn t be unusual if Trump had thrown a fundraiser for the explicit purpose of helping out Christie, doing so with a rally is found to be very odd by experts.And according to NJ.com: Trump will also appear at a second, private fundraiser Thursday for New Jersey s Republican Party, which still has $525,000 in debt related to legal bills from the George Washington Bridge scandal that engulfed Christie s administration. Tickets for that event: $25,000. Looks as though Trump is really starting to embrace the Republican party and now realizes the need for donations and contributors. All this while he still claims to be an outsider, but looks to be squirming his way into the infamous  establishment  likely noting it s in his best benefit moving forward towards November. He s a businessman and likely sees all of this as some form of deal, because it is. It also makes one wonder what role Christie would have within a Trump administration, because it s becoming more and more obvious that may be the course of action.Who knows, really? And hopefully we ll never have to find out.Featured Photo by Sean Rayford/Getty Images",News,"May 19, 2016",1989
HILLARY BASHED TRUMP For Saying He May Not Accept Election Results: Video Shows Her Telling CNN Host Gore Shouldn’t Have Conceded 2000 Election Results,"Last night during the third debate, FOX News  Chris Wallace asked Donald J. Trump if he would accept the election results? With multiple stories of voter fraud being committed by Democrats across the nation and a video (see below) proving that the DNC and Hillary s campaign are coordinating with criminals to plan massive voter fraud, why would Trump make a statement that he was willing to accept the outcome of the election regardless of how it may be won? Hillary chastised Trump for having VERY LEGITIMATE concerns over the potential for voter fraud to swing the election. Her admonishment was carried by every mainstream media outlet, but wait what about the Al Gore election result?Here s the exchange:Here s Hillary discussing Al Gore s contested election to CNN s Larry King:  From everything I ve seen and heard, ah  more people did intend to vote for Vice President Al Gore. I hope there still will be an opportunity to have the votes counted. I think that s the best for whoever is inaugurated. Watch Al Gore s announce at a press conference in 2000, that he will continue to contest the results of the election and even suggests the Republicans committed voter fraud in the hotly contested 2000 election against George W. Bush.Al Gore even goes as far as to suggest the GOP prevented blacks from voting (a common Democratic Party tactic). He makes it perfectly clear that he will not concede the election until the Supreme Court makes a decision on the election:And more recently, here is Hillary nodding in agreement with her small crowd of supporters as they chant  You won!  to her featured guest, professional liar and con-man Al Gore:https://youtu.be/xpYwiYvSO8MWatch Jr. Senator Barack Obama suggest the results of the Florida Supreme Court decision on the Bush-Gore election was incorrect (challenging the election results):WATCH this video and then tell us if you would accept the results of the election if the race is close and Hillary wins:",left-news,"Oct 20, 2016",1964

WILL SEXTING By Anthony Weiner Finally Bring Down Hillary Clinton?,"WASHINGTON   Federal law enforcement officials said Friday that the new emails uncovered in the closed investigation into Hillary Clinton s use of a private email server were discovered after the F.B.I. seized electronic devices belonging to Huma Abedin, a top aide to Mrs. Clinton, and her husband, Anthony Weiner.The bureau told Congress on Friday that it had uncovered new emails related to the Clinton case   one federal official said they numbered in the thousands   potentially reigniting an issue that has weighed on the presidential campaign and offering a lifeline to Donald J. Trump less than two weeks before the election.In a letter to Congress, the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, said that emails had surfaced in an unrelated case, and that they  appear to be pertinent to the investigation. Mr. Comey said the F.B.I. was taking steps to  determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.  He said he did not know how long it would take to review the emails, or whether the new information was significant.Donald Trump seized on the F.B.I. action on Friday at a rally in New Hampshire. To cheers of  lock her up  from his supporters, Mr. Trump said:  Hillary Clinton s corruption is on a scale we have never seen before. We must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office. After deriding the F.B.I. for weeks as inept and corrupt, Mr. Trump went on to praise the law enforcement agency.  I have great respect for the fact that the F.B.I. and the D.O.J. are now willing to have the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made,  Mr. Trump said.  This was a grave miscarriage of justice that the American people fully understand. It is everybody s hope that it is about to be corrected. Read more: NYT",Government News,"Oct 28, 2016",1802
 CNN Just TORPEDOED Donald Trump With Facts To PROVE He Lied About Them Again,"CNN is definitely sick and tired of Donald Trump calling them  fake news. During an interview with Erin Burnett on Friday, Bernie Sanders jokingly referred to CNN as  fake news  to mock Donald Trump. Sanders even made sure to let Burnett know that he was just joking and Burnett acknowledged that Sanders was just joking. Soon after, a technical difficulty arose as Sanders could no longer hear Burnett. CNN then went to commercial, and Burnett apologized to the audience and to Sanders for the issue and resumed the conversation.Here s the video via CNN.Well, Fox News claimed that CNN cut off Sanders in retaliation for his  fake news  joke. And then Donald Trump tweeted about it several minutes later and made the same claim.While on FAKE NEWS @CNN, Bernie Sanders was cut off for using the term fake news to describe the network. They said technical difficulties!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 12, 2017That s when CNN proceeded to strongly fire back as Brian Stelter set the record straight by linking to the full video of the interview and call Trump out for lying.Untrue.

Those are the facts. https://t.co/NzJNgdYSIX pic.twitter.com/AOFKLHUlGk  CNN Communications (@CNNPR) February 12, 2017Clearly, Donald Trump once again got  alternative facts  from Fox News and repeated them as his proof that CNN is  fake news. But if he had simply taken ten minutes to watch the actual interview, he would know that Sanders was only joking, and that CNN did not cut Sanders off. It really was a technical difficulty and Sanders was able to continue the interview after the issue was fixed. But Trump didn t bother to do that, and he got his ass handed to him for it.Last week, Trump claimed that CNN host Chris Cuomo failed to ask a guest a specific question, only to get skewered by Cuomo and CNN Communications again for lying. Had Trump watched the very beginning of the interview, he wouldn t have humiliated himself.. @ChrisCuomo did address that point at the start of his interview. Those are the facts: https://t.co/JWJEAshv1y  CNN Communications (@CNNPR) February 9, 2017Donald Trump won t bother to do simple research before he runs his mouth on Twitter, and that means he probably doesn t bother to do any research before making decisions as president.

SAY WHAT? #BlackLivesMatter TEXTBOOKS TO BE USED AS PART OF COMMON CORE CURRICULUM IN GRADES 6-12 [Video],"When will American citizens stop being afraid to stand up and SPEAK OUT against the  politically correct  thugs of the left?A new  Black Lives Matter  textbook will soon be available to middle school and high school classrooms.According to the publisher s description,  Black Lives Matter  covers the shootings that touched off passionate protests, the work of activists to bring about a more just legal system, and the tensions in U.S. society that these events have brought to light. ABDO Publishing specifies that the book was written for sixth graders through high school students, and says the textbook is  aligned to Common Core Standards and correlated to state standards. Until now, no authoritative text designed to teach non-black children about historical-structural inequalities productive of anti-black violence in U.S. law and society has been made available for commercial consumption,  reads a review in The Feminist Wire. Parents as well as teachers eager to teach middle and/or high school students about the routine vulnerability and terror generative of the rejoined,  Black Lives Matter,  will find an invaluable resource in this special report. Conservative radio commentator Larry Elder weighed in on Fox and Friends over the weekend. [The textbook] is indoctrinating young kids, teaching them black people are victims,  Elder said.He argued that the movement would be better off addressing black-on-black crime. If the  Black Lives Matter  people are really concerned, they ought to say something about the fact that last year 6,000 blacks shot other blacks, and far and away the number one cause of preventable death for young black men is homicide,  he added. The textbook was co-authored by Missouri journalist Sue Bradford Edwards and Duchess Harris, a professor of American Studies at Macalester College in Minnesota. Harris is also the author of  Black Feminist Politics from Kennedy to Obama  and a co-editor of  Racially Writing the Republic: Racists, Race Rebels, and Transformations of American Identity. Black Lives Matter  is part of ABDO Publishing s  Special Report  series of books that aim  to help readers develop an essential understanding of current events and encourage them to form their own opinions. There are a total of eight titles in the  Special Report  series, including  Ebola Outbreak,   ISIS,  and  Transgender Rights and Issues.  Via: Red Alert Politics ",left-news,"Aug 24, 2015",2410
 Obama Can’t Stop Winning As New Jobs Report Shows U.S. Economy Still Kicking Ass,"Today, I would hate to be a Republican strategist. Why? Because with the election only 10 months away, I have to tell my candidate that the economy is still growing robustly and shows no signs of weakness. If anything, it still has room for explosive growth even after adding another 292,000 jobs in December:The jobless rate, which has declined since topping the 10 percent mark in October 2009, is now hovering just above what economists consider full employment   the point where further declines could start to push up inflation.The average monthly gain in jobs last year were closer to the 2013 average of 199,000 a month, but short of the 260,000 figure reached in 2014. The remarkable thing is how consistent employment growth has been over the past three or four years,  said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody s Analytics.  We re getting at least 200,000 jobs per month on a consistent basis. That s quite an achievement. The only downside to this report is that there was no growth to average hourly wages. That s been the  slow  part of this slow recovery. On the plus side, once we reach the  full  employment mentioned above, wages will grow and grow rapidly. Companies will be competing for employees and the way to do that is by offering higher pay. This, by the way, is one of the reasons Corporate America has not been all that gung-ho about heating up the economy. High unemployment means low wages, the second favorite phrase next to  Golden Parachute  for CEOs.But, once wages start going up, people will have more money to spend and that increases demand. Increased demand, of course, requires more people to fill that demand and that means more jobs which means more people have money to spend and so the cycle goes. Slowing or reversing this cycle was the express purpose of the Republican s austerity mania in which they insisted pulling money out of the economy would  help  it. A crippled economy is good for Republican political ambitions.Fortunately, Obama fended off most of their bullshit cuts and instead implemented policies to avoid inflating the economy on a fragile bubble. It may have been slow but the Obama Recovery is incredibly stable (did you even know the rest of the world s economy is a mess?) and so far resistant to shocks. If we keep up this pace, Obama will be handing his (Democratic) successor a solid foundation from which to build a bridge to the future.Maybe they can find jobs for all the Republicans that will be out of work come election day?Featured image via Black Water Dog/Pete Souza",News,"January 8, 2016",2545

 5 Reasons The Republicans Just Nominated The Worst Possible Candidate: Trump,"Donald Trump has cleared the Republican presidential field of all the credible (and not so credible) challengers, and is now the presumptive nominee for the same party that produced Teddy Roosevelt, Abraham Lincoln, and Ronald Reagan. It is amazing.But in picking Trump as their nominee, the Republican Party has chosen a candidate with a binder full of negatives, so many negatives in fact that it is highly unlikely he can overcome enough of them to win the presidency.Here are 5 of the reasons.70 percent of women in a recent Gallup poll have a negative view of Donald Trump. That s because Trump has a long record   including in this campaign   of attacking women. He s called them pigs, talked about their bathroom habits, complained about their periods, and on and on.Women are the majority of American voters, and Republicans have lost that demographic for years. Even when they have won the presidency, they ve lost with women.And while it isn t all she is, Hillary Clinton will obviously be the first major party nominee to be a woman. So far, Trump has not reacted well to this, accusing her of playing  the woman card,  with her candidacy, a sexist comment that echoed with millions of working women voters. The Clinton campaign was able to raise over $2 million just by highlighting Trump s comment and giving donors a  woman card  to mark the moment.Mitt Romney was pilloried over his comment that he had  binders full  of women, and he never was half as sexist as Trump has been on an average day.Donald Trump is most unpopular candidate for a major political party basically since polling was invented. Trump has an average of 60.6 percent disapproval!That is unheard of going into the party conventions, where candidates are usually a blank canvas before attack ads start to fly in the fall. But Trump is one of the most well-known people in America, and what America has seen   it doesn t like.President Obama nearly coasted to national electoral victories in back to back elections with a diverse, young, electorate. And while Hillary Clinton has had trouble connecting with younger voters in the Democratic primary, Donald Trump is the best positioned candidate to motivate the Obama coalition against him.He polls poorly with women, minorities, and in a recent poll younger voters indicated that despite their reservations about Clinton, they have near to no interest in Trump.At this point in the 2012 election, President Obama was 3.4 percent ahead of Mitt Romney in head-to-head national matchups. By comparison, Clinton leads Trump by an average of 6.2 percent, and that includes a poll from conservative pollster Rasmussen who got the 2012 election completely wrong.Most other recent polls show Clinton with leads of +11%, +7% and +11%.The New York Times  Nate Cohn explains why this is unlikely to change much:There have been 10-point shifts over the general election season before, even if it s uncommon. But there isn t much of a precedent for huge swings in races with candidates as well known as Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton. A majority of Americans may not like her, but they say they re scared of him. To have a chance, he ll need to change that.Unlike President George W. Bush in 2008, President Obama is unlikely to be a drag on the ticket. In addition to the unusual image of a sitting president campaigning for his party s nominee (Reagan was too ill to do it in 1988, the Gore campaign pushed Clinton away in 2000, and McCain did his best to hide from Bush in 2008), President Obama s approval ratings have inched back up over the last year, often above or near 50 percent.Additionally, the unemployment rate is at 5 percent, after hitting almost 10 percent in the Bush economy, and gas prices have come way down. Polls now show Americans feel good about the economy, after Obama s policies have gotten the country out of the Great Recession (without Republican help).That s good for the party in power, which means it s good for Hillary Clinton, and bad for Donald Trump.Featured image via Flickr",News,"May 3, 2016",4032
CIA INSPECTOR: “Hillary endangered lives” FORMER JUDGE: Hillary Is A “Prime candidate for prosecution”,"Poor Hillary, she s always the victim of some Right-Wing conspiracy When members of Congress are not allowed to see the contents of the emails Hillary had on her private UNSECURED server that s a pretty big deal!The government intelligence in Hillary Clinton s private emails as secretary of state is sometimes considered so sensitive that some congressmen have been hindered in their ability to even read them, a new report Thursday says.The material in the emails is classified at a level above  top secret,  Fox reported, meaning that some lawmakers have been required to sign new agreements not to reveal their contents. The situation highlights the sensitivity of the information that is being pored over, despite Clinton s long habit of downplaying their significance.A level above  top secret  is considered subject to  special access programs,  requiring the additional security because of the increased sensitivity.Congressional reviewers who scoured the SAP information in Clinton s emails already had Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented clearance   the highest level of security clearance   but were required to sign extra non-disclosure agreements.Last week, Intelligence Community Inspector General I. Charles McCullough III wrote senior lawmakers to advise them that  several dozen  additional classified emails have been identified   including specific intelligence from special access programs. In a later interview with National Public Radio, Clinton downplayed the IG letter and claimed it was politically biased.  This seems to me to be, you know, another effort to inject this into the campaign, it s another leak,  she told the network.  I m just going to leave it up to the professionals at the Justice Department because nothing that this says changes the fact that I never sent or received material marked classified.

The Genealogy of Trump’s U-Turn on Palestine,"Patrick Henningsen 21st Century WireHas political reality finally set in for the GOP presumptive nominee Donald Trump?With only days before the Republican Party s National Convention at Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio, presidential candidate Donald J. Trump finally abandoned any pretence of  neutrality  on the Israel-Palestine issue, and is now firmly  committed  to supporting Israeli settlement expansion on territories it has seized illegally, and also not recognizing a Palestinian State.After all the promising rhetoric and previous displays of good will on this crucial foreign policy issue, exactly how did he finally arrive back at the status quo?What started off as interesting, became promising, before eventually settling into Washington s default position. On numerous past occasions during the GOP debate cycle and along the campaign trail, Trump had stated his feelings (which appeared to have an air of passion at the time) and intentions to secure a peace deal for the open-ended Israel-Palestine conflict.The Israeli Lobby started to get very interested in the beginning of December 2015, when during an interview with the AP, Trump seemed to blame Israel for not securing a lasting peace agreement. I have a real question as to whether or not both sides want to make it,  Trump said, before explaining that his concerns predominantly reside with  one side in particular [Israel].  He also hinted that he wasn t interested in any Jewish Republican money, to a chorus of boos he crowed,  I can t be bought . The same for any outside money too. Later, it slipped out again during a nationally televised GOP debate, with Trump making sounds about  negotiating a peace deal. Now here was a true maverick, giving chase to the forbidden cow. Amid all of Trump s wild gaffes and ad hominem attacks, this was an epiphany. At this moment Trump really stood out, and caught the attention   and support   of a whole new legion of disaffected, disenfranchised moderates paddling on the fringe of the Trump wave.That was it. Soon after the phone rang. It was Sheldon.The Donald had been summoned to a one-on-one in Las Vegas with the capo de capo himself, the George Soros of American right-wing politics, the kingmaker, Lord of the Slots and Supreme Master of Macau, billionaire property, casino tycoon and CEO of Las Vegas Sands Corporation, 82 yr old Sheldon Adelson. It was after this time that Trump began to shape-shift on the issue, and not in favor of the Palestinians either.  CAPO de CAPO? Donald Trump and Sheldon AdelsonAdelson, a committed Zionist who has backed numerous successful political careers, including that of Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu, commented on his meeting with the Republican candidate,  He [Trump] had talked about potentially dividing about Jerusalem and Israel, so I talked about Israel because with our newspaper, my wife being Israeli, we are the few who know more about Israel than people who don t. From that point on, began the process of Trump s  rehabilitation  on the Israel-Palestine.On March 10, 2016, there stood Trump, still as the presumptive underdog, at CNN s GOP Debate in Miami   alongside a wall of Republicans candidates who were all firmly in the pockets of the Israel lobby including their emissaries in the US Senate   Lindsey Graham, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Trump s remarks on the illusive peace process could have been considered seminal way back then: I would like to at least have the other side think I m somewhat neutral as to them, so that we can maybe get a deal done. Campaign rival Cruz hit back, questioning Trump s support for Israel saying,  I don t think we need a commander in chief who is neutral between the Palestinian terrorists and one of our strongest allies in the world, the nation of Israel. Everyone, including the media, seemed so shocked by Trump s unorthodox comments that they went near catatonic on this issue afterwords. It was as if Trump had pole-vaulted over the perennial swamp that is the GOP foreign policy platform. The Lobby didn t waste any time however. In the eyes of the wider Israeli Lobby, taking a  neutral  stance or daring to recognize Palestine or Palestinians, is synonymous with attacking Israel and Jews. This is a simple law of political physics in America at the moment and will remain so as long as the lobbyists continue shoveling millions of dollars per month into the pockets of both prospective candidates and elected officials nationwide.Predictably, he was attacked viciously by his opponents, especially Cruz. It seemed as if Trump has broken ranks in a way that was unfathomable for any Republican politician seeking office in the United States of America.Of course, the Israeli press didn t take kindly to Trump s vision of peace and harmony, and from this point onward, pressure began to mount on Trump to conform to the American political orthodoxy on this issue.Soon, Trump was summoned on March 21st, to AIPAC, the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee, where he delivered a resounding speech which seemed good enough for the lobby that night, but the job wasn t finished just yet.Later on in May, Trump continued to evolve, now employing doublespeak on the issue, saying he would still like to negotiate  a deal  but that Israel should keep building illegal settlements in the West Bank of Palestine, and that Israel needs to  keep going  and  keep moving forward.  He stated: I d love to negotiate peace. I think that, to me, is the all-time negotiation I would love to see if peace could be negotiated. A lot of people say that s not a deal that s possible. But I mean lasting peace, not a peace that lasts for two weeks and they start launching missiles again. So we ll see what happens. I think Israel should have   they really have to keep going. They have to keep moving forward [with constructing illegal settlements]. Finally, the penny ultimately dropped. With the GOP s Big Tent event rapidly approaching, Trump s platform on Israel has been fully baked. Sputnik News reports: David M. Friedman, a real-estate attorney serving as Trump s main advisor on Israel, said the Republican presidential candidate and reality television star would not support the recognition of the Palestinian state without  the approval of the Israelis.  Friedman also remarked that Trump was unconcerned with the inhabitants of the West Bank, because  nobody really knows how many Palestinians live there. Trump made Friedman a part of his campaign staff in April, at a meeting with Orthodox Jews, naming him and Jason Greenblatt, another real-estate lawyer and Trump s chief attorney, as his advisors on Israel. Friedman said at the time,  Mr. Trump s confidence is very flattering. My views on Israel are well known, and I would advise him in a manner consistent with those views. America s geopolitical interests are best served by a strong and secure Israel, with Jerusalem as its undivided capital.  Friedman has made no secret of his feelings about a two-state solution with Palestine, writing that,  It was never a solution, just an illusion that served both the US and the Arabs. Another devastating blow to the native Palestinians, currently under military occupation   and backed by the US to the tune of $3 billion per year in direct military aid (free money for weapons and equipment).Against his former declarations to the contrary, Trump is also now accepting outside money, from multiple sources. Funny how the political poles shift. How quickly a raging populist becomes a cynical realist. Even for a self-made billionaire, money still buys friends and influence.With that out of the way, it s finally safe for the lobby to get behind Donald in a general election, should they wish to.There it is.

HERE’S A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF WHY People Don’t Trust Muslims Living In Their Communities,"The massive shroud of secrecy in Muslim communities around the world is what causes people to question the motives of every Muslim. Aren t non-violent Muslims who say they wouldn t report a terror plot as culpable as the radical Muslims who commit acts of terror?  A new ICM poll has discovered two out of three Muslims in Britain would not give the government any information if they knew details about a terror plot.These disturbing poll results seem to indicate the government s counter-terrorism program, named Prevent, is unlikely to provide much usable information on active threats, if it passes along any information at all, The Express reports.The results also suggest the existence of a society deep inside Britain that is fundamentally opposed to its values and will actively subvert the government to protect its own members. Further questions in the survey revealed even more evidence that Muslims diverge entirely from British norms.For example, over 50 percent of Muslims think homosexuality should be illegal. A total of 23 percent of Muslims want Sharia law to become the dominant legal system in the country. Exactly 31 percent are completely comfortable with one man having multiple wives.

 Barbaric Bullies Set Disabled 13-Year-Old Boy On Fire (VIDEO),"Deandre Williams suffers from a disability which causes him to walk with a limp. Because of his condition, his mother says, a group of student bullies routinely picked on and bullied him, even giving him the nickname  limpy. Shortly before Christmas, this same group of students invited the teen to the community center, supposedly to hang out. The 13-year-old then went with the group to the home of one of the student bullies.Once inside the house, one of the students doused him in cologne and then lit him on fire. He was trying to leave, run out of the house but he can t because he can t run. He walks with a limp,  his mother, Ursula Allen, told Fox 5 in New York.According to Allen, there were others in the house at the time the attack occurred, including the mother and the sister of the student who set her son on fire.Although Deandre had severe burns on his face, neck, chest and arm, more than two hours past before anyone attempted to get medical attention for the injured teen. When the sister saw what was going on she covered it up,  Allen said.  She put Deandre in the shower which hurts even more. The teen was later admitted to the hospital in critical condition, due to the severity of his injuries.Here s more on this story from Fox 5.The attack on Deandre Bloomfield took place in Staten Island, New York on December 2nd.During an interview with New York Daily News on December 9, the teen said he thought the boy who attacked him was his friend. He used to bully me. Smack me around,  he said during the interview, which took place in his room at Staten Island University Hospital North.The teen described what happened on the night of the attack. First he smacked me. I got up and I said,  Don t smack me again.  And when I wanted to leave, he picked up a perfume bottle with a lighter, and he sprayed it on me. He did it two times. The first time he did it sparked on me. . . . And that s when I started to run, and he threw the whole bottle at me. His clothes caught on fire.Deandre s attacker, another 13-year-old boy, was not identified by police, due to his age. He was arrested and faces multiple charges.No charges have been filed against the boy s mother or sister, although police say they are still investigating the incident.After spending almost three weeks in the hospital, Deandre was released just before Christmas. Community organizations pulled together to send a message of support and healing to the teen, who also opened an assortment of awesome Christmas gifts, including an xbox one, OVO clothes, gear and more, courtesy of rapper Drake and radio station Hot 97.1.During an interview with the station on January 8, Deandre said he won t be able to go back to school for another few weeks yet. He still has some healing to do. When asked whether he felt safe going back to the same school, he said the students who bullied and attacked him are no longer attending classes there.According to the National Education Association (NEA) bullying impacts more than 13 million students in the United States annually. Every day in the U.S. more than 160,000 kids stay from home school because of bullying.If you think a child is being bullied, the NEA advises against just ignoring the signs, hoping the behavior will correct itself. Instead, the organizations advises adults to intervene as soon as they suspect there is a problem.The NEA says parents should: Take any and all steps to address bullying including getting professional help. And be sure to inform someone in your child s school that your child is being bullied. It s crucial that parents have a contact person in the school whether it be a principal or assistant principal, a teacher or a support staff person. *Featured image credit: video screen capture via Fox 5",News,"January 10, 2016",3770
 Kevin Spacey Predicts What Would Happen If Frank Underwood Ever Debated Trump (VIDEO),"House of Cards star Kevin Spacey, who plays the fictional character President Frank Underwood, sat down with CNBC International on Thursday and just couldn t avoid getting asked questions concerning the 2016 presidential election. Chief among them was a question about what would happen if Donald Trump ever had to debate Frank Underwood.Here is the answer he gave, which drew quite a bit of laughter: He wouldn t (debate Underwood). There would be a terrible accident, on the way to the debate. It would be terrible, and very sad. If that wasn t funny enough, he followed that up with his best Trump impersonation: I m huuuge. I m too huge for this church. Spacey is currently making rounds across the globe promoting the new upcoming season of House of Cards, which airs in March. He was also asked this very same question at the annual SkyBridge Capital reception hosted at a piano bar just a day earlier. He says he often gets asked the question of what would happen if Frank Underwood had to debate Trump,  who would win? I thought about this and I said,  We must remember one important distinction, one of these characters is a fictional character, and the other is a fictional character.' It turns out he s used this line in the past often. Probably the best and most elaborate answer he s ever provided is from a Q & A session with CNN he did back in September. Oh, I think Underwood (would win). He (would win) because he would kill Donald Trump. Trump would never make it to election day. It d be over, done.I think it would be great if Donald Trump started a feud with a fictional character, because maybe for once it would be a fair fight. Perhaps Trump will appear in season 5 of House of Cards next year after he loses the real U.S. election this November. He is, after all, a TV personality. It s not too far-fetched that Trump could be a rival of Frank Underwood one day.Featured image via screen capture.",News,"January 23, 2016",1921
" Trump Lashes Out At Puerto Ricans, Calls Them ‘Ingrates’ In Self-Congratulatory Tweets","Again, these are AMERICAN citizens he is talking about.If Donald Trump had treated Texas and Florida the way he is treating Puerto Rico right now, there would be riots in the streets and massive protests in front of the White House.But apparently, people don t seem to understand that the people of Puerto Rico are American citizens who should be given the same respect and treatment that Texans and Floridians received after hurricanes slammed their states.Trump has not done that so far. Not only was he too slow in responding because he focused more on trying to force NFL players to stand during the national anthem, he has not sent nearly enough troops or equipment or supplies to Puerto Rico. And he is insulting them to add insult to injury.Trump has taken to Twitter to constantly brag about the recovery operation despite his response being worse than President George W. Bush s response to Hurricane Katrina. Puerto Rico was devastated by two Category 5 hurricanes, yet less water and food has been sent to the island.When Trump s administration tried to frame the disaster as a  good news story,  San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz fired back by pointing out that people are dying. Trump threw a temper tantrum in response and suggested that Puerto Ricans are lazy people who won t help themselves.On Sunday morning, Trump lashed out again. While bragging about the recovery effort as if it s the best recovery effort in history, Trump congratulated himself and called Puerto Ricans who criticize the weak effort  ingrates.

WOW! Kellyanne Conway’s “MISTAKE” Forced Leftist Media To Expose What REALLY Happened In Bowling Green…And The TRUTH About These Iraqi “Refugees” Is P.R. Nightmare For The Left [VIDEO],"President Donald Trump s Senior Counselor Kellyanne Conway clarified a comment in which she mistakenly referred to a  Bowling Green Massacre. She said Friday on Twitter that she meant to say  terrorists  instead of  massacre,  referencing a 2013 ABC News story on two suspected terrorists living as refugees in Kentucky.According to the story:  The discovery in 2009 of two al Qaeda-Iraq terrorists living as refugees in Bowling Green, Kentucky   who later admitted in court that they d attacked U.S. soldiers in Iraq   prompted the bureau to assign hundreds of specialists to an around-the-clock effort aimed at checking its archive of 100,000 improvised explosive devices collected in the war zones, known as IEDs, for other suspected terrorists  fingerprints. An undercover FBI operation exposes Al Qaeda terrorists posing as refugees in the middle of the American heartland. They quickly learned the laxed background checks were to blame. But it turns out that may be just the beginning. There may be dozens more now in this country as well.The video below shows an admitted Al Qaeda terrorist who had already killed American soldiers in Iraq, trying to get weapons to kill more of them. And Authorities tell ABC News he may be just one of dozens of men with American blood on their hands where mistakenly allowed to settle in the US as refugees.The two men came from Iraq 4 years ago among tens of thousands of refugees who the State Department approved to come here, seen as  no threat to the US . But the two were in fact, as the FBI says part of an Al Qaeda connected insurgent group that had already killed American soldiers with road side bombs.

#Hashtag Hell & The Fake Left," By Dady Chery and Gilbert MercierAll writers with a desire to rattle people out of their torpor occasionally wonder if it is worthwhile to continue to try to raise their voices over the din of lies and distractions.More and more for us, such thoughts are occasioned, not by the mainstream, which predictably treats all the pronouncements from the powerful as being newsworthy, but by the fake left, which lobotomizes most of whom it touches. The increasing sophistication of this group and its rate of expansion are astounding. Its purpose is to annihilate and replace the real left, and it is making great strides in this regard.The real left includes those who, like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (MLK), came to realize that quantum leaps are the way to proceed, rather than tiny incremental change. The real left does not curry favor or approval from those in power; it challenges the social status quo and respects the inherent right of an injured and indignant population to rebel against authority. It is not for rent or for sale, and it does not cave in to power. Martin Luther King March (Image Source: Wikicommons)By contrast, the motivations of the fake left are money and fame: the preservation of their place in their ivory towers, together with all the trimmings of an upper middle class or wealthy lifestyle. For them, the path is smoothed and the wheels of the machine are oiled for lucrative book deals, speaking tours, radio and television interviews, and articles that are infinitely reverberated through approved sites in the Internet. Their spokespeople channel political ideas toward electoral cycles and transform revolutionary musings into banalities, paralysis, and futile actions. They attack the public s thought process itself and engender an attention-deficit disorder. Ideas are not pursued, shared, honed, and acted upon but instead displaced by fleeting slogans like  hope and change,  or  feel the Bern. Alternatively, the ideas are muddled, branded and labeled with names like  shock doctrine,   disaster capitalism,  or  climate capitalism,  so that they may be put away and no longer examined. An important function of the fake left is to diffuse legitimate, spontaneous defense. Righteous anger is made to give way to confusion, and the impetus to revolt is transformed into the futility of virtual actions. Slogans are used as vaccines to prevent the contagion of dissent. Thoughts, not quite fully formed and the beginning of spontaneous actions, like blockage of bridges and highways, quickly dissipate. They are aborted into quick visual scans of an image or rapidly associated with a few words, like  black lives matter,  and then shared on social media. Today, Thomas Paine s Common Sense would not kindle a revolution; instead it would be quoted, posted, pinned, and tweeted. The fake left is a decoy: a hunter s trap to break the leg of any possible revolution. One of the fake left s godfathers is the multibillionaire George Soros, who obviously believes that wealth equals wisdom and has come up with a clever model to launder his vast financial gains into global political influence. Soros has developed an extremely diversified portfolio of intellectual properties and non-governmental organizations (NGO) in more than 37 countries. Artists throughout the world who present their people as victims, and promote passivity and despair, are rewarded with support and prestigious prizes. Supported organizations like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International are accused not only of selectively collecting data on human rights abuses but also of exploiting some of those data to pressure countries into policy changes that are unrelated to human rights. Independent  journalism is a major focus of Soros  Open Society Foundation, which was founded in 1993, soon after the collapse of the Soviet Union and right before the explosion of the Internet. When US-friendly corrupt governments, and US-sponsored institutions like USAID and the United Nations are exposed by the real left, Soros-sponsored think tanks and news organizations like the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) spring into action and become the voice of reason, demanding that these organizations self-reform. Countless others, also related to the Open Society Foundation, echo and amplify their message. Dismantlement and profound systemic change are never on the agenda. In most of the world, and especially the US, elections are staged, with the primary goal being to let off steam from targeted sectors of the population. A secondary goal is to make a rigged political process appear believable and give the impression of a free exchange of ideas. The candidates are presented as caricatures that trigger an emotional identification in specific groups of people. In the US in 2016, the mean, misogynist and racist ugly American stereotype is served well by Donald Trump for the right. On the other side, the reincarnated Occupy leftist champion of social justice is played by Bernie Sanders. Nonetheless it is Hillary Clinton s turn to win. Trump and Sanders serve to keep the elections in the news and to make Clinton the only supposed pragmatic choice. The ambition of Sanders to beat Hillary Clinton is questionable in light of the fact that he did not run for the presidency in 2012, although the issues were the same, and he could have benefited then from the energy of Occupy. Sander s platform is a reactivation of the Occupy themes. Occupy, however, is not what it used to be. Indeed it is a perfect example of something from the real left that was hijacked. It began as a leaderless anti-capitalist movement called US Day of Rage, but soon it acquired leaders like Chris Hedges, and its most radical elements, like the Black Bloc anarchists, were vilified and excluded. The fake left poaches the narrative of the real left so as to kill it. Outright plagiarism and abundant appropriations and rewrites are hallmarks of the fake left.  Since it lacks a heartfelt leftist rhetoric, it must continually borrow one, ironically, to excoriate it so as to present a superficial version of it. Any critical examination will show that the self-proclaimed firebrands of the left have, for decades, never moved the revolutionary dial an iota. If books like Noam Chomsky s Occupy or Naomi Klein s Shock Doctrine, or Chris Hedges and Joe Sacco s Days of Destruction, Days of Revolt had been genuine, they would have brought people to the barricades in the streets, and there would surely have been attempts to suppress them. Instead the books have been celebrated and glorified by the media establishment, because these pseudo-radical manifestos have not brought action but paralysis.The latest offering by Naomi Klein, This Changes Everything, will, by design, change absolutely nothing at all, except the balance of her bank account. TOAST OF THE LEFT: Author Naomi Klein.Those few of us who are genuinely trying to change the course of events sometimes wonder how we can compete against this powerful new machine that appropriates our message, twists it, and then blasts a degraded version of it through countless bullhorns. Doesn t the public realize that wealth and fame are not the normal trappings of revolutionaries? Don t people know that revolution is never easy, and that if it appears to be, it is not real? If words like earth, nature, life, democracy, dissent, protest, love, and revolution are allowed to lose their weight, our voices will go the way of the song of the extinct Dodo bird. It is imperative that these words be reappropriated and reinfused with meaning.Revolutionary talk cannot be permitted to become an exercise in futile venting or a validation of passivity; to mean anything at all, it must be enacted in community.Dady Chery is the author of We Have Dared to Be Free, and Gilbert Mercier is the author of The Orwellian Empire.

 SHAME: Proof Trump Doesn’t Care About Military Veterans,"Donald Trump has often invoked the U.S. military and treatment of military veterans while he has campaigned as the Republican presidential nominee. But time and time again, when it comes to actions and deeds, Trump s behavior is that of someone who doesn t really care at all.The latest evidence of that comes from reporting on how he behaved while attacking the family of Captain Humayun Khan, the soldier who died protecting his unit in Iraq in 2004. Trump responded to the Khan family s speech during the Democratic Convention by attacking the family, but now we are learning just how ignorant Trump was while he was involved in this smear.New York Magazine s Gabriel Sherman reported on Saturday that when one adviser warned Trump he had just attacked a Gold Star family, the GOP nominee responded  what s that?

SHOCKING POLL RESULTS In Primary Victories Tonight,"There are no surprises with the results on the Republican side tonight. Michigan and Mississippi went for Trump.BUT the Democrat results coming in tonight are surprising for many reasons. The most shocking is that Bernie Sanders is leading Hillary Clinton in Michigan by a little over 3%:Clinton has maintained a double-digit lead in nearly all polls of Michigan, the party s second-biggest state in terms of delegates to vote so far. But Sanders has visited the state repeatedly in recent weeks, believing its economically hard-hit areas should be receptive to his message of combating economic inequality. If he can pull out a surprise victory, his campaign team believes, it will quiet the naysayers questioning his viability after Clinton s sweeping wins in last week s Super Tuesday contests. It would also allow him to argue that he s a truly national candidate, while most of Clinton s big victory s have been in the south.Another shocking item is that exit polls in Michigan said 60% of Democrats believe Hillary Clinton is honest and trustworthy Wow! That s a crazy exit poll!Michigan Presidential Primaries ResultsOverall Michigan Presidential Primaries Results Democratic 36.7% Reporting B. Sanders 51.7% 217,424 H. Clinton 46.5% 195,306 10Republican 36.3% Reporting Winner D. Trump 37.2% 200,388 J. Kasich 25.6% 137,866 T. Cruz 23.6% 127,403 M. Rubio 9.1% 48,905 One of the inside baseball items that s interesting is that we re hearing many Democrats in Michigan crossed over to vote for Kasich to try and defeat Trump. Interesting because Hillary is losing to Bernie right now. Could those crossover votes been the demise of Hillary in Michigan?DETROIT   Hillary Clinton swept to a widely-expected early victory in Mississippi on Tuesday, but all eyes were on Michigan as polls started to close there at 8 p.m. and Bernie Sanders jumped to a small early lead.The Vermont senator   whose campaign has long seen Michigan as a strategically important state   held a tight margin over the former secretary of state, but very few results were in from Wayne County, the home of Detroit, where Clinton is likely to perform well. Clinton s victory in Mississippi, a heavily African-American southern state, was called as soon as polls closed, following the pattern set by her easy wins across the south starting with South Carolina in February. Bernie Sanders barely competed in Mississippi, choosing to focus on the other state voting on Tuesday.Neither Clinton nor Sanders were in Michigan Tuesday night, but their absence doesn t imply indifference. Both candidates have campaigned hard in the state   Sanders for the chance to gain ground on the former secretary of state, and Clinton to close the door on his candidacy with a win in a competitive, delegate-rich state.Initial exit polling in Michigan showed just over three-fifths of Democratic voters believed both candidates  policies are about right on the ideological scale, according to ABC News. About 60 percent of voters said Clinton was honest and trustworthy, versus about 80 percent who said the same of Sanders. And around 60 percent said honesty or empathy was the most important attribute for a candidate   slightly more than the four-in-10 who said electability or experience was most important.Read more: Politico",politics,"Mar 8, 2016",3290
“Get Out Of Your Trucks And Run Away”…OBAMA’S MILITARY Gives 45 Minute Warning To ISIS Before Bombing Oil Tankers,"Why would any sane person choose to enlist in our military when we don t even have a Commander In Chief who is fighting this war to win?  Last week, in the wake of Russian and US airstrikes on ISIS oil convoys, we asked three important questions:Who are the commodity trading firms that have been so generously buying millions of smuggled oil barrels procured by the Islamic State at massive discounts to market, and then reselling them to other interested parties? In other words, who are the middlemen?Can it possibly be true, as officials now claim, that the Obama administration refrained from bombing Islamic State oil trucks because Washington thought the group was  only  making $100 million per year instead of $400 million?Is it likely, considering how cavalier the US is about collateral damage from drone strikes, that The Pentagon refused to take out Islamic State s revenue stream because the military was afraid of killing a few  innocent  truck drivers who by definition knew they were transporting illegal crude for a terrorist organization?The first question is, for now anyway, unanswerable. As to the second and third, here s what we said:Perhaps the US overestimated the effect its airstrikes were having on Islamic State s oil production capabilities and perhaps The Pentagon was concerned with killing innocent truck drivers, but it could also be that, as Sergei Lavrov suggested earlier this month, the US has until now intentionally avoided hitting ISIS where it hurts in order to keep them in the game and ensure they can still be effective at destabilizing Assad. If you cut off the oil trade, they lose the ability to battle the regime.Whatever the case, it s too late now, because just as Russian airstrikes and the Iranian ground presence forced the US to do something   anything   to prove to the world that America is serious about fighting terrorism, Moscow s targeting of ISIS oil convoys has forced the US to get on board (the Russians are going to hit them anyway, so there s no point in vacillating).American airstrikes reportedly destroyed 116 oil tanker trucks earlier this month and another 280 today in Paris mastermind Abdelhamid Abaaoud s former fiefdom of Deir ez-Zor.Of course the US would hate to catch ISIS off guard risk killing innocent truck drivers, so prior to the November 16 strike, US planes dropped leaflets warning the drivers to  get out of your trucks now, and run away from them.  Here s the leaflet (note the stick figures running for their lives):Here s some commentary from Colonel Steve Warren from Operation Inherent Resolve (delivered at a press conference earlier this month):Early Sunday morning in Al-Bukamal, which is the southern blue circle number two, you see two blue circles there. They both represent Tidal Wave II operations, but we re in the southern one   the one further towards the bottom of your screen, there.In Al-Bukamal, we destroyed 116 tanker trucks, which we believe will reduce ISIL s ability to transport its stolen oil products.This is our first strike against tanker trucks, and to minimize risks to civilians, we conducted a leaflet drop prior to the strike. We did a show of force, by   we had aircraft essentially buzz the trucks at low altitude.So, I do have copy of the leaflet, and I have got some videos, so why don t you pull the leaflet up. Let me take a look at it so I can talk about it.As you can see, it s a fairly simple leaflet, it says,  Get out of your trucks now, and run away from them.  A very simple message.And then, also,  Warning: airstrikes are coming. Oil trucks will be destroyed. Get away from your oil trucks immediately. Do not risk your life. And so, these are the leaflets that we dropped   about 45 minutes before the airstrikes actually began.And here s an amusing bit from the post-presser Q&A:Q: On Bob s question, too, if   if it s so important to cut off the oil shipments, the critical revenue source for ISIS, why did it take so long to take out 116 oil tanker trucks?COL. WARREN: No, that s a great question, Jim. Thanks for asking it.So, a little history on Operation Tidal Wave II. Initially, we, you know, we have been striking oil infrastructure targets since the very beginning of this operation.What we found out was that many of our strikes were only minimally effective. We would strike pieces of the oil infrastructure that were easily repaired.When we came to that realization, we conducted some more study   I think I talked about this last week, a little bit   we conducted some more study, and determined how to better strike the oil infrastructure itself, different pieces of the system.During the course of that study, we also determined that part of the illicit oil system, from the oil coming out of the ground at a   at a pump head, to the end of that chain, which is the distribution network.So, this is a decision that we had to make. We have not struck these trucks before. We assessed that these trucks, while although they are being used for operations that support ISIL, the truck drivers, themselves, probably not members of ISIL; they re probably just civilians. So we had to figure out a way around that. We re not in this business to kill civilians, we re in this business to stop ISIL   to defeat ISIL.So basically, it took the US 13 months to figure out that the best way to cripple Islamic State s oil trade was to bomb   the oil.To the extent that occurred to anyone previously, the idea was dismissed because the truck drivers are  probably not members of ISIL.  Well then who are they? Sure, they may not be suiting up in all black and firing RPGs at Toyota Corollas packed with  spies  for a propaganda video, but it s not like they don t know who they re working for.Also, as mentioned above, the US hasn t exactly been shy about engaging targets even when there are women, children, and bedridden hospital patients in the vicinity so it s hard to imagine that anyone at the Pentagon was worried about Islamic State s truck drivers.Whatever the case, the US is apprently set to give ISIS a 45 minute heads up when The Pentagon plans to bomb an oil convoy which we suppose makes sense.It s the least the CIA can do for an old friend.

 Trump Brags About Hurricane Size As Florida Braces For Disaster,"Donald Trump is apparently thrilled that Hurricane Irma will be the biggest storm to ever hit the United States.Only weeks after Hurricane Harvey left a swath of devastation and death in Texas, Florida is bracing for an even deadlier and more destructive storm.People will die. Businesses and homes will be wiped off the map. Suffering and homelessness will be the reality in Florida. But Trump is too busy bragging about the size of the hurricane to actually care about the people who are in the path of the storm.In yet another Twitter rant on Wednesday morning, Trump proclaimed that his team is already in Florida preparing for the storm after bragging about what a  good job  they have done in Texas.Watching Hurricane closely. My team, which has done, and is doing, such a good job in Texas, is already in Florida. No rest for the weary!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 6, 2017In fact, Trump s response to Hurricane Harvey was to brag about the size of that storm, and he ended an Obama-era flood policy as Houston drowned. Trump has also proposed massive cuts to FEMA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which predicts and tracks hurricanes.It should also be noted that Trump inherited a FEMA that took the lessons of Hurricane Katrina seriously in preparation for future storms. So, Trump and his team did nothing special.But what Trump did next on Twitter shows just how little empathy and compassion he has for the people in the path of Hurricane Irma.Hurricane looks like largest ever recorded in the Atlantic!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 6, 2017Yeah, you read that right. Trump literally bragged about the size of this hurricane as if it s something to be proud of. This coming from a man who denies the very climate change that is causing bigger and more destructive hurricanes to form.As Floridians prepare for disaster, they must be wondering why Trump is so excited about watching them get slammed by the largest hurricane to ever strike the United States. If anything, Trump should be concerned about the coming destruction and death instead of bragging like he s about to win a prize.Featured Image: Jim Lo Scalzo   Pool/Getty Images",News,"September 6, 2017",2204
 Golf Addicted 70-Year-Old Man Says He ‘Couldn’t Care Less About Golf’,"Just as drug addicts and alcoholics tend to be in denial of their disease, former reality show star Donald Trump does not think he has a problem. The alleged president has not addressed opioid addiction which is sweeping across the U.S., and that s probably because he, too, suffers from a type of addiction and remains in denial. Donald Trump needs treatment, but that would mean he d have to take a leave of absence from his job.The amateur president has spent 31 days of his time in office visiting at least one of his properties, including 19 visits to his golf clubs. He s been on the job for only 100 days. In contrast, former President Barack Obama only hit the golf course once during the same amount of time in office. Obama s first golf game was on April 26th, 2009.Still yet, as addicts do, Trump defended his frequent weekend trips to his luxury resort and properties, saying he does not care about golfing as much as people might think he does, according to The Hill. I have a lot of property. So if I go to my clubs like in New Jersey, they ll say,  Oh he is going to play golf.  I am not going to play golf,  Trump said in an interview on Fox News.  I couldn t care less about golf. Well, he sure did care when Obama played golf, though. In fact, there are dozens of rage-tweets from Trump about Obama playing golf.Can you believe that,with all of the problems and difficulties facing the U.S., President Obama spent the day playing golf.Worse than Carter  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2014 But I have a place there that costs almost nothing because its hundreds of acres and security and they don t have to close up streets,  Trump added.What Trump means is that it costs him  nothing.  We, the taxpayers, though, are paying big time. It costs us about $3 million a pop every time he visits his Mar-a-Lago resort. Meanwhile, every visit to a Trump-owned property promotes it and that means there s a conflict of interest as he profits from the presidency.Trump did say that he feels  a little guilty  going back to his Trump Tower residence in New York because of all the expenses that are associated with each trip. But, he didn t mention the costs to taxpayers having to foot the bill for having several White Houses, instead of one. For example, the security for Melania Trump in New York reportedly costs the city s Police Department between $127,000 and $146,000 a day to protect her and her son. The Secret Service had to request an additional $60 million in funding to protect Trump and his family. I love New York, but going back is very expensive for the country because they close up Fifth Avenue and they close up 56th Street   and I always feel a little bit guilty when I go there,  he said.Trump said he does not want to be perceived as  lazy  but noted that he prefers to visit his other properties because they are not as expensive to secure. They are expensive to secure. Trump s frequent visits to his Florida resort have been a financial burden on the county. It would be much better if people would understand that I could go other places that I have,  Trump said.  But then they hit me for relaxing. And I don t want to be known as a person that relaxes because I am working hard and I am working hard for the people. Addiction, whether it be from drugs, alcohol, sex or golfing, is not a prejudiced disease. It can affect you whether you are black, white, Orange, rich or poor, pay your taxes, or if you try to hide your taxes from the public because you pay nothing at all.Photo by Ian MacNicol/Getty Images.",News,"April 29, 2017",3564
“NUMEROUS” CONFLICTING STATEMENTS: Deputy FBI Director in Hot Water After Testimony [Video]," While we re really not surprised by the  conflicting  statements by Andrew McCabe, we just can t believe another type of conflict wasn t an issue long ago. He took hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from the Clintons for his wife s campaign. It doesn t take a rocket scientist to understand that this is a conflict of interest and wrong on every level. Please see our previous report below on McCabe s involvement in his wife s run for Virginia state senate in 2015.FOX News reports:Congressional investigators tell Fox News that Tuesday s seven-hour interrogation of Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe contained numerous conflicts with the testimony of previous witnesses, prompting the Republican majority staff of the House Intelligence Committee to decide to issue fresh subpoenas next week on Justice Department and FBI personnel.Investigators say McCabe recounted to the panel how hard the FBI had worked to verify the contents of the anti-Trump  dossier  and stood by its credibility. But when pressed to identify what in the salacious document the bureau had actually corroborated, the sources said, McCabe cited only the fact that Trump campaign adviser Carter Page had traveled to Moscow. Beyond that, investigators said, McCabe could not even say that the bureau had verified the dossier s allegations about the specific meetings Page supposedly held in Moscow.The sources said that when asked when he learned that the dossier had been funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, McCabe claimed he could not recall   despite the reported existence of documents with McCabe s own signature on them establishing his knowledge of the dossier s financing and provenance.FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe testifies behind closed doors on Capitol Hill. pic.twitter.com/GHjihJkmz4  FOX Business (@FoxBusiness) December 19, 2017OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON MCCABE:Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe is being investigated by the Office of U.S. Counsel violating the Hatch Act according to a new report by Circa News.The Hatch Act prohibits FBI agents from campaigning in partisan races.

I am voting for Jill because she is the best wife ever,  McCabe put on a sign that he photographed himself holding. The photo was posted on her social media page a few days before the election, in response to Dr. Jill McCabe s plea to  help me win  by posting photos expressing reasons why voters should vote for her, according to the complaint.Other social media photos in the complaint showed McCabe s minor daughter campaigning with her mother, wearing an FBI shirt, and McCabe voting with his wife at a polling station.Here is another social media photo of our acting #FBI director, #AndrewMcCabe breaking the rules by campaigning on social media. #Corrupt pic.twitter.com/hBCH29yErY  Senator Dick Black (@SenRichardBlack) May 9, 2017The Hatch Act prohibits FBI employees from engaging  in political activity in concert with a political party, a candidate for partisan political office, or a partisan political group.

BREAKING: REVEALED! Hillary’s Paid Speeches Published By Wikileaks And It’s NOT Pretty,"Excerpts from Hillary Clinton s closed-door paid speeches, including to financial firms, appeared to be made public for the first time on Friday when WikiLeaks published thousands of hacked emails from her campaign chairman.The speech transcripts, a major subject of contention during the Democratic primary, include quotes from Clinton about her distance from middle-class life ( I m kind of far removed ); her vision of strategic governing ( you need both a public and a private position ); and her views on trade, health care, and Wall Street ( even if it may not be 100 percent true, if the perception is that somehow the game is rigged. ) John Podesta, the Clinton campaign chairman, was the latest victim in a wave of hacks on key figures in Democratic politics and the political establishment in what administration officials say is an effort by Russia to undermine the election. Clinton research director Tony Carrk sent the excerpts in an email to Podesta and other senior aides, sourcing the  the flags from HRC s paid speeches  to the Harry Walker Agency, the firm that represented Clinton and arranged her dozens of public and private paid speech deals after she left the State Department in early 2013.The email is dated Jan. 25, 2016, with the subject line,  HRC Paid Speeches.  Carrk identified and sent the  highlights  in the email, telling Podesta and Clinton s communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, that there were  a lot of policy positions that we should give an extra scrub  with the campaign s policy department.*CLINTON IS AWARE OF SECURITY CONCERNS AROUND BLACKBERRIES**Clinton:  At The State Department We Were Attacked Every Hour, More Than Once An Hour By Incoming Efforts To Penetrate Everything We Had. And That Was True Across The U.S. Government. **CLINTON IS MORE FAVORABLE TO CANADIAN HEALTH CARE AND SINGLE PAYER**Clinton Said Single-Payer Health Care Systems  Can Get Costs Down,  And  Is As Good Or Better On Primary Care,  But  They Do Impose Things Like Waiting Times.  *  If you look at countries that are comparable, like Switzerland or Germany, for example, they have mixed systems. They don t have just a single-payer system, but they have very clear controls over budgeting and accountability. If you look at the single-payer systems, like Scandinavia, Canada, and elsewhere, they can get costs down because, you know, although their care, according to statistics, overall is as good or better on primary care, in particular, they do impose things like waiting times, you know. It takes longer to get like a hip replacement than it might take here.  [Hillary Clinton remarks to ECGR Grand Rapids, 6/17/13]Two campaign spokespeople did not respond to a request for comment early on Friday evening seeking confirmation on the authenticity of the excerpts.During this year s long-fought Democratic primary, Sen. Bernie Sanders repeatedly pressed Clinton to release the transcripts of the speeches, which were delivered to a variety of groups, including major firms like Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank. Late last year, Clinton said she would  look into  releasing the transcripts. She never did, arguing that Republicans and others should also release theirs.  Let everybody who s ever given a speech to any private group under any circumstances release them,  she told ABC this February.  We ll all release them at the same time.  Late into the primary, Sanders argued that the American people had a right to know what Clinton told well-heeled audiences on Wall Street about her economic policy.  We all rely on the market s transparency and integrity. So even if it may not be 100 percent true, if the perception is that somehow the game is rigged, that should be a problem for all of us, and we have to be willing to make that absolutely clear,  Clinton said in one apparent excerpt, softening an assertion she has made frequently on the trail, that  the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.  In the same remarks, attributed to a 2014 speech to Deutsche Bank, Clinton also said that much of financial reform  really has to come from the industry itself.  The flagged excerpts don t provide context for Clinton s remarks, but include several comments in which she appears to express strong pro-trade sentiments.  My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders,  Clinton is quoted as telling a Brazilian bank in 2013.  We have to resist, protectionism, other kinds of barriers to market access and to trade. The apparent speech transcripts have spilled out into the public as young voters and progressives, including those who flocked to Sanders  campaign, still have questions about Clinton and may turn to a third-party candidate in the fall.Read more: Buzzfeed",politics,"Oct 7, 2016",4749

 CNN Host Tells Senate Republican To Do His Damn Job (VIDEO),"Republican Senator Orrin Hatch tried to justify not doing his job and Chris Cuomo was having none of it.During an appearance on CNN on Tuesday, Senate Judiciary Committee member Orrin Hatch attempted to defend the decision of Senate Republicans to refuse to hold confirmation hearings for anyone President Obama nominates to fill the vacant seat of Justice Antonin Scalia, who passed away on Saturday.Ever since news broke of Scalia s death, Republicans have made it clear that they won t allow President Obama to fill the empty position on the bench, opting instead to wait a year until whomever is elected president in November takes office, which they hope will be a Republican.But host Chris Cuomo told Hatch that he and his GOP colleagues should do their damn jobs as the Constitution requires, especially since the document conservatives claim they love so much says nothing about a president not being able to pick a judicial nominee during an election year. You don t get to not vote on judges just because it is an election year and final year of someone s presidency. So, that hypocrisy is as play as well,  Cuomo bluntly said.  You don t have to like whom he nominates, but shouldn t you go through the process? Of course, like a good little obstructionist Hatch continued to insist that Republicans don t have to do anything.  No, I don t think there is any real reason to do that,  he said. To which Cuomo asked,  What about the Constitution? Hatch responded by claiming that President Obama has been treated fairly by Senate Republicans, which we all know is a crock of shit considering the record amount of obstructing the GOP has done since President Obama first took office seven years ago. At the end of his response, Hatch revealed the only real reason why Republicans want to wait to replace Scalia. Look, this president s been treated fairly. 40 percent of the federal judiciary up and Republicans have allowed votes on all of those. Now what they are saying is look, we are in a tremendous presidential campaign, there is a lot of bitterness on both sides, let s diffuse this thing and let s put this until the next president of the United States. We ll wait and use discretion, and whoever is the next president will do the job. Now the Democrats of course naturally want this because they want to have a 5-4 majority on the court. Throughout the interview, Hatch claimed that Democrats muddied up the system by not confirming conservative extremist Robert Bork to the high court. However, Cuomo pointed out that Democrats at least held confirmation hearings as required by the Constitution and went through the process. It s just that at the end Bork wasn t confirmed, which is the Senate s right. The Senate does have the power to reject a nominee. So it appears Hatch and his fellow Republicans all have a case of sour grapes because Democrats did their job. As it turned out, Anthony Kennedy ended up being confirmed to the Supreme Court instead of Bork.The bottom line is that Senate Democrats went through the process even though they eventually rejected Bork. Fun fact: six Republicans voted against Bork as well.Cuomo then informed Hatch that a 4-4 court is not a good thing because many cases won t be settled due to constant ties, which would delay a real decision while cases pile up since unresolved cases have to be refiled and argued again. But Hatch thinks a 4-4 court is a good thing. A 4-4 court functions it s functioned in the past. It will function this time. Just on the really controversial issues they will probably put them off for a year. It is not the end of the world. As a matter of fact, it is a smart thing to do. And as he had done multiple times throughout the interview, Hatch brought up the presidential election and how it would somehow be unfair to hold hearings during this time. And when Cuomo mentioned that the Constitution doesn t say anything about not confirming judges during a election year, Hatch claimed the Constitution  gives you every right to defer this. And to make sure that it is done in the best of ways so that both sides have an opportunity to have their person in the presidency and then, you know, if the Democrats win we ll go through this process the way it ought to be gone through. Here s the video via YouTube.Again, Hatch makes a bullshit claim because we all know that if Republicans still control the Senate in 2017, they will continue to throw a temper tantrum and refuse to do their job if Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders is the president who makes a nomination. In other words, things will be no different than they are right now.Hatch and Senate Republicans are the reasons why our government can t get anything done for this country and now they are threatening to derail the judicial system and break all precedent just because they don t want the Supreme Court to shift away from the extreme conservative ideology that has controlled the Court for decades. This is totally outrageous and the American people need to punish Republicans for this failure to do their jobs. After all, if any normal American worker failed to do their job, they d be fired. So should Senate Republicans. Featured image from Raw Story",News,"February 16, 2016",5210
CBS HIT JOB On New Tax Bill Backfires When Accountant Meets With Middle Class Taxpayers…Winning! [Video],"For weeks and weeks we ve heard the propaganda and DNC talking points about how President Trump was going to trick Americans with the tax cuts. Well, CBS News just lost one of their false narratives today.Despite their earnest efforts, they were forced to broadcast financial results from three families they used as representative examples of the Trump tax plan.The weeks-long media spin ran into the wall of reality: We asked an accountant to crunch the numbers for three working families to see how much they could be saving. Tony Dokoupil reports. It s safe to say that all three families were surprised at their savings. They were like so many other Americans who bought into the gloom and doom narrative with tax reform.HERE S ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF HOW BRAINWASHED PEOPLE ARE AGAINST TRUMP S TAX PLAN:Liberal college students don t care much for Donald Trump s new tax plan unless of course they re told that Bernie Sanders came up with it They can t help it They ve been taught Trump=bad Bernie=good so they know nothing else Maybe this will teach them to think for themselves Ya think?President Donald Trump s proposal for comprehensive tax reform was almost immediately dismissed as heartless and impractical by his political opponents.But what would some of those opponents think if they were told the same plan was being proposed by someone they adore Senator Bernie Sanders?To find out, we headed to George Washington University to ask students their opinions on Trump s new tax plan. WIthout much explanation, the students immediately made clear their distaste for the plan.

Agent Angelina: Are CIA Using Hollywood’s Jolie as Soft Power Operative?,"21st Century Wire says In previous articles, 21WIRE has consistently raised the question of whether or not the CIA and the Pentagon have been using Hollywood celebrities as soft power pawns in order to help grease foreign policy objects over seas. This charge has always been met by narrow mainstream minds as a  conspiracy theory    even though we have provided evidence which indicates this is a very real practice, and one with historic precedents. Seems that the mainstream claim that  the CIA wouldn t hire someone like that  won t fly anymore.  We have talked about Dennis Rodman, and George Clooney as two high-profile  ambassadors  of the US, inserted into trouble areas in order to achieve various PR, strategic or intelligence ends.This latest admission regarding actress Angelina Jolie is even more telling   where it is claimed she was being used as an expensive honey pot to lure the illusive (and possibly non-existent) Joseph Kony of the Lord s Resistance Army in the jungles of Uganda.Andrew Korybko Oriental ReviewIt s long been suspected that the actress willingly promotes CIA psy-op narratives in her films, but this time new leaks allege that Angelina Jolie had also at one time considered being the Pentagon s  bait  to  catch Kony , which draws into question the true motivation of other celebrities  foreign policy forays such as Dennis Rodman s  friendship  with Kim Jong-Un. Agent AngelinaAngelina Jolie is the poster woman for the  Hollywood-Intelligence Complex , the perfect example of a willing CIA asset who regularly goes along with  deep state  narratives in her films, such as the anti-Serb production  In The Land Of Blood And Honey . She s also been one of the loudest global cheerleaders for  humanitarian interventions  abroad, or in other words, imperialist wars waged under distorted or outright fabricated  humanitarian  reasons such as the one that she had been lobbying for in Darfur. Jolie often visits US troops abroad like in Afghanistan, though up until now there were no grounds for suggesting that she was anything other than a propagandist, as it would have been ordinarily absurd to even countenance her playing an active role in the battlefield.That s no longer the case anymore, though, according to a report by The Sunday Times, a UK-based media outlet, which claims to have read leaked International Criminal Court (ICC) documents alleging that the starlet told the organization s former chief prosecutor that she d be willing to volunteer herself as a bait to catch the phantasmal African warlord Joseph Kony. The Sunday Times article is mostly hidden behind a paywall, however, so the average information consumer needs to rely on second-hand sources such as People magazine in order to learn about what s in those leaks free of charge. According to the celebrity news site: A hoard of 40,000 ICC documents leaked to the French investigative website Mediapart reveals that Jolie once offered to act as human bait in a trap to arrest brutal Ugandan warlord Joseph Kony.She  has the idea to invite Kony to dinner and then arrest him,  reads an e-mail sent by former ICC Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo, reports The Sunday Times. Forget other celebrities, she is the one,  Moreno Ocampo adds in another email.  She loves to arrest Kony. She is ready. Probably Brad [Pitt] will go also. According to The Sunday Times, which has seen the Mediapart documents, Moreno Ocampo hoped that Jolie and her now estranged husband would travel to the Central African Republic with a team of US Special Forces.It was thought that their presence would then draw Kony out of his armored compound and enable the US forces to take him into custody. If these allegations are true, then it would mean that Jolie had graduated from the usual propagandist class of Hollywood operatives to an in-field asset of the Pentagon in conspiring to carry out a globally important mission. Truth be told,  catching Kony , as the viral 2012 slogan went, isn t really that significant of a deal because the warlord is thought to have barely any supporters nowadays after years on the run in the transnational jungled space between his native Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan, and the Central African Republic. In fact, the whole purpose of the CIA psy-op to  catch Kony  was to  justify  US special forces  presence in this strategic region long enough for them to manufacture civil wars in South Sudan and the Central African Republic, which would turn them into a  failed state belt  that forever prevents their crucial incorporation into a Chinese-built bicoastal Silk Road through their resource-rich territories.The geopolitics of the Kony diversion aren t the focus of this article, so it s recommended that readers review some of the author s hyperlinked analyses above if they re interested in learning more about this Hybrid War campaign. Instead, it s important to focus on the relationship between celebrities and the  deep state , both in the propaganda and   as can now be seen   in-field operational manifestations. Thus far, it doesn t seem like any of Jolie s peers attempted to follow in her footsteps by partaking in such a high-profile covert mission, but toning down the drama just a notch and removing the lethal risk involved in her extreme example, it s certainly possible that other  famous people  are doing something similar in serving their governments.ODD COUPLE: Joseph Kony & Angelina JolieThe Rodman-Kim CaseThe most relevant case that comes to mind is Dennis Rodman, who s the US   Kim whisperer  in passing along messages through what he calls  basketball diplomacy  but who actually functions as the best American pair of eyes and ears that has ever gotten to known the reclusive North Korean leader in person. It s been speculated for a few years already that Rodman might indeed be working for the CIA, but this was always dismissed by more mainstream voices who retort that he s either  too stupid  or that  the CIA wouldn t hire someone like that , but these critics never take the time to consider that Rodman might be coerced into doing this in order to avoid a hushed-up drug bust or something of that nature.In any case, his last visit to the communist country was a failure because he wasn t allowed to meet with Kim Jong-Un, although he did claim credit for jailed provocateur Otto Warmbier s release shortly before his death. Given that the American student was going to die anyway from what was likely complications from his unsuccessful suicide attempt in trying to overdose on sleeping medicine, he probably would have been released whether Rodman came to the country or not, but it s very telling that Kim Jong-Un refused to meet with his  best friend  during this time. Incidentally, it was shortly after this that the war of words and  insult diplomacy  between the North Korean and American leaders really took off, which might have been inspired by Trump finding out from his intelligence chiefs that they had lost their precious Rodman-Kim connection because Pyongyang could have figured out what the basketballer was really up to.Although it s only speculation at this point, it would indeed explain why Trump made a show out of appearing to go crazy and resorting to the  madman theory  in dealing with Kim Jong-Un, as the US Intelligence Community might have concluded that this is the only realistic way left for directly communicating with his North Korean counterpart. With Rodman s last reconnaissance mission cut short and ultimately unsuccessful, the US might have feared that Kim was signaling to them that he was prepared to imminently flex his muscles in vengeful showmanship for having been deceived this long, and while it s impossible to know exactly what he was in fact thinking, North Korea did end up staging several highly provocative missile launches this summer after Rodman s visit and even carried out a nuclear test.The above narrative might sound dubious upon first read, but it certainly deserves to be reconsidered in light of the revelation that Angelina Jolie was working with the Pentagon as part of a highly secret special operation to  catch Kony , which would in that case not make it sound so crazy to imagine that Dennis Rodman might have been doing similar field work for the CIA in collecting valuable personal intelligence about Kim Jong-Un.Even if the North Koreans are actually aware of what Rodman is up to nowadays, that doesn t mean that he ll never be allowed back into what some have derisively called the  Hermit Kingdom , as there s a certain value that could be derived from continuing to use him for informal diplomatic purposes and indirect communication with the US  deep state Continue this story at Oriental ReviewREAD MORE HOLLYWOOD NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Hollywood FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV ",US_News,"October 11, 2017",8895

" Russian Photographer In The Oval Office Raises Eyebrows, Security Problems","Former U.S. intelligence officials have criticized the presence of a Russian photographer capturing President Trump s meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in the Oval Office on Wednesday, citing the potential for a security breach. Concerns were raised after photographs of the meeting were posted on the TASS Russian News Agency website.The White House, however, is playing down the situation, with one senior administration official stating that the Russian had to go through the same screening as a member of the U.S. press going through the main gate to the [White House] briefing room.  Furthermore, the official claims that the White House was misled, claiming that Russian officials had stated that the individual in question was actually Lavrov s personal photographer, concealing the fact that he was also a TASS employee, clearing demonstrating their screening of the Russian photographer was not sufficient. We were not informed by the Russians that their official photographer was dual-hatted and would be releasing the photographs on the state news agency,  said the White House administration official.Former deputy CIA director David S. Cohen was one of several who expressed their concerns over the Russian photographer s presence. Cohen took to Twitter to respond to an online question as to whether or not he thought it was an intelligent decision to have the photographer present at the event, tweeting No it was not.  However, Cohen would not elaborate when pressed for further opinions.Other former security officials have made their unease over the whole situation public, with some describing it as a potential security threat, claiming that White House security screenings aren t foolproof and sophisticated espionage devices could be missed. Others have noted that, not only is it not below the Russians to plant a bug in the White House, but if they managed to pull off such a feat, it wouldn t be the first time they were successful. In late 1999, a listening device that was eventually traced back to Russia was found in a White House conference room where Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had been conducting meetings.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"May 11, 2017",2214
 Republican Mailer Threatens To Out Voters To Neighbors If They Vote Democrat,"New Mexico Republicans are resorting to intimidation tactics to scare voters into voting for Donald Trump.The Republican Party is literally sending out flyers to people across the state warning them that if they don t vote GOP on Election Day they will tattle on them to their neighbors and make life more difficult for them.According to the Daily Beast,The mailer shows a woman in a cold blue hue peeking through her blinds.  When the Democrats win the election and you didn t do your part  your neighbors will know,  it reads, in all caps.The back shows a map of houses, some tagged with red check marks in blue pinpoints. Do your part in this election,  it says.  After all, voting is a matter of public record. While whether you voted or not is a matter of public record, who or what party you voted for is not. Obtaining and using such information to threaten voters is election fraud and voter intimidation, both of which are federal crimes.18 U.S, Code 594 states,Whoever intimidates, threatens, coerces, or attempts to intimidate, threaten, or coerce, any other person for the purpose of interfering with the right of such other person to vote or to vote as he may choose  shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.And a spokesman for the New Mexico GOP admitted that the party sent out the flyer, thus admitting to committing a crime. But when further questioned about the flyer, W. Tucker Keene hung up on the The Daily Beast.While Donald Trump and his deplorable supporters continue to cry about election fraud, their own party is committing that very crime in New Mexico. The question is do they have a problem with that or do they only care about non-existent election fraud that Democrats are supposedly going to commit?Because not having a problem with real election fraud just because it is perpetrated by Republicans would make them hypocrites.By outing people who vote Democrat, the New Mexico GOP would be putting Americans in danger of being persecuted or worse just because they voted a certain way.Sending out a mailer with the intent to intimidate voters is illegal and the New Mexico GOP should be under investigation by the Department of Justice. This is an outrageous dirty tactic and there needs to be serious consequences.Featured Image: Daily Beast ",News,"October 16, 2016",2314
SAY “HELLO” TO YOUR NEW NEIGHBORS! Clooney Begged For Open Borders…Now Massive Refugee Camp Is Erected In His Front Yard,"Karma it s a beautiful thing A massive makeshift refugee camp has been established in Lake Como, the popular and secluded celebrity hideaway in Italy where Hollywood A-lister George Clooney keeps a home.The migration of hundreds of people from Arab nations, Africa, and Asia was triggered following the Swiss government s decision to close its southern border with Italy.Now, waiting for smugglers to lead them into northern Europe, groups of migrants are camping out in tattered tents around the Lake Como resort.https://twitter.com/ScatterBrainPOD/status/753134667490930688Flimsy dwellings, clothes and trash are scattered around the Northern Italian town s railway station, where dozens of new families and refugees have flocked.https://twitter.com/PatriceArnold25/status/753183423573794825The migrant camp is, oddly enough, just steps away from the front door of immigration activists  George and Amal Clooney s multi-million dollar lakeside mansion in Lake Como, according to the Daily Mail.The power couple has spent some time talking about the migrant crisis. The Clooneys met privately with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in February and praised and thanked her for her leadership during the crisis.The Clooneys have taken refuge from the Hollywood spotlight in their summer home in Italy for years. Last year, Page Six reported that Clooney was mulling putting his Lake Como villa on the market due to ever-present and intrusive paparazzi.It is unclear if the recent deluge of refugees pouring into town will have an affect on Clooney s decision to sell or not.

 People Are Going To LOSE IT When They Discover What Trump Is Doing With DAPL,"This should come as a surprise to no one ever because alleged president Donald Trump has a seedy financial interest in the Dakota Access Access Pipeline. Energy Transfers Partners, the very company that is the pipeline, donated $100,000 to a Trump Victory Fund before the election in the hopes that he d greenlight it, Mother Jones reported.In fact, according to disclosure forms at the time, Trump had as much as $300,000 personally invested in the project.As it happens, our alleged president will likely overturn a permit denial that prohibited the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL), which was the focus of months of massive protests by Native Americans and others who took part in the demonstrations, the Independent reports. I m not going to get in front of the President s executive actions,  Spicer said,  but I will tell you that areas like the Dakota and Keystone pipeline are areas that we can increase jobs, increase economic growth, and tap into America s energy supply. That s something that he s been very clear about. Without elaborating, Press Secretary Sean Spicer did not provide specifics about the newly minted president s plans regarding continuing construction of the DAPL and the Keystone XL Pipeline. However, Spicer did suggest that the new administration would move forward with the project.Trump s plan to go forward with the Dakota Access Pipeline isn t going down well on social media.Spicer won t  get in front  of Trump on Keystone or #DAPL, but people will sure as hell get in front of Keystone & #DAPL to stop them.  Travis Nichols (@travisjnichols) January 23, 2017The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced this past December that it would not grant the final permit that was needed for the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline to be completed. It additionally stated that it would conduct an environmental impact review before continuing any part of the process.Get this: Trump is not behind the Standing Rock Tribe, and that is most likely because he has a financial interest in the pipeline.

 Dem Senator ‘Increasingly Concerned’ Trump Will Fire Mueller And Rosenstein To Stop Russia Probe,"Donald Trump is desperate to stop the investigation into his dirty Russian escapades and even went as far as firing FBI Director James Comey, who just happened to be investigating him. Now, Sen. Dianne Feinstein says she is growing  increasingly concerned  that Trump might try to fire both Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is overseeing the probe into Trump s possible collusion with Russia and his obstruction of justice, and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.Feinstein, who is the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, laid out her concerns in a statement on Friday. The message the president is sending through his tweets is that he believes the rule of law doesn t apply to him and that anyone who thinks otherwise will be fired. That s undemocratic on its face and a blatant violation of the president s oath of office,  she wrote.Citing Trump s most recent tweets regarding the Russia investigation, which he has repeatedly called a  witch hunt,  Feinstein said Trump has  embarked on an effort to undermine anyone with the ability to bring any misdeeds to light. The Senate should not let that happen. We re a nation of laws that apply equally to everyone, a lesson the president would be wise to learn,  Feinstein said.Trump doesn t have the authority to fire Mueller. However, he can order Rosenstein to fire him. When Rosenstein testified before Congress, he said that he would only consider firing Mueller if there was  good cause.  But if Trump wanted to, he is able to fire Rosenstein and appoint someone who, after Senate confirmation, would follow his orders blindly.But Feinstein warned that this would be a huge mistake on Trump s part and would inevitably lead to a revolt of  even his staunchest supporters. If the president thinks he can fire Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein and replace him with someone who will shut down the investigation, he s in for a rude awakening. Even his staunchest supporters will balk at such a blatant effort to subvert the law,  she said.The similarities between Trump and Nixon just keep piling up. If he were to go the route Feinstein fears, it would be the Saturday Night Massacre all over again and would probably lead to the same outcome: impeachment.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"June 16, 2017",2264
 WATCH: Fox News Host Flies Off The Handle At Republicans For Not Supporting Trump,"Donald Trump is now the presumptive Republican nominee for president and many in the GOP elite have a serious problem with this reality. They don t have a problem with Trump because he s a racist, a chauvinist, or an advocate of violence.  Let s keep in mind that many Republican politicians have shown those tendencies, all be it veiled with civility. Rather, today s  GOP elite have a problem with Trump because he s got a big mouth about what the GOP stands for and because he s not a part of the elite Republican establishment.Well, Fox host Sean Hannity, a whack job in his own right, wasn t having it with the Republican establishment and quickly came to The Donald s rescue by becoming unhinged on his Fox News show. In an interview with Republican National Committee Chair Reince Priebus, Hannity appeared emotional and frustrated because of the lack of support coming for Trump from the heavy weights of the Republican Party, including Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney, George H.W. Bush, and George W. Bush.  To me it seems selfish,  the whiny Hannity told the RNC chair.Priebus gave a measured response, telling Hannity that  it s gonna take some time for some people to come to grips and to get to know Donald Trump and to get on board. This has been going on a year!  Hannity pouted.  What do they need to know? At one point Hannity went on the attack against House Speaker Paul Ryan saying,  I m not ready to support Speaker Ryan anymore. I m thinking maybe we need a new speaker. To his credit, Donald Trump has done one thing that has made many people happy. He has the Republican Party in shambles and that bodes well for democracy come November.Watch video here:Feature image via video screenshot.",News,"May 6, 2016",1704

"THE ROBBING OF INNOCENCE: 12 Yr Old Students Given CDC Survey About Transgender, Gay And Oral Sex","The left believes these are all perfectly acceptable topics to discuss with our young children. Whatever you do, just don t mention God!A public hearing is taking place Wednesday morning in the Massachusetts State House to look into a controversial sex survey given to middle school and high school students.Developed by the Centers for Disease Control and called the  Youth Risk Behavior Survey,  the survey asks students as young as 12 a series of very personal and highly ideological questions.The survey asks students if they are homosexual and if they are transgender. It also asks if they have had oral or anal sex and if they have performed such acts with up to six people.Whether or not they have carried a gun, smoked cigarettes, consumed alcohol and how much also appear on the questionnaire, as well as whether they have taken drugs, such as OxyContin, Percocet, and Vicodin. It asks how often their guardian uses a seat belt, if the youngster has a sexually transmitted disease, and where they sleep.The group MassResistance says the survey is  psychologically distorting  and will lead the child to think he is  abnormal if he is not doing it all.  The group stated that  having children reveal personal issues about themselves and their family can have emotional consequences.  They also complain that  the survey results are used by radical groups from Planned Parenthood to LGBT groups to persuade politicians to give more taxpayer money [to] these groups. Though students fill out the survey anonymously, MassResistance warns that  they are administered by the teacher in the classroom and there is often pressure for all kids to participate. The test is given nationally and not without controversy. The Chicago Tribune reported two years ago that a Chicago teacher was reprimanded for telling students they had a  constitutional right  not to fill out the survey.Via: Breitbart News",left-news,"May 6, 2015",1901
IF HILLARY HAS TO DROP OUT Of The Race…Here’s What Will Happen,"After months of speculation about Hillary s poor health, she appeared to have a pretty serious  episode  after leaving the 9-11 memorial service in NYC. Fortunately, someone was able to capture her on video in a  press-free zone,  as she appeared to be having convulsions and collapsing, forcing the secret service to physically lift her into her vehicle. Many in the media are saying the Democrat Party is scrambling to figure out what to do if Hillary is FORCED to drop out of the race. Of course Hillary wouldn t leave the race on her own for the good of the country or for the good of her party. This is her final shot at the highest office in our nation, and she has already proven there is nothing that will get in her way from her lifelong goal of becoming our first female President. No lie is too big and no scandal will take her down. It s her turn. But in the event that she ends up incapacitated by her illness which, according to many prominent physicians looks more like Parkinson s Disease, here s what would happen if she was forced to drop out:It s never happened before, but if Hillary Clinton has to drop out before Election Day, the Democratic National Committee would pick a successor   and it wouldn t have to be runningmate Tim Kaine.If Donald Trump faced the same situation, the Republican National Committee would select a GOP replacement, perhaps by reconvening 2,472 delegates.Clinton s near collapse over the weekend, coupled with the ages of the two major candidates, have brought the far-flung scenarios into the realm of possibility.There s 55 days until the election as of Tuesday and military and overseas ballots are mailed 45 days before the polls open.Thirty-seven states have some sort of early voting, with North Carolina being the first by mail on Sept. 9.What would really complicate matters is if a nominee had to drop out when ballots have already been cast. It would be an unprecedented, complicated mess,  one election lawyer said.The Electoral College would then select the next president.If the electors couldn t agree, the House of Representatives would make the selection.

"TRUMP KICKS Pro-Amnesty, Globalist Koch Brother And “Author” Friend Off His West Palm Beach Golf Course","President-elect Donald Trump told a critical biographer and guest of billionaire David Koch to leave his West Palm Beach golf course on New Year s Eve, forcing Koch to leave with him.Trump s gesture was another slight against the pro-amnesty, pro- free trade  billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, who opposed Trump during the Republican primary season and refused to help him during the general election. It also signals Trump will not necessarily play nice with the GOP political establishment and Beltway right.The Kochs swooped in during the Tea Party revolt in 2010, training amateur political activists and trying to channel populist energy against the Obama administration into supporting the progressive-business alliance that wanted more cheap labor and lesser sentences for drug traffickers, under the umbrella term of  smaller government. But the  grassroots army  was not controllable,  as one former Koch staffer lamented, and the Kochs appeared curiously unwilling to make any concessions to Americans who wanted populist, nationalist policies, and relief from the relentlessly eroding forces of mass immigration and globalization. A majority of voters  some of whom saw more demographic change take place in their communities than many countries saw in a millennia want immigration slashed in half or reduced to zero. Trump captured that energy and it propelled him to the White House, much to the Kochs  and their network s chagrin.The Kochs wanted candidates amenable to their will, and Trump didn t fit the bill. They considered him a distraction before he rocketed to first in the polls, and even toyed with the idea of spending tens of millions of dollars to attack him.Trump mocked the Kochs while on the campaign trail, calling their preferred candidates  puppets  enacting their donors  agenda:I turned down a meeting with Charles and David Koch. Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics, they will do much better!  Donald J.

 Leave It To Seth Meyers To Absolutely PUMMEL Trump’s Obvious Racism And Fraud (VIDEO),"It s gotten to the point that if you re still considering voting for Donald Trump in November, you ve got to be completely fine with voting for a scam artist and a misogynistic racist. Now, if those are things that you can overlook because of the simplistic view of party line politics, well, that s just sad, but it s your vote.Pointing out Trump s blatant racism, and ever-obvious scam artist antics is Seth Meyers on Late Night during a segment he calls  A Closer Look.  Meyers informed his audience of what Trump University is   fraud.He said: Trump University was founded in 2005, promising to teach people how to make money off real estate. But, as the Washington Post reported, it wasn t a university or even a school; it was just  a series of seminars held in hotel ballrooms across the country.' Meyers then compared getting a degree in business at Trump University is about as valid as getting a medical degree at the Holiday Inn Express. He also pointed out that Trump University is so bad, and so fraudulent, that it scammed mothers trying to feed their kids and even Bernie Madoff would say,  Wow, dog, that s not cool. Not only did Meyers go elbow deep into describing how much of a scam artist Trump is, but also how racist he is. He perfectly summarized it with this one statement: Now to be clear, claiming that someone is not able to do their job because of their race is, by definition, racism. Period. And in regards to Trump pointing and calling out his  African-American  and Republicans all of a sudden seeming to realize Trump is racist, Meyers said: Republicans can t pretend to suddenly be shocked and offended, this is who Trump was well before this latest outburst, and this is who [the GOP is] lining up to support  So remember this when Trump inevitably tries to convince you he s not a racist.

PC TYRANNY: University of Oregon Rules That Professors Have NO Free Speech,"21st Century Wire says By cow-towing to students  over-sensitivity to free speech and seemingly a prenatal requirement for  safe spaces  on campus   academics and university administrators are unknowingly (or knowingly) constructing communitarian unintellectual institutions of tyranny on campuses across America. The end result of this progress  should be obvious to anyone who has studied 20th century history   it is anarchy. If students are allowed to get professors suspended or fired over spurious allegations of  offense caused,  or rather, causing students to feel  uncomfortable    then the entire concept of the university as we once knew it   is finished. By dismissing talent in favor of adherence to an ever new and constantly updated  orthdoxy,  the only professors left to teach in this burgeoning environment of weaponized political correctness will most certainly be under-qualified, mediocre, young, and possibly radical or overly militant instructors.That will be the end of higher education   and as we can now see, it s heading in that direction  (Image Source: Niskan Center)Mark Tapson Truth RevoltWriting for the Washington Post, Eugene Volokh of The Volokh Conspiracy addresses a disturbing development at the University of Oregon, whose administration made clear to its faculty last week that if you say things about race, sexual orientation, sex, religion and so on that enough people find offensive, you could get suspended and possibly even fired. This can happen even to tenured faculty members or to anyone else.  Orthodoxy,  Volokh writes,  enforced on threat of institutional punishment, is what the University of Oregon is now about. This all began with a Halloween party hosted by tenured University of Oregon law school professor Nancy Shurtz attended by about a dozen students and about a dozen nonstudents:Shurtz had told the students that she would be  going as a popular book title ; she didn t tell the students up front what it was, but the book was the recent (and acclaimed)  Black Man in a White Coat,  a black doctor s  reflections on race and medicine  (according to the subtitle). Shurtz s  costume incorporated a white doctor s lab coat, a stethoscope, black makeup on her face and hands, and a black curly wig resembling an afro.  The university report states that Shurtz  was inspired by this book and by the author, that she greatly admires [the author] and wanted to honor him, and that she dressed as the book because she finds it reprehensible that there is a shortage of racial diversity, and particularly of black men, in higher education. [ ] And this perceived offensiveness yielded a huge uproar at the law school. According to the report, the uproar was partly students  immediate reaction and partly a result of the administration s and other faculty members  discussing the matter extensively at school, including in classes.[ ] So we have speech, at a professor s home, but at a party to which she had invited her students, which in turn leads to speech by various people at the law school. (There s no doubt that wearing an expressive costume is treated as equivalent to speech under First Amendment  symbolic expression  purposes.) Some of both kinds of speech are interpreted as expressing offensive messages related to race. What does the university do about this?The university suspended Shurtz.It then released a report concluding that Shurtz s speech constituted  harassment,  which violates university policy. The harassment policy, the university report notes, bans conduct that creates a  hostile environment  based on  age, race, color, ancestry, national or ethnic origin, religion, service in the uniformed services (as defined in state and federal law), veteran status, sex, sexual orientation, marital or family status, pregnancy, pregnancy-related conditions, physical or mental disability, gender, perceived gender, gender identity, genetic information or the use of leave protected by state or federal law. Under the logic of the Oregon report, Volokh notes,  a faculty member could be disciplined for displaying the Mohammed cartoons, if it caused enough of a furor. Or a faculty member could be disciplined for suggesting that homosexuality may be immoral or dangerous. Or for stating that biological males who view themselves as female should be viewed as men, not as women. Or for suggesting that there are, on average, biological differences in temperament or talents between men and women.

"WHITE WASHED? Trump Claims Classified JFK Files Will Be Released, Reigniting Conspiracy Suspicions","Shawn Helton  21st Century Wire JFK FILES    Conspiracy still shrouds the JFK assassination. (Photo Illustration Shawn Helton)The assassination of US President John F. Kennedy, is one of the most infamous crimes of the 20th century. Like the enigmatic attacks of 9/11, it was an act that will forever be shrouded in conspiracy, intrigue and mystery   despite the lone gunman theory implicating Lee Harvey Oswald.New reports indicate that classified documents pertaining to the assassination of the 35th US President will be allowed to be released by US President Donald Trump.The NY Times reports: The release of the information being held in secret at the National Archives   including several thousand never-before-seen documents   was mandated to occur by Oct. 26 under a 1992 law that sought to quell conspiracy theories about the assassination.Mr. Trump has the power to block the release of the documents, and intelligence agencies have pressured him to do so for at least some of them. The agencies are concerned that information contained in some of the documents could damage national security interests.In a statement to reporters, the White House left open the possibility that Mr. Trump might halt the release of some documents. While word of a possible release of never-before-seen JFK files has spread like wildfire throughout mainstream media and alternative media alike, one should remain skeptical and cautious, as the likelihood of the military industrial complex, the CIA and other clandestine agencies releasing any conclusive inter-agency conspiracy related details about the JFK assassination   is next to zero.The globalist Deep State machine that has ruled the US and the world since WWII would have too much to lose if anything larger came out of America s most infamous conspiracy. It would be like opening Pandora s box. (Image Source: circololettori.it)Here s one theory in the mystery surrounding JFK s assassination that includes some uncanny historical and Hollywood associations that we are not likely to hear about In 1980, after a six-hour  suicidal  standoff with police, a contract killer linked to organized crime named Charles Harrelson, admitted to killing US District Judge John H Wood, and in the process, while apparently  high on cocaine  also claimed to have been involved in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.The father of Hollywood star Woody Harrelson was convicted in the murder of a grain dealer named Sam Degelia Jr in 1968 and in 1981, Charles received two life sentences for the murder of John Wood.Throughout 1981, more questions materialized regarding the assassination of Judge Wood in a UPI article: Defense lawyers maintained [Charles] Harrelson was framed by police and the informant. Charles an ex-felon, said a friend, Hampton Robinson III, who failed to show up to testify, had driven the car. He suggested someone, possibly federal agents, had planted the guns so he could be arrested. He denied telling [Department of Public Safety agent] Pagel he carried a gun.   THREE TRAMPS    Charles Harrelson (ID d by forensic experts on the left) is believed to be one of three arrested in Dealey Plaza after JFK s assassination in 1963. (Image Source: jfkmurdersolved)When considering the Harrelson-Kennedy connection, the 1989 book Crossfire comes to mind.Crossfire, written by the recently deceased well-known researcher Jim Marrs, was also adapted for the highly controversial and successful Oliver Stone film JFK. Below is a passage from Crossfire, as it relates to the apparent Harrelson-Kennedy link: Aside from being twice convicted of murder for hire, Harrelson   the father of actor Woody Harrelson   had a long history of involvement with Dallas underworld characters linked directly to Jack Ruby. Continuing, the Crossfire also stated: The late Fort Worth graphics expert Jack White, who testified before the House Select Committee on Assassinations, already had noticed the resemblance of Harrelson to the youngest tramp. In a 1981 interview with Chuck Cook, Harrelson claimed to have the  biggest story  the reporter would ever have, when questioned about Kennedy s death. Additionally, Jo Ann Harrelson noted the  similarities  between the tramp photos and her husband. All this coupled with the fact Diane Lou Oswald (the mother of Woody Harrelson), who had also been married to Charles Harrelson in Midland, Texas, made for a strange background concerning the JFK saga.In a KDFW-TV interview in 1982 below, Charles Harrelson back tracks somewhat on his claims of killing Kennedy   but does point directly to a larger conspiracy concerning the US government s involvement in the death of Kennedy as well as their alleged link to drug trade in America.The interview is a startling revelation, adding to the enigmatic JFK mystery and in the process   provides another strange backdrop to a captivating case . 21st Century Wire says Today, President Donald Trump announced he plans to release the tens of thousands of classified documents on the assassination of President John F Kennedy held at the National Archives and Records Administration. The president believes that these documents should be made available in the interests of full transparency unless agencies provide a compelling and clear national security or law enforcement justification otherwise,  a White House official told Reuters. Subject to the receipt of further information, I will be allowing, as President, the long blocked and classified JFK FILES to be opened,  Trump tweeted on Saturday.Subject to the receipt of further information, I will be allowing, as President, the long blocked and classified JFK FILES to be opened.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 21, 2017Days before Trump s announcement, The Washington Post claim that their National Security Council source told deep state media oracle that federal government agencies have warned the president not to release some of the documents for fear they could somehow comprise  national security , although this rationale is hard to justify as the event took place nearly 55 years ago   unless of course, some legacy parties still in power today were implicated in the remaining documents.It s difficult to know if Trump is referring to all of the remaining CIA and FBI documents, or just some of them, or whether or not these documents will be redacted (presumably to protect any important names involved in the JFK murder, or possible cover-up). However, Trump appears to have left open the possibility that if government agencies feel the documents should not to released, then he would heed their advice. Trump added that his decision was  subject to the receipt of further information. According to Phil Shenon, a professional researcher and author on the Warren Commission: It s great news that the president is focused on this and that he s trying to demonstrate transparency. But the question remains whether he will open the library in full   every word in every document, as the law requires,  Shenon said.  And my understanding is that he won t without infuriating people at the CIA and elsewhere who are determined to keep at least some of the information secret, especially in documents created in the 1990s. The scheduled date of the release is meant to be on October 26, 2017.STAY TUNED FOR MORE UPDATESREAD MORE JFK NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire JFK FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE   SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @ 21WIRE.TV",US_News,"October 21, 2017",7446

 Mitt Romney Just Went After Donald Trump For Being EXACTLY Like Mitt Romney (VIDEO),"Back in 2012, getting then-Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney to show his back tax returns was like pulling teeth. He knew that if he showed his returns he would not only be displaying how much he truly makes, but he would be revealing how much he actually pays in taxes. Now, Romney has decided to go after present-day Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump for the very same reason.Romney seems to be legitimately concerned that there may be some sort of  bombshell  hidden within Trump s taxes that will show something the American people won t like at all.While appearing on Fox News with Neil Cavuto, Romney said: I d like to see a number of things from the candidates, not just their positions on issues, in some detail. And some candidates are more thorough in laying out what they re going to do than others. But I d also like to see their back taxes. I d like to see where they filed their taxes in the last several years. I m not talking about their taxes this year. I m talking about the taxes that have already been filed with the IRS. And Donald Trump and Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz have not shown us their back taxes. You know, this was an issue in my campaign.They were all over me for my taxes, it became a big issue. But I put my taxes out in January of 2012. And that gave people a chance to digest it and decide whether I was going to be the nominee or not. If in fact Donald Trump s taxes or Marco Rubio s or Ted Cruz s have some real problems in there, let s get them out there and see them. But I think it s pretty clear that given Donald Trump s dodging and weaving and delay, I think the last time he was asked about his taxes he said,  well, it s going to be a month.  Look, people have a right to know if there s a problem in those taxes before they decide. Romney also said: We have good reason to believe that there s a bombshell in Donald Trump s taxes Either he s not anywhere near as wealthy as he says he is, or he hasn t been paying taxes we would expect him to pay or perhaps he hasn t been giving money to vets or to the disabled like he s been telling us he s been doing. Now, besides just accusing Trump of random things, let s think about this for a second. Is Romney actually concerned about what s in Trump s taxes, or is he just trying to do to Trump what was done to him? Maybe it s some sort of sweet revenge for him. However you look at it, Romney looks like a giant walking and talking hypocrite, and one of the first to point that out was none other than Trump himself.Mitt Romney,who totally blew an election that should have been won and whose tax returns made him look like a fool, is now playing tough guy  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 24, 2016He s not wrong. That does seem to be exactly what he s doing.Either way, Trump should make his finances transparent to the American voting public so they can judge for themselves if they approve of the way Trump handles his finances, but Romney, especially on this issue, should probably keep his mouth shut. He s the LAST person who should be going after anybody on taxes.Watch here:Featured image via Screen capture Fox News",News,"February 24, 2016",3152
VIOLENT ENVIRONMENTAL LUNATICS Cost Taxpayers MILLIONS To Protect Trump’s EPA Director After Receiving “Unprecedented” Number of Credible Death Threats,"Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt has received an unprecedented amount of death threats, requiring a 24-hour security detail, according to an editorial published in the Wall Street Journal.The paper revealed the EPA has received more than 70  credible threats against EPA staffers, with a disproportionate number menacing Administrator Scott Pruitt and his family,  since President Donald Trump took office.Credible threats from liberal opponents have resulted in the EPA s inspector general s office recommending 24/7 security detail for Pruitt, which is costing taxpayers $2 million per year. Mr. Pruitt has received more than five times as many threats as his predecessor, Gina McCarthy,  the editorial explained.  These include explicit death threats. Some have referenced Mr. Pruitt s home address. Federal law enforcement has determined that some of those threatening Mr. Pruitt are likely capable of carrying out acts of violence. Democratic lawmakers have complained that the security detail is a waste of money, claiming  there is no apparent security threat against the administrator to justify such a security detail or expenditures. EPA security has already caught suspects prowling around the Administrator s neighborhood,  the Journal reported.Liberals have justified the death threats. Last week, a San Francisco columnist argued death threats against Pruitt were justified because he is a  banally evil, milquetoast, science-denying government administrator.  The death threats  make a warped sort of sense,  wrote liberal columnist Mark Morford. Mr. Pruitt didn t invent these threats, and Cabinet members shouldn t have to fear violence as a price of public service,  the WSJ editorial board said.For entire story: WFB",politics,"Nov 2, 2017",1761
 Man Claims He Gave Trump A Golden Shower And He Has Evidence To Back It Up (VIDEO),"You know how conservatives are demanding proof that Donald Trump paid some Russian ladies for a golden shower (honestly, wouldn t we all enjoy that)? Well, this gentleman gave The Donald one for free and he can provide evidence.Meet Dino Rachiele. A quick scroll through his Facebook timeline shows that he doesn t post about politics much, if any (though one post reveals that he makes a delicious-looking Timpano), but he is now gaining recognition for a video he made years ago in which he spoke out about the time that he gave a certain billionaire a golden shower. This video was largely ignored until now but with news breaking that Trump allegedly paid a couple of nice Russian ladies to  drain the swamp  on his bed, his YouTube video is picking up traffic quite quickly.Rachiele manufactures high-end sinks (what did you think we meant by  golden shower,  perverts?) and used to sell home fixtures, according to Gizmodo. In his 2011 video,  I gave Donald Trump a golden shower,  Rachiele   who inexplicably found himself able to vote for someone as terrible as Trump   says he sent Donald Trump one of two gold shower heads in 2007 and decided to gift one of them to The Donald during one of his feuds with Rosie O Donnell because he knows, like a couple Russian prostitutes seem to know, that Donald Trump just adores gold.Now, some might consider it unbelievable that Rachiele gave The Donald a golden shower, so here s a letter from Trump s assistant at the time verifying that Rachiele did, indeed, send Trump a golden showerhead, but it also seems to indicate that it was part of a sales pitch. The letter informed Rachiele that Trump  has no interest in purchasing at this time  with a vague promise of possibly working together in the future and a boilerplate  we wish you the greatest success in your endeavors):In what seems to be a clear attempt to create a demand for a  limited edition  product by first sending one to Trump and later deceptively omitting the fact that it was manufactured by a company owned by Rachiele, he then invites people to email him to get what he claims is the only other one in existence for the hefty price tag of $350. Either he was lying about it being the only one or there were no takers, as he now says he is considering taking bids on it.If conservatives are as stupid as I know they are, Rachiele will be getting his own  golden shower  soon enough when one of them spends their kid s college fund on this piece of poorly manufactured history.Watch his video below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"January 11, 2017",2550
JILL STEIN (HILLARY’S) Recount Collapses: Misses Deadline In Pennsylvania…Sues WI For Refusing Hand Recount [VIDEO],"Jill Stein got less than 1% of the vote nationwide in our presidential election, but after raising more than $7 million to do a recount (at an estimated cost of around $2 million), Jill Stein finds out she missed the deadline to file for a recount in PA. Where will all of the money go that she raised to either throw the election for Crooked Hillary, or to make Trump s presidency appear to be illegitimate? Jill Stein had everything she needed to launch a presidential recount. She had the cash, the grassroots fervor and the spotlight of an adoring media. But there s one thing she needed to overturn Trump s victory: a calendar.  Washington ExaminerThe Wisconsin Elections Commission agreed Monday to begin a recount of the presidential election on Thursday but was sued by Green Party candidate Jill Stein after the agency declined to require county officials to recount the votes by hand.It will be a race to finish the recount in time to meet a daunting federal deadline, and the lawsuit could delay the process. Under state law, the recount must begin this week as long as Stein or another candidate pays the $3.5 million estimated cost of the recount by Tuesday, election officials said.Also Monday, Stein filed a lawsuit in Pennsylvania to force a recount there and her supporters began filing recount requests at the precinct level in the Keystone State. Stein  who received just a tiny piece of the national vote  also plans to ask for a recount in Michigan on Wednesday.Unless Stein wins her lawsuit in Dane County Circuit Court, officials in each of Wisconsin s 72 counties would decide on their own whether to do their recounts of the 2.98 million statewide votes by machine or by hand, with dozens of counties expected to hand count the paper ballots.

At first, supporters said that people skipped because of rain. This swiftly shifted to the excuse that they all have jobs and needed to go to work. Ultimately, Sean Spicer used his first press conference to inform everyone that it was actually the biggest crowd to ever appear, ever, and that  floor mats  were to blame for hiding all the people. Trump, of course, falsely claimed that one million people showed up   a clear sign that he can never measure up to Obama, for whom 1.8 million people came out from under the floor mats when he was first elected, even in The Donald s fantasies.The next four years will be a complete sh*tshow, but at least we have SNL   at least until Trump follows in his puppetmaster s footsteps and starts killing his critics.Watch the opener below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"January 22, 2017",2484
CLUELESS HOLLYWOOD HACKS Attend Refugee-Themed Event,"Wow! A Chinese artist decided it would be a great idea to exploit the refugees by having pillars decorated with the lifejackets used by them. This nut job flew in thousands of life jackets for this obscene display. You have to wonder what this guy was thinking when he had all guests at the charity event don emergency blankets. Yes, that s Charlize Theron taking a selfie with her gold blanket on.  Unreal! The liberal elites don t get how horrible this has been for all of Europe and for those who ve died trying to get to the shores of Greece. A film charity event held alongside an installation in Berlin by the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei has sparked anger.According to Artnet, the Cinema for Peace fundraiser took place at the Berlin Konzerthaus, whose pillars the artist decorated   as part of his installation Safe Passage   with 14,000 lifejackets flown in from Lesbos, Greece, where almost 450,000 refugees arrived in 2015 on their way into the EU:Fundraiser guests, including actor Charlize Theron and Pussy Riot member Nadya Tolokonnikova, were encouraged to don emergency thermal blankets similar to those given to refugees.In a Facebook post, Tim Renner, Berlin s culture secretary, was highly critical of the sight of dinner guests at a star-studded gala posing in the blankets at the party.There are better ways for Ai Weiwei to take a political stand than posing as a drowned infant When Ai Weiwei illustrates the dimensions of terror outside [the gala] with 14,000 life jackets from Lesbos, it is perhaps not subtle but effective and justified; but when the guests of Cinema for Peace are prompted by the organiser to don emergency blankets for a group photo, even if understood as an act of solidarity, it has a clearly obscene element,  he said.Ai Weiwei, whose recent work has focused on the migration crisis, was criticised two weeks ago for recreating a photo of the drowned Syrian toddler Alan Kurdi   for the magazine India Today   in which the artist lies face down on a beach. He maintained that his work was intended to  defend the dignity  of the refugees.Via: The Guardian",politics,"Feb 17, 2016",2099
"HYPOCRISY: PAUL RYAN SENDS HIS KIDS TO Private School That Screens Out Muslims, But Demands We Welcome Hundreds Of Thousands Of Muslims To America","Open borders Ryan might be in for a shock when his GOP competitor, businessman Paul Nehlen gives him a run for his money in what should have been a  safe seat  for him in November.  After the Paris terrorist attack, House Speaker Paul Ryan declared that the United States cannot turn away the hundreds of thousands of Islamist migrants now being approved for visas to enter the United States. Ryan declared that it is not  appropriate  to consider the religious attitudes of would-be migrants seeking admission.After the San Bernardino terrorist attack, Ryan echoed President Obama in condemning what was described as Donald Trump s  religious test.  However, a Breitbart News investigation now reveals that while Paul Ryan wants no  religious test  for who gets admitted into America, Ryan sends his children to a private school that uses a  religious test  in its admissions process.Ryan sends his children to a Catholic school connected to the parish where he was an altar boy as a child.Breitbart News reached out to the school as a perspective applicant and obtained a copy of the school s 2015-2016 registration papers and tuition contract. The document inquires specifically into the applicant s religious background   in particular, it asks whether the applicant is a parishioner at the associated Catholic parish. The school recruits through the parish by offering a tuition discount to those who have been baptized and are members of the parish.The registration form defines what qualifies as a parishioner:A  parishioner  as defined for the purposes of this contract and the attached Addendums is a person who:Is officially registered at  [this] Catholic Parish Has had their children baptized; Fulfills the Sunday Mass obligation and other Holy Days of Obligation; Offers consistent financial support (whether weekly, monthly, quarterly, or annually) through the church offertory envelopes or direct deposit for a minimum of $800 per calendar year; Volunteers service to the parish; and Participates in parish ministries when asked, or if they feel called to share their talent of time. Instead of doing an explicit ban on Muslim students, Ryan s school applies a religious tax on non-parishioner students   thereby creating a two-tiered system for students and their families depending upon whether or not they are parishioners. The registration form explains that  the cost to educate a child at [this] School for the 2015-2016 school year is $4,673.00.  The school charges non-parishioner families a rate that is higher than the cost of educating the child:  For families who do not have at least one parent or guardian who is a parishioner, a minimum of 4,900 tuition per child will be expected. By contrast, parishioners pay less than the cost to educate one child   paying only  a minimum of $1900.00 tuition per child  plus an additional parish contribution of $800   i.e. a total of $2,200 less per year than what is owed by non-parishioners. Parishioners even receive the recruitment incentive of free pre-kindergarten.By signing the contract, parents agree that the tuition they pay  is considered an investment in the Catholic education of my child. As the registration forms explain, the school exists for the express purpose of helping to foster Catholic children:[This] school is a Catholic School established and subsidized by the members of [this] Parish, Janesville, Wisconsin for the purpose of assisting Catholic parents in fulfilling the responsibility to raise their children in the Catholic faith.Therefore, as the school s website explains, the  school primarily serves children of parish families  and non-parishioner families are welcome  as space allows. While Muslim students could presumably get into Ryan s school, the school s reliance on the parish as a recruiting center and the above-cost tuition fees would, by definition, function as a mechanism for screening them out. When Breitbart News spoke to a school representative about the school s religious diversity, the representative said that no student currently enrolled wears a headscarf, even as Paul Ryan s migration policies increasingly introduce this new element into other families  schools.Moreover, in addition to the school s religious tax in the form of higher tuition for non-parishioner students, the school also requires a certain degree of assimilation from its non-Catholic students: namely, if a non-Catholic student is admitted, she must participate in the school s religious functions, which include regular faith-based courses.If the U.S. had an immigration policy that resembled the admission policy of Speaker Ryan s school   i.e. it recruited migrants from churches and synagogues overseas and offered discounted migration to people who attended churches and synagogues   although a Muslim migrant could theoretically get in, the effect would be to substantially reduce Muslim migration and increase Christian and Jewish migration relative to it   a policy which Ryan finds reprehensible for the country, but ideal for his kids  school.While Ryan chooses to insulate his children in an academic environment that considers religion in its admissions process, he has been adamant that the American people are not entitled to be similarly selective about who comes into their country to live as their neighbors, receive their tax dollars, fill public university slots, demand affirmative action, or potentially radicalize against their own country.Days ago, Speaker Ryan even announced that he could not yet support Donald Trump against Hillary Clinton, after Trump became the presumptive GOP nominee selected by Republican voters. Several candidates   Lindsey Graham, Jeb Bush, John Kasich, and Marco Rubio   all ran on Ryan s platform and lost by immense margins. Similarly, Mitt Romney also ran on the Ryan platform and lost in a landslide, as did Eric Cantor in his own Congressional District.Reports have previously noted that one of Ryan s central disagreements with Trump stems from Trump s pledge to enact a temporary pause on Muslim migration   a policy Speaker Ryan publicly denounced even though, according to exit polling data, seven in ten GOP Wisconsin voters support Trump s plan.Trump s proposal  is not what this party stands for. And more importantly, it s not what this country stands for,  Ryan said in December.In the next eight months, the U.S. will issue more visas to Muslim migrants than the number of GOP voters in Ryan s district.Yet, not only does Ryan oppose the temporary migration pause, he has pushed to expand Muslim migration. Ryan has a two-decade long history to pushing to expand immigration rates and has championed legislation that expanded Muslim migration. Last December, Ryan ushered his omnibus spending bill through Congress, which funded visa issuances for nearly 300,000 Muslim migrants, temporary and permanent, over a 12-month time span.In an interview with Sean Hannity in November, Ryan said that he does not support any kind of  religious test  for determining who is admitted entrance into the country   even if the would-be migrants believe that  women can t drive [and] can t be seen in public without a male relative. I don t think a religious test is appropriate. That s not who we are,  Ryan said.  I don t think it s the appropriate test. However, as Andrew McCarthy has previously explained, the U.S. law does, in fact, require a religious test when it comes to making considerations about visa issuances.Ryan grounded his attack of Trump s plan to pause the admission of Muslim foreign citizens on the first amendment right of U.S. citizens.  Freedom of religion is a fundamental Constitutional principle. It s a founding principle of this country,  Ryan said.However, as Sen. Jeff Sessions has explained   contrary to a previous declaration Ryan has made   the role of a U.S. lawmaker is to represent U.S. citizens, not foreign nationals living in foreign countries. As such, Sen. Sessions explains that our first amendment protections extend to U.S. citizens, and not to foreign would-be migrants all around the globe. In his remarks arguing against an amendment offered by Sen. Patrick Leahy and supported by Senate Democrats that would move towards creating a global right to migrate, Sessions said:There are 7 billion people in the world. Choosing who can immigrate into the United States is, by definition, an exclusionary process. The goal is to select immigrants for admission based on the benefits they provide to society  In the United States, we have protections against discrimination by religion, age, disability, country of origin, etc. We have freedom of association. Rights of due process. Now imagine extending these as part of our immigration system. The logical extension of this concept results in a legal regime in which the United States cannot deny an alien admission to the United States based upon age, health, skill, family criminal history, country of origin, and so forth  If we say it is improper to consider religion, then that means it is improper for a consular official to even ask about a candidate s religious beliefs when trying to screen an applicant for entry. It would mean that even asking questions of a fianc  seeking a visa about his or her views on any religious matter   say on the idea of pluralism vs. religious supremacy   would be improper, because if it is improper to favor or disfavor a religion, it is improper to favor or disfavor any interpretation of a religion  Are we really prepared to disallow, in the consideration of tens of millions of applications for entry to the United States, any questions about religious views and attitudes? A U.S.-born citizen who subscribes to theocratic Islam has a freedom of speech that allows him to give a sermon denouncing the U.S. constitution or demanding it be changed. But  [by extending these protections to foreign nationals] a foreign religious leader living overseas could demand a tourist visa to deliver that same sermon and claim religious discrimination if it is not approved.For entire story: Breitbart News",left-news,"May 9, 2016",10093
EPIC SPEECH WELL WORTH WATCHING! Trump’s Remarks To Builders: “The era of economic victory for our country has just begun” [Video],"What s better than a president who s a builder speaking to builders and construction workers. In President Trump s speech he calls out people by name pretty great! He knows business and building. We re in good hands America!TRANSCRIPT: I want to thank Sean McGarvey and the entire governing board of presidents for honoring me with this great invitation. And I love that it s in Washington, because I don t have to travel very far. Worked out pretty well, I have to tell you. Five minutes.Sean took part in one of our very first meetings at the White House  - he mentioned it   and I promise you that America s labor leaders will always find an open door with Donald Trump. Always. (Applause.) Just look at the amazing talent assembled here. We have ironworkers, insulators   (applause)   never changes, does it, with the ironworkers? Let s hear it. Laborers. (Applause.) Painters. (Applause.) Fitters. (Applause.) Plumbers. (Applause.) Operators   they re operators, all right, I ll tell you that. (Laughter.) Electricians. (Applause.) Not that good. Where s my Local 3? Where s Local 3? That wasn t that good, the electricians   well, they became so rich they don t have to   (laughter)   let s do that again. Electricians. (Applause.) That s better.Bricklayers. (Applause.) Boilermakers. (Applause.) Elevator constructors. (Applause.) Good job. Sheet-metal workers. (Applause.) Roofers. (Applause.) Plasterers   plaster, well, yeah, that s   not using as much plaster as we used to, fellas, right? No matter how you cut it. Sorry about that. I m not sure I can do much   we brought back the coalminers. I m not so sure about the plasterers. We ll do the best we can, okay? We re going to do the best we can. How about the cement masons. (Applause.) And, of course, our wonderful Teamsters. (Applause.) Oh, that wasn t very good, James.But really, you re the backbone of America. With the talent in this room, we could build any city at any time, and we can build it better than anyone. (Applause.) But we re going to do even better than that. Together, we are going to rebuild our nation. (Applause.)You re the keepers of the great trades and traditions that built our country from the New York skyline to the Golden Gate Bridge. You represent the workers whose hands, skills, and dreams will build the great landmarks of our future. Every day, your members live out what I call the American Creed. They re on the job before dawn and after dusk, and they never quit until that job is done. You know that. True. True. (Applause.)We saw this grit on display when the construction trades helped rebuild New York City after 9/11. (Applause.) That was a terrible time   we were all there   that was a terrible time in this country s history. Worst attack in the history of our country. Worse than Pearl Harbor. Pearl Harbor they were attacking military. Here they were attacking civilians. Worst attack. And I saw what happened. Within a very short period of time, we were back rebuilding, and rebuild you did. And I really congratulate   that took a lot of courage and a lot of strength. Thank you. (Applause.)The fact is you take pride in every part of your work   every joist, bolt, and rivet. You re not only builders, but you re artisans, very talented people. A lot of people don t understand, you re very talented people   enriching our cities and landscapes with works of great beauty. And just as you take pride in your work, our nation takes great, great pride in you, believe me. And it s time that we give you the level playing field you deserve. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you.Washington and Wall Street have done very, very well for themselves.Now it s your turn.And you re going to be also sharing the wealth. (Applause.) And you know, for many years, we ve been taken advantage of by other countries. All over the world they took advantage of us. We had leaders that didn t have a clue or worse. That s not going to happen anymore, folks. That s not going to happen anymore. And you see what s going on right now. In fact, the trade deficit went way down   just announced before I got on stage. And I will tell you, we re going to have a whole different set of values when it comes to representing our country.That I can tell you right now. (Applause.)This election was all about returning power to the people. I ve spent my life working side-by-side with American builders, and now you have a builder as your President. (Applause.) One of my first acts as President was to stop one of the great sellouts of the American worker   I immediately withdrew the United States from the disaster   this would have been a disaster   this would have been another NAFTA, which, by the way, is a disaster. I took you out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. (Applause.) Thank you. That one wasn t even close. And you know it and I know it, everybody knows it.Next, I cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines. (Applause.) And it s looking like that s going to have about 42,000 jobs involved, those two jobs. That some number of great people. That s a big, big, beautiful   lot of people. And Sean actually, and a whole group joined me in the Oval Office when we approved the Keystone permit.And I joked that day   I said, can you imagine the head of this big Canadian company, in this case, they build pipelines   and they failed. Didn t work. They paid millions and millions and hundreds of millions of dollars to consultants and lawyers, and they failed. And it was over. And then one day Trump wins, and a few days later they get a knock on the door   sir, the Keystone pipeline was just approved.Can you imagine? I want to see the expression on his face. And he s a nice guy. He actually   they came to the office. (Applause.) Because I did say you have to use American steel, you have to fabricate it here. Now, they had already bought 60-70 percent of it. So you can t be too wild, right? But I was signing the order, and I said, where did they buy this steel? I didn t like the answer. I said, who fabricated the steel? I didn t like the answer. I said, from now on we re going to put a clause   got to be made in America. We want American steel, made in America. (Applause.) Right on the box. 100 percent, right? (Applause.)And you ll be hearing more about this in the very near future. But as time goes by, let s say, over the next seven and three-quarters years   meaning eight years   (laughter.)We believe in two simple rules: Buy American, and Hire American. That s what it s going to be. (Applause.) And that s not just a slogan, it s a promise. Believe me, that s a promise. (Applause.)The era of economic surrender has come to an end. It s come to an end. We have surrendered as a country to outside interests. The era of economic victory for our country has just begun. You will see. No longer will we listen to those failed consultants who ve made one wrong prediction after another   delivering nothing but soaring trade deficits and a big, fat, shrinking workforce.For decades now, we ve watched as our factories have shuttered   almost 70,000 factories   our jobs have been stolen, and blue collar wages have declined. We ve seen the economic pain inflicted on our fellow Americans in Pittsburgh and Detroit and Baltimore. We didn t just offshore our jobs, we offshored a big, big part of the American Dream.We enriched foreign countries at the expense of our own country, the great United States of America. But those days are over. (Applause.) I m not   and I don t want to be   the President of the world. I m the President of the United States. And from now on, it s going to be America First. (Applause.)We re going to bring back our jobs   and, yes, we re going to bring back the American Dream. As I traveled the nation, I heard the pleas of the forgotten men and women of our country   the people who work hard and play by the rules, but who don t have a voice. Together, we are their voice, and they will never, ever be forgotten again. That I can tell you. (Applause.)I don t know if you saw, but if you watch the Democrats now, the anger   the anger and hatred, and they re trying to figure out where did all these people came that voted for Donald Trump? Remember they said   because the Electoral College is a very, very hard, they say, almost impossible for a Republican to win. The odds are stacked. And they would say there s no way to 270   you need 270   there s no way to 270. I heard that so much for a year   I kept saying, maybe I shouldn t be running. You know, Sean, I said, maybe I shouldn t run because there s no way. The people are telling me   the same people that say all of the bad stuff, they re saying, there s no way to 270. But there was a way to 306.But wasn t that an exciting one? Places that nobody entered   Donald Trump has won the state of Michigan. They go, what? Donald Trump has won the state of Wisconsin. They came out of the blue, and we didn t even need them. And we love those two states   because we won the state of Pennsylvania, and we won Ohio, and Iowa, and North Carolina, and South Carolina, and Florida, and so many others. We ran the coast. And if you don t run it, you can t win. Huge disadvantage, Electoral College. It s very, very tough. They say almost impossible for a Republican to win. But I had the support of, I would say, I would say almost everybody in this room.We had tremendous   we had tremendous support. Oh, we did. We had tremendous support. (Applause.) We had tremendous support. And I ll tell you, we really had the support of the workers. We had tremendous support of the workers. But would you like to make a change, folks? Would you like to make a change? Because if anybody wants to make a change, you won t be having so many jobs. That I can tell you. Your jobs will be   it will be a whole different story. Because in the last decade, you lost over 750,000   think of this   750,000 construction jobs. Real wages in the construction sector have fallen more than 15 percent since the 1970s. We rank 39th in the world for construction permitting. And approvals for infrastructure projects can take up to 10 years.Since taking office, I ve signed one action after another to eliminate job-killing regulations that stand in the way. I had a chart   is that chart around here someplace? Do you have that? I have to show this chart to you because it s amazing, actually.This is   if you want to build a highway in the United States, these are some of the permits that you need. It s a process that can take way over 10 years. And it just never happens. Then at the end of the period they vote against it. And we re getting rid of many of these regulations. (Applause.) You have to go through 17 agencies, many permits in each agency.In February alone, we added almost 60,000 new construction jobs in the country. I ordered expedited environmental reviews for infrastructure, environmental and energy projects all across the country. No longer will you have to wait year after year for approvals that never come.I also took historic action to lift the restrictions on American energy production and to put our miners, who have been treated horribly, back to work. (Applause.) They re great people.Consumer confidence is at its highest level in more than a decade. You ve seen all of the charts, all of the studies. The National Association of Manufacturers just the other day reported the most optimism in the entire history of its survey   which is a old survey   93 percent of manufacturers are optimistic about the future. It was almost 27 percent lower than that just a few months ago.The Home Builders Confidence Index is at its highest level in 12 years. And now in breaking news, it was just reported today, the monthly U.S. trade deficit declined by 10 percent   for a reason. Not by accident, believe me. It was for a reason.We re also going to protect your jobs by protecting our borders. My administration is   just a matter of weeks, literally, a short period of time   has brought record reductions to illegal immigration. Record reductions. (Applause.) Down 61 percent since inauguration. General Kelly is doing a fantastic job. And we ll crack down on visa abuses that undermine the American worker. And we re doing that right now. (Applause.)These, and so many other great achievements, have defined our first 10 weeks in office. We ve done so much for the worker. Done so much for the military. We ve done so much for the police officers, our men in blue and women in blue who are not treated fairly. We re fighting for workers of all backgrounds and from all walks of life.But to achieve true progress, we must remember our legacy. We re the nation that built the tallest skyscrapers on what was once the Hudson River, and put neon lights of Las Vegas in the middle of the desert. But if government continues to punish America s builders, then we will not be that nation any longer.I m calling on all Americans   Democrat, Republican, independent   to come together and take part in the great rebuilding of our country. (Applause.)That is why, in my address to Congress, I called on lawmakers to pass legislation that produces a $1-trillion investment in the infrastructure of our country. And we need it. (Applause.) With your help, we can rebuild our country s bridges, airports, seaports, and water systems. We will streamline the process to get approvals quickly, so that long-delayed projects can finally move ahead. And with lower taxes on America s middle class and businesses, we will see a new surge of economic growth and development.All of you have come to the nation s capital to call members of the House and Senate to action. You ve also called your President to action. When you see them, you can tell Congress that America s building trades and its President are very much united. (Applause.)Together, we are ready to break new ground. We will build in the spirit of one of the great projects in our nation s history   an enduring symbol of American strength. The Empire State Building was forged in the Great Depression, and provided jobs for more than 3,000 workers. We ve all seen the pictures   rugged workers perched dozens and dozens of stories up in the air. Workers like these moved almost 60,000 tons of steel, installed 200,000 cubic feet of stone, and laid 10 million bricks to build that American icon. And they did the job in a record time   13 months. Hard to believe. Think of that   the Empire State Building built in 13 months, during the Depression. Nowadays, you couldn t even get a building permit or approval in that amount of time.When the workers had secured the last piece of steel in that amazing and beautiful structure, they marked the moment   as we still do today   with what is called a  topping out  ceremony: 1.050 feet above the streets of New York City, they hoisted a beautiful and great American flag. (Applause.)AUDIENCE MEMBER: The ironworkers!THE PRESIDENT: They did a good job. They did a good   those ironworkers, you better believe it.It was an American flag that represented American projects   the big, bold, and daring dream of one man, and then one city, and then finally, one people. That banner marked our nation s proud climb to the top of the world. Our people endured through the hardships of Depression and the battles of World War II, and they emerged from these trials stronger and more united than ever before. Now, we must again summon that same national greatness to meet the challenges of our time.Only miles from the halls of Congress and the newsrooms of Washington, you will find once-thriving cities marred by empty lots and once-booming industrial towns that have become rusted and are in total disrepair. Standing before me today, in this very hall, are the men and women who, if given the chance, can transform these communities. You are the citizens who can rebuild our cities, revive our industries, and renew our beloved country. And I know you will stop at nothing to get the job done. (Applause.)For the rest of their lives, everyone who worked on the Empire State Building knew when they looked up at that great New York skyline that they had lifted the Stars and Stripes atop the tallest flagpole on Earth, and that somewhere high above the city streets, their place in history was carved into beams of steel.In the future, when we become   the trials   and we are   trials of our times   we too will emerge stronger and more united than ever before. It s happening, you watch. When we rise above the cynics and critics who live only to defend the status quo, and to defend themselves from failure, then we, too, will construct a lasting monument to national greatness.In this future, our nation s workers and craftsmen will look way out at the vast open landscape, and they will build new bridges and new schools and new landmarks, and they will proudly raise up for all to see our bright and beautiful American flag. And when we see that flag, we will remember that we all share one American home, one American heart, and one American destiny.May God bless our nation s builders. May God bless our nation s workers. And may God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.)",politics,"Apr 5, 2017",17260
TRUMP DELIVERS BARN BURNER OF A SPEECH: “Media outlets like CNN and MSNBC are fake news” [Video],"President Trump skipped the White House Correspondents Dinner to hold a rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania He delivered a barn burner of a speech!President Donald Trump railed against the media at a rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on Saturday, just as the annual White House Correspondents  Dinner was set to begin in Washington, DC. This was no mistake! A large group of Hollywood actors and Washington media are consoling each other in a hotel ballroom in our nation s capital right now,  he said.  They are gathered together for the White House Correspondents  Dinner without the president.  He continued:  And I could not possibly be more thrilled than to be 100 miles away from Washington s swamp, spending my evening with all of you and with a much, much larger crowd and much better people. Although presidents typically attend the White House Correspondents Dinner and deliver a monologue, Trump had announced in February he wouldn t participate.To raucous booing from the crowd, Trump trashed outlets such as CNN and MSNBC as  fake news  and called the wider Washington media elite  a disgrace.  He ripped the  totally failing New York Times,  which he said was getting gradually smaller and would soon  look like a comic book.

 Sheriff Joe Arpaio Gets A Brutal Lesson In Why You Don’t Ambush Bernie Sanders’ Wife,"When Jane Sanders visited one of known bigot and champion of racial profiling Sheriff Joe Arpaio s unconstitutional tent prisons, she was appalled. Arpaio doesn t understand the meaning of  cruel and unusual punishment.  He forces prisoners to live in smoldering heat and eat expired foods. Since the majority of his inmates are Hispanic people, Arpaio and his racist freak constituents couldn t care less. They follow a doctrine that embraces prosecuting and jailing people simply for the color of their skin to begin with.Mrs. Sanders ended up in a heated argument with Arpaio, one her senator and presidential candidate husband simply couldn t ignore. According to The New York Times, Sanders railed against Arpaio at a campaign event, laying waste to the man he says ambushed his wife: She asked him about racial profiling, and he didn t have an answer,  Sanders said,  She asked him about conditions in Tent City and other abuses that he has perpetuated, and he didn t have an answer. You know what, he cannot have an answer, because what he is doing is un-American and uncivilized. If elected president, we are going to pass comprehensive immigration reform and a path toward citizenship, whether Mr. Arpaio likes it or not. Sheriff Arpaio has been widely criticized, and rightfully so, for his tactics for keeping his jail stocked with minority inmates. He was even sued by the Justice Department for the illegal racial profiling of Hispanics that leads to traffic stops and arrests, often for misdemeanor offenses white people get tickets for. His intolerance and racism has made him a national spectacle on many occasions. Conservatives love him because he embodies all they aspire to be in life: openly hateful racists who are allowed to look down on people for no reason other than their accent.Senator Sanders had a stern warning for Sheriff Arpaio: It s easy for bullies like Sheriff Arpaio to pick on people who have no power. If I am elected president   the President of the United States does have power. So watch out, Joe. Aside from everything we already know about Bernie Sanders we can add this very useful piece of information: Don t mess with his wife.Featured image from Gage Skidmore ",News,"March 18, 2016",2208
" Trump HUMILIATED, Gets Booed After Telling Construction Workers They Voted For Him (VIDEO)","Trump humiliated himself on Tuesday while speaking to a roomful of construction workers at the North America s Building Trades Unions National Legislative Conference in Washington, D.C. when he claimed that pretty much everyone present voted for him. If you watch the Democrats now the anger, the anger and hatred and they re trying to figure out where did all these people came that voted for Donald Trump?  The Donald said before bragging about his heroic ascendancy to the Oval Office. I had the support of I would say, I would say almost everybody in this room,  Trump bragged.

 DAMNING New Poll Shows A BIG Chunk Of Federal Employees Could Quit Their Jobs If Trump Wins,"It seems that Donald Trump is rather unpopular with the workforce that will have to answer to him if he s elected. Despite the union representing ICE endorsing him, other federal workers in various ederal agencies view Hillary far more favorably than Trump. That s not too terribly surprising. What is surprising, though, is that a number of them may just up and quit their jobs if they find their agencies answering to a President Trump.A large number of them. A recent poll, from a federal publication called Government Executive, surveyed a random sample of 1,085 federal employees across 35 agencies and found that Hillary has a commanding lead over Trump, with 53 percent saying they d vote for her vs. 35 percent saying they d vote for Trump if the election were today.Image via Government ExecutiveBut the more damning statistic was that 27 percent said they would, would consider, or might leave the federal service if Trump was elected. That s compared to 16 percent for Hillary. Nine percent said they didn t know what they d do if Trump was elected, compared to just five percent who said that about Hillary.Image via Government ExecutiveImage via Government ExecutiveFederal employees do tend to lean Democratic in part because their jobs are more secure, and they do better economically, under Democratic presidents rather than Republicans. Donald Trump just adds to the GOP s woes in this area because he s a completely incompetent fool that they allowed to become their nominee.In fact, that s evidenced in another damning part of the poll. Thirty-one percent of respondents feel that Hillary would be very effective at managing federal agencies, whereas only 18 percent feel Trump could do that job very well. Just 27 percent said that Hillary would be  not at all effective  in that arena, compared to a whopping 51 percent who believe that about Trump.Image via Government ExecutiveImage via Government ExecutiveThe federal workforce is made up of more than four million people, including our 1.5 million members of the military. Assuming everyone who resigned was in the civilian workforce, that s well over 700,000 employees who would leave under Trump. Add the military members who could consider early retirement into that, and Trump s in a lot of trouble. At the bare minimum, Trump would have to face a workforce that, by and large, doesn t like him, along with a quick loss of hundreds of thousands employees.As for the rest of the country, the federal workforce would then fill up with Trumpkins, which could make life worse for us even faster. We sooo do not need a federal workforce full of deplorables. That would be deplorable.Sure, Republicans would probably paint that as a good thing because they say we need to shrink the size of the government anyway, but the whole thing could backfire spectacularly depending on which agencies suffered the heaviest losses.But really, we can t blame them for feeling this way. Trump would be the worst president to happen to this country.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images",News,"November 1, 2016",3059

"GERMANY’S Anti-Trump, Open Borders ANGELA MERKEL Sees Re-election Poll Numbers Drop…Orders 100,000 Migrants To Be Deported…By Force If Necessary","In what has to be considered an historic about face, German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced that 100,000 migrants who recently arrived in Germany would be deported.For more than a year following the massive tide of humanity that flooded into Germany from Africa and the Middle East, Merkel stoutly defended her open border policy as being consistent with western values. A million migrants later, and a huge voter backlash due to overburdened local governments and a sky rocketing crime rate, Merkel has changed her tune.On November 9, 2016, Germany s Angela Merkel offered Donald J. Trump a public admonishment following his historic win against pro-amensty Hillary Clinton: Sunday Express:Ordinarily, a politician who tried to pull this off would be toast. But Merkel finds herself in a strong position because the alternatives to her are even worse.Recent polls show her coalition of the CDU/CSU comfortably ahead by 11 points over the Social Democratic Party   the leading left wing party in Germany   by 33-22%. The next strongest party are the Greens who poll at 12% and then the nationalist party AfD at almost 9%. Put simply, the German voter has nowhere else to go now that Merkel has flip flopped on immigration.There is a chance that the left wing parties will poll enough votes to fashion a majority, but given that the Social Democrats are determined to continue with a liberal immigration policy, it isn t likely.Merkel will probably pull off her switcheroo on open borders and win re-election. But she has already accelerated the timetable for a takeover of her country by people with no interest in promoting German or western values and ideas.

WATCH: REMEMBER When President Clinton Took Credit for ENDING NUCLEAR THREATS from North Korea?,"Bill Clinton was falsely confident in his plan to end North Korea s nuclear threat with diplomacy. Over 20 years later, his efforts, along with those of every president succeeding him, have been futile.Every president since Clinton has allowed North Korea s nuclear ambitions to go unchecked. Perhaps now that North Korea allegedly has the capability of striking our mainland, America really needs is a president who is willing to stand up to North Korea s brutal dictator and let him know he s not playing with Barack Obama anymore.Will President Trump be the one to finally put an end to North Korea s threatening rhetoric by refusing to ignore Kim Jong Un s threats?North Korea now has an intercontinental ballistic missile that can range most of the continental U.S., and a new Defense Intelligence Agency assessment suggests that North Korea has successfully miniaturized nuclear warheads for its missiles.In the early 1990s, Clinton faced a growing nuclear threat from North Korea, but he ultimately chose diplomacy and deals over the application of military force. I was determined to prevent North Korea from developing a nuclear arsenal, even at the risk of war,  Clinton wrote in his memoirs. He decided to change course after receiving  a sobering estimate of the staggering losses both sides would suffer if war broke out. Watch Clinton brag about his great success with North Korea:NKorea Flashback: Bill Clinton on his deal with North Korea ""The world will be safer."" Whoops. pic.twitter.com/HDf86yqbEq  Mark Dice (@MarkDice) August 8, 2017Clinton chose the Agreed Framework, promising billions of dollars in aid for a North Korean nuclear freeze. This is a good deal for the United States,  he said at the time.  North Korea will freeze and then dismantle its nuclear program. South Korea and our other allies will be better protected. The entire world will be safer as we slow the spread of nuclear weapons. The North Koreans negotiated in bad faith, however, offering false promises to convince the U.S. to unwittingly subsidize their nuclear program. The country began enriching nuclear material, and North Korea conducted its first nuclear test a little over a decade later. North Korea has since continued its steady march to becoming a fully-armed nuclear power. Evidence suggests that North Korea will achieve its nuclear weapons goals much sooner than analysts and experts previously expected.North Korea advanced its program throughout the Bush and Obama administrations, bringing the U.S. to the risky situation it now faces. North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States,  Donald Trump declared to the White House press pool Tuesday.  They will be met with the fire and fury like the world has never seen. He has been very threatening beyond a normal state, and as I said, they will be met with the fire and fury and, frankly, power the likes of which this world has never seen before. While the casualty count in a North Korean crisis might have been high in the 1990s, the cost of a conflict now that North Korea has nuclear weapons would be in the millions.

 This Touching Moment POTUS Shared With A Hiroshima Survivor Is Why He’ll Be So Sorely Missed (VIDEO),"President Obama s trip to Hiroshima would come and go without an official apology to the Japanese people for dropping hellfire on them to end World War II. The official position of the U.S. government is that the bombings were a necessary evil to end a war with no end in sight, ultimately saving lives and bringing the world back to peace. Just because the President wasn t in a position to apologize doesn t mean that he couldn t be the man we all know and have come to expect him to be.While the president s speech was eloquent, reminding us that the people of Hiroshima were just like you and I, it was a moment he shared with a man who survived the bombing that is catching the attention of the world. In this video by ABC News, you can see President Obama intently listening to the man s story through a translator. At one point the man begins to break down and our President, obviously working off of pure decency and instinct, put his arm around the man and gave him a hug.The Japanese are a proud people who prefer the bow and the handshake, but the elderly gentleman who had been to hell and back seemed grateful that the President of the United States would show him such compassion:Conservatives, who have been demonizing the president s plans to visit the site for weeks now are out in force, condemning the action as an apology rather than a human being connecting with another human being in a display of true compassion, something their shallow, selfish minds can t quite reconcile with.

 GOP Rep Goes Full Racist While Giving RIDICULOUS Reasons For Avoiding Town Hall,"A cowardly Republican gave a racist excuse for why he doesn t want to face his constituents at a town hall.As angry Americans show up to town halls to give their Republican representatives hell over their obsession with repealing the Affordable Care Act, an Illinois Republican has decided that he doesn t care about his constituents enough to take criticism from them in person.Rep. Mike Bost has been largely ducking his constituents by holding tele-town halls that they aren t informed about until the last minute, which means not a lot of people are able to participate. Those that do are dedicated supporters who will agree with everything Bost says without any push back whatsoever. The in-person ones going on around the United States right now are out of control, which means you don t actually get to talk to people and listen, and we re looking for ways to do that,  Bost told The Southern Illinoisan.And then Bost made a racist comparison to describe the angry people who are attending town halls. The amount of time that I have at home is minimal, I need to make sure that it s productive. You know the cleansing that the Orientals used to do where you d put one person out in front and 900 people yell at them? That s not what we need. We need to have meetings with people that are productive. I m not going to have the public town hall meetings, in that respect, because I am busy trying to work on the issue,  Bost continued.  If all you want to do is stand and yell at me   we re not going back and forth. What Bost wants is a town hall where he won t be criticized and won t have to answer the criticism. You know, because Bost and Republicans like him are snowflakes who want to pretend that everyone likes them and what they are doing in Congress.Republicans know that repealing the Affordable Care Act is getting more and more unpopular as their own constituents begin to realize that they will lose their own healthcare.To explain the anger at town halls, Republicans have falsely portrayed their own constituents as out-of-state paid protesters rather than admit that they are wrong to repeal the landmark healthcare program.But as Republicans continue to duck their voters they will only make them angrier in the long run. When the 2018 midterm election comes around they won t be able to avoid the voice of the people then. And they will discover quickly that they made a huge mistake by not facing their constituents when they had a chance.Featured image via St. Louis Public Radio",News,"March 2, 2017",2506
" ‘Tehran’ Tom Cotton Insults U.S. Troops, Tries To Spark War With Iran In Disgraceful Interview (VIDEO)","Nobody has spent more of his political career trying to undermine his own government than Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AK). The Tea Party Republican most known for his borderline treasonous letter he sent to Iran in a shameful attempt to derail sensitive nuclear negotiations between President Obama and Iran s government. His ravings failed to accomplish anything and in recent months he s been relegated to the obscurity he deserves. Until now.On the night of the State of the Union, Cotton went on CNN s  Situation Room  to openly and egregiously spread lies about President Obama, even while a difficult situation was unfolding in Iran. On Tuesday evening, the Navy announced that two of its ships, and 10 U.S. sailors, were being held by the Iranian government after the boats floated into the country s territory.Conservatives rapidly lost their minds, even while details continued to come in suggesting the international incident was minor and, in all likelihood, harmless.The Americans were on a training mission in the Persian Gulf when the riverine boats experienced  a navigational or mechanical difficulty  and appear to have drifted into Iranian waters, according to the Pentagon. Iranian Coast Guard boats brought the vessels to a Revolutionary Guard base on Farsi Island, officials said.U.S. officials said they believe that craft steered off course and that the crew was aided, not captured, by Iranian forces. There doesn t seem to be anything malicious at work on either side,  according to a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the internal assessment.Iran said it was working on releasing the crew members  promptly. No big deal, right? In fact, the very lack of hostilities supports the idea that the tensions between the United States and Iran is cooling off, thanks to President Obama s commitment to negotiations.Not as Sen. Cotton tells it. Speaking straight into the camera, Cotton spews lie after lie. His only agenda, to hurt the president s reputation and provoke a hostile response from Iran.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3j8cFq6vUU]In labeling the ships  captured  and the crew held  hostage,  Cotton is viciously lying about the troops. They weren t taken by force. They aren t gagged and bound somewhere in enemy territory. Their boat experienced difficulties and they were rescued by Iranian ships. They never surrendered. The United States was never asked to  apologize  to the Iranians.But by fear-mongering to score political points, Cotton does risk inflaming tensions. Not that the lives of these men and women register in the deep, dark cavity where Cotton s brain allegedly lives. It s clear that even waiting until the sailors are safely out of Iran is too much to ask for a Republican who is hell-bent on painting the Middle Eastern country as a dangerous enemy.As usual, American soldiers are being used by a Republican to serve his agenda. Secretary of State John Kerry couldn t do an interview with CNN, even if it might have helped Democrats in the polls, he was too busy talking personally with Iranian officials, coordinating the release of these soldiers.So going into tonight s State of the Union, where rhetoric on both sides will be high, ask yourself this: Which politician  supports  the troops more? The one who uses them as bargaining chips to lie his way into better poll numbers or the one who spent the last few hours making sure they get home safely.Feature image via YouTube",News,"January 12, 2016",3463

JUST IN: TRUMP ENDS FREE MONEY TRAIN After Pakistan Refuses To Stop Housing Terrorists…Cuts STUNNING About Of Military Aid ,"The Trump administration on Friday announced the United States will deny Pakistan military aid amounting to $255 million as it expects Islamabad to take decisive action  against terrorists and militants on its soil . The United States does not plan to spend the $255 million in FY 2016 in Foreign Military Financing for Pakistan at this time,  said a spokesperson of the President s National Security Council in a statement to Hindustan Times. The President has made clear that the United States expects Pakistan to take decisive action against terrorists and militants on its soil, and that Pakistan s actions in support of the South Asia Strategy will ultimately determine the trajectory of our relationship, including future security assistance. The Administration continues to review Pakistan s level of cooperation. The statement reflected and sealed the administration s complete disillusionment with Pakistan, which had sought to brazenly disregard the explicit warnings issued by President Donald Trump personally and leading members of his cabinet, such as secretaries James Mattis and Rex Tillerson.Financial Times reported last week that  the Trump administration is considering dropping Pakistan as an ally as it examines tough measures to quell more than 20 terrorist groups it says are based in the country.  Here again, the President who is daily derided and ridiculed by foreign policy  experts  is right, and they are wrong: Pakistan is no ally, and has not been for years. This is a rupture that is much needed and long overdue.President Trump has accused the Pakistani government of  housing the very terrorists that we are fighting. And it s true, with the most notorious of these being Osama bin Laden himself. Journalist Carlotta Gall, who reported from Afghanistan for the New York Times for twelve years, reported in March 2014 that:Soon after the Navy SEAL raid on Bin Laden s house, a Pakistani official told me that the United States had direct evidence that the ISI chief, Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, knew of Bin Laden s presence in Abbottabad. The information came from a senior United States official, and I guessed that the Americans had intercepted a phone call of Pasha s or one about him in the days after the raid.  He knew of Osama s whereabouts, yes,  the Pakistani official told me. The official was surprised to learn this and said the Americans were even more so.He shouldn t have been. It had been obvious for years at that point, and remains obvious, that the Pakistanis had been aiding the same jihadists that the U.S. government has been giving them billions of dollars to fight. This could be the severest blow dealt to Islamabad by this administration if it indeed decided to withhold it,  said a leading US expert on Pakistan, who did not want to be identified.  There is more coming,  the expert added.  IOTWReportThe amount, $255 million, is left over from $1.1 billion aid earmarked for Pakistan in 2016, and which included non-military aid as well. It was cleared for handing over in August, just days before it would lapse as unspent money.First reported by The New York Times, the move to withhold the money, which may not be large but would have signaled US backing, is reported to have come shortly after Pakistan refused to hand over to the Americans an operative of the Haqqani Network apprehended during the rescue of an American-Canadian family in October.The Haqqani Network is an affiliate of Afghan Taliban and works out of Pakistan, inflicting massive casualties on the US-led international coalition in Afghanistan. Frustrated by Islamabad s reluctance to give them, the United States has tied large portions of military aid payments to Pakistan for its actions aimed at debilitating the network.Pakistan, however, has chosen to lose hundreds of millions of dollars in such payments over 2015 and 2016, instead of kicking out the terrorists. And it has lost equity.The Trump administration was clear from the start it wouldn t countenance continuity in ties and aid without real changes.  We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting,  President Donald Trump had said unveiling his new South Asia strategy in August.  But that will have to change, and that will change immediately.   Hindustan Times",politics,"Dec 30, 2017",4355
 Obama Reveals What He Carries In His Pocket Everyday – Conservatives Freak Out (VIDEO),"President Obama carried out his annual YouTube interview on Friday and revealed what he carried around with him each and every day inside his pockets. While normally what s in a person s pockets might be self-explanatory (i.e.,. phone, wallet, etc.) the president is no ordinary person. And the items he carries around aren t ordinary, either. There s also an in-depth explanation for each one of them.Here s Obama in his own words: I stick these in my pocket to remind me of all the people I ve met along the way and the stories they ve told me. So, this is what I had in my pocket today: this is rosary beads Pope Francis gave me that obviously means alot to me cause I so admire him and it makes me think about peace and promoting understanding and ethical behavior. This is a little Buddha that a Buddhist monk gave me. This is a lucky poker chip that s metal that this biker gave me. This is a Hindu statuette of the monkey God Hanuman that a woman gave me. And, I ve got a coptic cross; this is from Ethipia. So, I ve got a whole bunch of this stuff but the reason I showed you these is because I carry them around all the time. President Obama says he s  not superstitious  and reiterated that the real reason he carries them around is because he likes to be reminded of the people who gave him the distinct privilege of being President of the United States.Even though President Obama clearly carries around both a cross and rosary beads from the none other than the Pope himself, the only thing religious extremists can focus on is the Hindu monkey God and little Buddha. Why is that? They somehow think this is evidence that he really is the Antichrist, after all.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Now compare this to what George Bush is known to have had in his pockets. In November 2005, at a roundtable with Latin American reporters, Bush was asked what he carried around with him. Here is how he responded, according to the Associated Press: The president stood up, fished in his pockets, then dramatically pulled his hands out holding nothing but a white handkerchief that he waved playfully in the air. He said:  Es todo. That s it. No dinero. No money. No mas. Nothing else. No wallet.' The joker that he was, he was also asked if he brought a watch, to which he replied: Si, Timex. But I m not supposed to be endorsing products. It s amazing how what s in a president s pockets can reveal what kind of commander-in-chief they are.

BREAKING: DETROIT NEWS REPORTS Potential New Evidence Of Massive Vote Tampering,"Detroit elections officials waited several days to deliver nearly 100 poll books to Wayne County officials charged with certifying the presidential election, newly released documents show.County clerk officials on Thursday released a memo to State Elections Director Chris Thomas that said 95 poll books from the 662 precincts weren t available at the start of the canvass, which began the day after the Nov. 8 election. Five of those poll books, which contain the names of voters and ensure the integrity of elections, were never delivered to county canvassers and presumably remain missing.The revelation comes atop other irregularities that have prompted a state audit. Among other issues, The Detroit News reported this week that voting machines registered more votes than they should have in one-third of all city precincts. I m not happy with how Detroit handled this election at all,  said Krista Hartounian, chairwoman of the Wayne County Board of Canvassers, which certified the election. We had been seeing improvement, but this one was different. This one was off. Canvassers compare poll books with printouts from voting machines to ensure the number of people who signed in to vote match the number of ballots cast.In heavily Democratic Detroit, the numbers didn t match in 392 of 662 precincts or 59 percent. The discrepancies emerged during a statewide presidential recount that began last week and ended Friday following a decision by the Michigan Supreme Court.It s unclear how many extra votes were counted in Detroit. That s because tallies were off by five or more votes in 52 Detroit precincts, but county officials will not release the exact number of discrepancies in each precinct.Read more: Detroit News",left-news,"Dec 15, 2016",1728
" Trump White House Is About To Screw Up Easter For 1,000s Of Little Children","If you re keeping track, so far, Donald Trump has screwed up two military missions, his plan to repeal and replace Obamacare, his tax plan, and now, Easter.Just days before Christians  most holy day, the Trump White House still is not preoared for the annual easter egg hunt on the White House lawn. While this is symbolic, it s a big symbol.The Sunday tradition is 138 years old, and as Melinda Bates, the Easter event organizer behind President Bill Clinton s eight times as host, told The New York Times,  It s the single most high-profile event that takes place at the White House each year, and the White House and the first lady are judged on how well they put it on.  From her perspective, the outcome of the event is an indication of the administration s inner workings.Source: SalonFor this we can blame the First Lady   no, not the First Daughter First Lady   Melania. First Ladies have a job in this country and the Easter Egg hunt is one of them.

About 4,000 school children receive tickets every year and about 3,000 children of military familes. They may all be disappointed. Unfortunately, the Trump administration has not reached out about it,  Ashley Broadway-Mack, the president of the American Military Partner Association told the Times. Congress members have also not been contacted about tickets for their constituents.Because of this, the event has been cut in half and they ll only have about 1/5th of the security, and it s all because the First Lady has been neglegent in even staffing her office. She named a chief of staff and social secretary in early February but has yet to announce a director for the Visitors Office, normally the crucial player in the daunting execution of the event,  the Times reported.The vacant positions are cause for concern, according to Bates.  I m really concerned for the Trump people. This thing is all hands on deck.

Once the Supreme Court ruled that marriage equality was the law of the land, anti-gay bigots had to take their fight elsewhere. Besides, gay marriage might not be so bad if you don t actually have to see people *gasp* holding hands or *I feel faint* kissing. What s a better way to keep people out of the public than to ban them from using public restrooms?If you think this is a bit of a stretch, think about the bathroom laws themselves. Imagine a very masculine looking man, who happened to have been born with a vagina. Do women, who already see predators around every corner, really want to share a bathroom with him? Should a woman, feminine in every way except for what s between her legs, be forced to use the men s room? Of course not. Anti-LGBT conservatives don t want them to use the bathroom at all, just like Briscoe Cain s opponent doesn t want him in bathrooms.Yes, this is just one person, but this guy (unfortunately, not a Republican) feels that gay people should have their own bathrooms. You know, separate, but equal.Here are a few more charmers:Keep the freaks, perverts, and Fags out of the bathrooms!! https://t.co/owUwDcjhGz  Lisa Smith (@JuliaKi96952130) May 9, 2016 i m not against gender neutral bathrooms, but can we get a faggot only restroom?For all the fags.

CLASSLESS MICHELLE OBAMA Hits Trump With Outright Lie In Interview With Oprah [Video],"Michelle Obama fed her husband s feud with Donald Trump on Friday as she gave a gloomy description of the hopeless climate his election win has created.

 93 Percent Of The Great Barrier Reef Is Nearly Dead Because Of Climate Change,"In the book, The World is Blue: How Our Fate and the Ocean s are One, Marine Biologist Sylvia Earle wrote: Even if you never have the chance to see or touch the ocean, the ocean touches you with every breath you take, every drop of water you drink, every bite you consume Everyone, everywhere is inextricably connected to and utterly dependent upon the existence of the sea. A report released this week discovered roughly 93 percent of the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, the largest living structure on Earth, has been damaged due to coral bleaching. We ve never seen anything like this scale of bleaching before,  said Professor Terry Hughes in a press release. Professor Hughes is Director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, and leader of the National Coral Bleaching Task Force which produced the report.  In the northern Great Barrier Reef, it s like 10 cyclones have come ashore all at once. The task force evaluated 911 coral reefs by air around Australia, and found 93 percent were suffering from coral bleaching to some extent. The bleaching was found to be worse in the northern sector of the reef, where no coral has escaped its impact. Based on diving surveys, the researchers say they have seen nearly 50 percent coral death so far.According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, part of the United States Department of Commerce, increased ocean temperatures caused by climate change are the leading cause of coral bleaching. Coral depends on algae to survive, which is very sensitive to temperature changes. If warm temperatures remain constant for a long period of time, the coral dispels the algae, leaving it colored white, and eventually leading to the death of the coral if the stresses are prolonged. In 2005, the United States lost half its coral reefs in the Caribbean Sea due to a massive bleaching event. High carbon emissions absorbed by the ocean also decrease Ph levels, leading to ocean acidification. Observation stations monitored by the US EPA in Hawaii, Bermuda, and the Canary Islands found that in the past two decades, carbon dioxide levels in the oceans have increased, directly resulting in the acidification. These changes also put stresses on marine life, diminishing the quality of their habitats and depleting food sources. If emissions aren t reduced soon, the negative effects already being seen in these environments will be irreversible. The bleaching doesn t necessarily mean the coral is dead, but the greater the stressors causing coral bleaching, the less likely the coral is able to recover.  It can take thousands of years for coral reefs to fully form, so once the coral dies, those ecosystems are unlikely to ever recover. This is, by far, the worst bleaching they ve seen on the Great Barrier Reef,  Mark Eakin, director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration s Coral Reef Watch, in an interview with the Washington Post.  Our climate model-based Four Month Bleaching Outlook was predicting that severe bleaching was likely for the [Great Barrier Reef] back in December. Unfortunately, we were right and much of the reef has bleached, especially in the north. Today on Earth Day, it is important to acknowledge and fully comprehend how dire the situation of our world s ecosystems are because of climate change. There is no time for incremental efforts. We must either make the necessary changes to mitigate the effects of climate change in the future now, or pay dearly for the consequences which will manifest exponentially in the near future. We can no longer treat our Earth as a source of infinite economic development when the resources on it are finite.Featured Image Courtesy of Flickr",News,"April 22, 2016",3703

 McDonald’s Brings Conservatives’ Nightmares To Life With New Ad That Has Them Fuming (VIDEO/TWEETS),"Over the past few months, McDonalds has been a target for protests in favor of the fast food franchise raising its minimum hourly wage. Now, the company has once again angered the public  but for a much more noble cause.This time, McDonald s is taking hits from anti-gay religious groups that are absolutely fuming after McDonald s Taiwan posted an LGBT-friendly advertisement for McCafe onto its Facebook page.The ad, which features a young man coming out to his father, is 90 seconds of pure emotion, capturing a moment that is extremely scary and heart-wrenching for many LGBT youth and adults. In the ad, the young man passes a coffee cup to his father that says,  I like boys.  The father gets upset and jumps up from the table, leaving his son alone and fighting back tears. A few seconds later the father returns, picks up the same cup of coffee and writes on it  I accept that you like boys, as translated by the Shanghaiist.Watch the subtitled ad called  Acceptance  below:The ad touched the hearts of many and went viral, with over 3.6 million views, more than 92,000 likes and thousands of shares. Unfortunately, not everyone enjoyed or appreciated the ad s accepting and equality-driven message. Chang Shou-yi, the secretary general of the Alliance of Taiwan Religious Groups for the Protection of Family, is actually calling for a boycott on the restaurant after seeing the ad. Shou-yi said: Because McDonald s is frequented by many children, it is especially important to oppose the promotion of same-sex behavior. The secretary general added that the religious group  rebukes and boycotts all enterprises that are polluting the next generation. Now, even if you want to just take a leak at a McDonald s bathroom, you can t help but feel polluted. But regardless of the backlash against the ad, the social media response has been extremely supportive:TwitterFacebookIf religious groups want to keep opposing businesses that support LGBT rights, they re going to have very limited places to do business with   it s a list that keeps getting shorter as the world moves further away from bigotry and the hateful conservative rhetoric. Even Chick-fil-A, a brand that infamously boasted its opposition to gay marriage, has a franchisee that donated food to a gay pride picnic last year.

TED CRUZ Demands We Put Immediate Halt On Plans To Bring Refugees With Terror Ties To America,"Thank God America has people like Ted Cruz in our Senate, who are unafraid speak out against the enemy, and fight for the safety and security of our nation. Now, if we could only get our  Commander in Chief  to accurately identify and confront the enemy America must stand with our allies against the scourge of radical Islamic terrorism. This is an evil that does not discriminate between French, German or American, Christian, Muslim or Jew, soldier, football player, or concert goer. Their only goal is to murder those who do not submit to their vicious, totalitarian ideology. Our deepest condolences go out to our French allies, and I know the government of the United States stands by to offer any assistance necessary. We must now face the facts. Between the downing of the Russian jet over Egypt and this massive coordinated attack on Paris, we are seeing an unmistakable escalation of ISIS  ambitions and the scale of their terrorist attacks outside Syria and Iraq. Even as chaos rages in Paris, we need to take immediate, commonsense steps to preserve our own safety. We need to consult closely with our NATO allies who may be targeted for additional attacks. We need to immediately declare a halt to any plans to bring refugees that may have been infiltrated by ISIS to the United States. We need to redouble our efforts to prevent ISIS agents from penetrating our nation by other means. Such steps, however, are defensive reactions to an enemy that will continue to try to attack us until they succeed once again. We must immediately recognize that our enemy is not  violent extremism.  It is the radical Islamism that has declared jihad against the west. It will not be appeased by outreach or declarations of tolerance. It will not be deterred by targeted airstrikes with zero tolerance for civilian casualties, when the terrorists have such utter disregard for innocent life. We must make it crystal clear that affiliation with ISIS and related terrorist groups brings with it the undying enmity of America that it is, in effect, signing your own death warrant.

 Hillary Clinton Shuts Down GOP Lawmaker Rudely Heckling Her At Town Hall Event (VIDEO),"A Republican lawmaker in New Hampshire showed up to one of Hillary Clinton s town hall events in the state on Sunday and apparently thought it would be smart to heckle Mrs. Clinton. Bad idea. Not only did it not work out as planned, but the former Secretary of State called out the state representative in front of everyone. You are very rude, and I m not ever going to call on you. Thank you. The comment earned Mrs. Clinton an enormous round of applause, as the heckler just stood there continuing to point her finger at Hillary while waving her hands like a crazy person. It s these kinds of tactics that don t go over so well. Perhaps there s a better way to get your message across?So, what exactly was Katherine Prudhomme O Brien, the GOP state representative from Rockingham, trying to say? She followed up with a reporter after the event and was mad that Hillary didn t want to talk about Bill Clinton s past marital infidelities from decades ago. Really? That s what was so important? I asked her how in the world she can say that Juanita Broderick and Kathleen Wiley are lying when she has no idea who Juanita Broderick is. She told me this summer she doesn t know who she is and doesn t want to know who she is. How can she access that they are lying, which she told someone last month? Expect for more below-the-belt tactics like these now that Bill Clinton is set to make his first appearance on the campaign trail starting on Monday. Republicans are looking for any and every chance to use Bill s past indiscretions against Hillary. It s the kind of dirty campaign tactics that people claim cause them to hate politics, yet somehow they still get the most attention.With that said, Bernie Sanders, unlike Republicans, doesn t intend on bringing up Bill Clinton s sexual past anytime soon: No, I think we ve got more important things to worry about in this country than Bill Clinton s sex life.

"BREAKING! MASSIVE VOTER FRAUD INVESTIGATION…Spokesperson For Voter Registration Project: Police Raid “Will Have Prevented 45,000 African Americans From Voting” [VIDEO]","LOL! This group gets raided for suspicion of massive voter fraud, and their defense is that the Republican Secretary of State and (of course) the police, are responsible for preventing 45,000 African Americans from voting? And you know what s even scarier? Indiana s not even a state that should be in play for the Democrats. Just imagine how they ve been organizing in the swing states where the vote is expected to be close. Pretty scary stuff Indiana police raided the offices of the Indiana Voter Registration Project in north Indianapolis on Tuesday in a growing voter fraud case.It is not clear who established or funded the Indiana Voter Registration Project. However, the group released a statement through spokeswoman Christy Setzer, whose PR firm s website says she has worked as a Democratic strategist for the presidential campaigns of Al Gore, Howard Dean and Chris Dodd. Indiana State Police investigators on Tuesday searched a voter registration agency on Indianapolis  north side as they look into a voter fraud case that spans nine counties.The investigation began in late August when police learned of the filing of fraudulent voter registration forms in Marion and Hendricks counties.The investigation has expanded from Marion and Hendricks counties to include Allen, Delaware, Hamilton, Hancock, Johnson, Lake and Madison counties, according to a statement from State Police.Police said the growing number of involved counties leads investigators to believe that the number of fraudulent records might be in the hundreds. An investigation of this nature is complex, time consuming and is expected to continue for several more weeks or months,  said a State Police statement.  Victims of the activities by some agents of the Indiana Voter Registration Project may not discover they have been disenfranchised from voting until they go to vote and realize their voting information has been altered. Such action may result in the citizen having to cast a provisional ballot. Officials said a representative sample of voter registration applications received by county voter registration offices and suspected of being fraudulent have been copied and provided to investigators. The original applications are maintained by the appropriate voter registration office.The possible fraudulent information is a combination of fake names, addresses and dates of birth with real information.

TWO ILLEGAL ALIENS TO BECOME FIRST APPOINTED CITY COMMISSIONERS: Hope To Create More Opportunities For Illegals,"Is there really any point to go through the work and expense to become an American citizen anymore?Huntington Park may become the first city in California to appoint two undocumented immigrants as commissioners on city advisory boards, a lawmaker confirms.City Councilman Jhonny Pineda has picked Francisco Medina to join the health and education commission and Julian Zatarain for the parks and recreation commission.The 32-year-old lawmaker told CBSLA online producer Deborah Meron that he promised voters while running for office that he would create more opportunities for undocumented residents. Huntington Park is a city of opportunity and a city of hope for all individuals regardless of socioeconomic status, race, creed, or in this case, citizenship,  the councilman said in a statement.  Both these gentlemen have accomplished a great deal for the city. For that, on behalf of the city council, mayor, and our city, I want to say thank you to them both and I am confident they will do an excellent job on their commission posts. Pineda says he cleared the appointments with the city attorney, who confirmed there s nothing that requires a commissioner to be a registered voter, a documented citizen or even a resident, which technically means someone here without legal residency can serve.Appointees first pass a LifeScan background check.Medina and Zatarain would not be paid for the volunteer positions and would not have a direct hand in constructing policy but would help advise the council on legislation. Other commissioners receive a $75 monthly stipend on months when they hold meetings.Coming the same year that California allowed residents to apply for a driver s license, regardless of immigration status, this move is the latest in an effort to recognize an increasingly sizable demographic in the state.Pineda says at 13 years old he emigrated alone to the United States. He established legal residency and told Meron he feels blessed to have been able to come here and work. He s served as a district representative on the California State Senate and legislative assistant for the U.S. House of Representatives. He currently is president of the California Latino Leadership Institute, an organization designed for young professionals interested in leadership development and serving their community.A graduate from Cal State Dominguez Hills with a bachelor s degree in sociology and Chicano studies, Medina interned for then-Assemblyman Gil Cedillo, who now serves on the Los Angeles City Council, Pineda says.

OOPS! LIST OF TOP 10 CORPORATE TAX DODGERS Are All Hillary Donors…Compliments Of Bernie Sanders,"The hypocrisy of our media is astounding! What about Hillary s major corporate donors like GE for example, that have been working the loopholes in our tax system for decades? Does anyone care that Hillary has been taking money from some of America s biggest corporate tax dodgers for several years? Bernie Sanders recently outed the 10 biggest multinational corporations that paid no federal taxes for at least one year between 2008 and 2012. Sanders has made reining in corporate tax dodgers a key point of his presidential platform. In a recent press release, the Sanders campaign laid out the Vermont senator s plans to force multinational corporations to pay their fair share in taxes:As it turns out, all ten of those same companies are some of Hillary Clinton s biggest donors, whether to her campaign or to her family foundation.1. GENERAL ELECTRIC According to data from the nonpartisan group Citizens for Tax Justice (CTJ), GE posted $33.9 billion in U.S. profits, yet somehow got $2.9 billion in refunds in that same time period. According to the book Clinton Cash, then-Secretary of State Clinton lobbied the Algerian government for a GE power plant contract. After Algeria awarded the contract to GE, Jeffrey Immelt   CEO of GE   gave a donation to the Clinton Foundation. Sanders also pointed out that while Immelt sat on the board of the New York Federal Reserve, the Fed gave GE $16 billion in financial assistance.2. BOEING Boeing is one of the nation s biggest corporate tax dodgers, making over $20 billion in profits between 2008 and 2012 and paying an overall income tax rate of negative one percent during those years. Clinton Cash author Peter Schweizer noted that after Secretary Clinton successfully lobbied the Russian government to enter into a $3.7 billion contract to buy Boeing s aircraft, the aerospace company gave the Clinton Foundation a hefty donation of $900,000.3. VERIZON In the four years between 2008 and 2012, Verizon pocketed over $30 billion in profits and paid a tax rate of -1.8 percent, according to CTJ. The Sanders campaign s research claims that in 2012 alone, Verizon would have paid $630 million in income taxes had they been unable to stash U.S. profits in offshore tax havens.Verizon has given between $118,000 and $300,000 to the Clinton Foundation in recent years. And as Zaid Jilani reported in Alternet last year, Hillary Clinton is the favored candidate of numerous Verizon executives, many of whom have given the maximum donation to her 2016 effort:Verizon vice-presidents Lydia Pulley, Kathleen Grillo, and Donna Epps each gave $2,700 to Hillary for America. Verizon senior vice-president Thomas Edwards and vice-president Chris Debosier pitched in $1,000. Leecia Eve, a former Hillary staffer who today is a lobbyist for Verizon gave $2,700. Another Verizon lobbyist, David Lamendola, gave Hillary $1,000.To contrast, Sanders appeared at a rally for striking Verizon workers in New York City last year, demanding the company meet the workers  demands and admonishing its executives for the company s greedy practices.4. BANK OF AMERICA In 2010, Bank of America got a whopping $1.9 billion refund from the IRS despite making $4.4 billion in profit. And the Institute for Policy Studies reported that Bank of America has over 300 foreign subsidiaries in countries and territories universally known as tax havens, like the Cayman Islands and Bermuda.In his recent groundbreaking report for The Intercept, Jilani reported that Bank of America paid Hillary Clinton $225,000 in speaking fees after her tenure as Secretary of State.5. CITIGROUP Citigroup was the largest recipient of federal bailout money, getting an astonishing $2.5 trillion after the financial crisis even though they played a major role in the financial meltdown. Citi also paid $0 in federal income taxes in 2010 despite making profits in excess of $4 billion. Had the bank been unable to utilize offshore tax havens, it would have paid $11.5 billion in federal taxes in 2012.According to campaign finance database OpenSecrets.org, Citigroup is Hillary Clinton s top donor, having given over $824,000 in campaign contributions throughout her political career.6. PFIZER The Connecticut-based pharmaceutical giant is notorious for its tax avoidance strategies, paying $0 in federal income tax between 2010 and 2012 and getting a $2.2 billion tax refund despite posting $43 billion in global profits.Pfizer executives gave nearly $40,000 to Clinton s presidential campaign between April and September 2015. And Pfizer itself has given between $1 million and $5 million to the Clinton Foundation, according to donor records obtained by the Washington Times.7. FEDEX In 2011, FedEx made $2.7 billion in profit, yet they were given a $135 million tax refund from the IRS that same year. FedEx also receives $1 billion a year in corporate welfare from the U.S. Post Office   its chief competitor   to use its aircraft to transport U.S. mail.FedEx has given anywhere between $100,000 and $250,000 to the Clinton Foundation. The company was also one of four corporations to bundle a $2.5 million donation to Clinton s new diplomacy center (Boeing was another).8. HONEYWELL Despite making over $3 billion in combined profits between 2009 and 2010, Honeywell paid $0 in federal income taxes and got roughly $510 million in refunds. Honeywell CEO David Cote was also one of the loudest voices on the Fix The Debt campaign, calling for the Social Security and Medicare age to be raised to 70.Honeywell, a prominent weapons manufacturer, also gave $50,000 to the Clinton Foundation while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State. At the same time, Honeywell and others had their weapons shipped to countries blasted by international watchdogs for their deplorable records on human rights.9. MERCK Merck is one of the nation s largest pharmaceutical companies and biggest tax dodgers   in 2009, Merck pocketed $5.7 billion in profits, yet paid $0 in federal taxes. Merck successfully got out of paying $18.69 billion in federal taxes in 2012 by stashing $53.4 billion of its U.S. profits in overseas tax havens.The Center for Responsive Politics reports that Merck donated between $250,000 and $500,000 to the Clinton Foundation after becoming a member of the Clinton Global Initiative in 2006. It also spent millions on lobbying the U.S. State Department during Hillary Clinton s tenure as Secretary of State.10. CORNING CTJ reports that between 2008 and 2012, Corning made over $3.4 billion in profits and got a $10 million tax refund, paying a 0.1 percent federal tax rate. The Sanders campaign pointed out that Corning CEO Wendell Weeks has called for the retirement age to be raised to 70, while he himself has a $22.8 million retirement account.While Clinton headed up the State Department, Corning lobbied heavily for multiple policies on which it stood to reap financial gains, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Clinton, in turn, lobbied China to lower tariffs on the type of goods manufactured by Corning. The company has also donated between $100,000 and $250,000 to the Clinton Foundation and paid the former Secretary of State $225,000 in speaking fees after she announced her presidential campaign.

Instead, according to the The Daily Sentinel:That posting not only prompted calls of her resignation from fellow Delta County Republicans, but also from several outside groups, including the Colorado branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the Greater Metro Denver Ministerial Alliance.Whoops.In the face of all of this pressure, Sorenson changed her story from,  I m racist and I m proud!  to the perennial favorite of politicians who make a social media blunder:  Someone hacked my account! I m the victim here! After four  accountability meetings  though, including an investigation into Sorenson violating party rules by endorsing a local Republican primary candidate, Sorenson saw the writing on the Facebook wall and resigned. The Republicans Central Committee was quick to distance themselves:Suppes, who is not a member of the central committee, said it was an appropriate move. There s no room for racism, intended or unintended, in society,  he said.  It s best for the party, best for the county, that she step down. On the one hand, bravo to the Colorado GOP for dealing with this appropriately. On the other, Sorenson is hardly an outlier. Republicans have spent decades turning their party into a haven for racism and bigotry in all its many forms. Sorenson was simply stupid enough to say it out loud; a trend that has been exacerbated, but certainly not started, by Donald Trump.I wonder who she ll blame for her downfall?

REDUX 1963? The Deep State vs Donald Trump,"Patrick Henningsen 21st Century WireWatching this week s Senate cabinet confirmation hearings was one of the most uncomfortable sights I have ever witnessed in politics. One self aggrandizing US Senator after another, each spouting out half-truths and speaking in innuendo and supposition   as if it were historical fact. The level of ignorance about world events was breathtaking. Key foreign policy cabinet nominees were Rex Tillerson for Secretary of State, General James Mattis for Defense Secretary, and Mike Pompeo for CIA director. All three men were grilled by a pride of chickenhawks and self-styled foreign policy experts like Senator Roger Wick (R), Marco Rubio (R), Bob Menendez (D) and of course, by Washington s twin neoconservative ventriloquists, John McCain (R) and Lindsey Graham (R).Particularly disturbing was the chicken-hawkish bullying by Marco Rubio of Tillerson, where the Florida Senator demanded that a future Secretary of State adopt the bellicose language of the war-monger when describing the Russian President. YOU MUST COMPLY: Nominee Rex Tillerson is trolled by Senator Marco Rubio.Regarding events in Syria that Rubio believes are war crimes, but of which there is zero evidence, Rubio asked,  Is Vladimir Putin a war criminal? Tillerson replied,  I would not use that term. Rubio went on to list things he s seen on the internet and CNN about Putin s  attacks on civilians  and accused the Russian leader of killing political opposition leaders and journalists.Tillerson replied saying,  I would want to have much more information before reaching a conclusion,  and he called Rubio s accusations, very serious charges.  That would be the mature answer. But Rubio wanted Tillerson to comply. I find it discouraging your inability to cite that, which I think is globally accepted,  Rubio replied.It was a disgusting display of arrogance and propaganda laundering by Rubio, like the other trolling Senators   demanding that Russia must be our enemy and we must retaliate to a  election hack which never happened. In this new environment of irrationality and avarice, if you resist, and if you choose diplomacy and base your views on facts, then you are un-American. This seems to be the current culture in Washington and the mainstream media: compliance to group think   and these Senate hearings showed just how far US officials are willing to go to enforce compliance on all major issues   complying on Israel, on Putin, and on the supremacy of the  intelligence community. One of the only voices brave enough to speak up about the sordid scene in the Senate was California Representative Dana Rohrabacher (R), who said during a recent radio interview that  warmongers  like Rubio are sabotaging potential future relations with Russia by calling Putin a  war criminal. All of this follows the other regressive trend   the crypto-fascist talking point that has been advanced in recent weeks by the likes of Wolf Blitzer and other mainstream news anchors, all of whom have insinuated that if Trump or anyone else does not swallow the entire DNI Intelligence Assessment on the  Russian Hack    then they are somehow  disrespecting the institution  of the CIA or any other so-called intelligence body, or even worse, that they are unpatriotic. Why won t the President-Elect accept the findings of the intelligence community?!  crowed CNN s Blitzer and other   practically brow-beating guests who appeared on the network. It s as if the only acceptable answer was total submission. For those who are old enough to remember, this is a repeat of the Iraq War deception in 2003. Low and behold, the same media operatives and political demons have been deployed to police a similar group-think regime in 2016. That should be a clue to anyone pay attention, that we are witnessing another scam.The following commentary may seem a bit far-fetched on the surface, but when you consider everything that has already gone down over the last 4 months in US politics, then the probability of another black swan event doesn t seem so far-flung. It s important to put this into historical context, and do a comparative analysis with John F Kennedy s Bay of Pigs defeat   a seminal event in US geopolitics and a major set-back for the Deep State at the time, and one that was blamed on JFK s inability to facilitate a CIA win in Cuba. A number of prominent historians and researchers have credited that defeat, along with Kennedy s desire to break-up the CIA as a primary motive for JFK s assassination. When you consider this against the present day back-drop of President Obama s 5 year failure of a proxy war to overthrow the Syrian government   a war which Hillary Clinton herself instituted, there are a number a striking parallels between then and now. More striking yet, is Donald Trump s public calls to  reorganise  the intelligence agencies   a move which threatens the very fabric of the contemporary Deep State which runs Washington and the Atlanticist alliance.In so many ways, Trump might be viewed as a moral enemy of the Deep State that has been allowed to reign unhindered by any real oversight, and accountable only to itself.The danger seems palatable, so much so that some establishment journalists are breaking ranks by talking openly about the  Deep State    a topic previously reserved for the fringes of political and geopolitical commentary and certainly not acceptable for debate on a mainstream broadcast TV network. The Intercept s Glenn Greenwald has recently written a piece which outlines this very scenario  where the Deep State has declared war on Donald Trump, and if Trump continues to push back against these institutions, the consequences could be dire. Greenwald focused on the recent fake  Trump-Russia dossier  which he stated was the work of the Intelligence Community. Looking at these last two weeks, it is clear that such a progression of events has been advanced already: The serious dangers posed by a Trump presidency are numerous and manifest. There is a wide array of legitimate and effective tactics for combating those threats: from bipartisan congressional coalitions and constitutional legal challenges to citizen uprisings and sustained and aggressive civil disobedience. All of those strategies have periodically proven themselves effective in times of political crisis or authoritarian overreach. But cheering for the CIA and its shadowy allies to unilaterally subvert the U.S. election and impose its own policy dictates on the elected president is both warped and self-destructive. Empowering the very entities that have produced the most shameful atrocities and systemic deceit over the last six decades is desperation of the worst kind. Demanding that evidence-free, anonymous assertions be instantly venerated as Truth   despite emanating from the very precincts designed to propagandize and lie   is an assault on journalism, democracy, and basic human rationality. And casually branding domestic adversaries who refuse to go along as traitors and disloyal foreign operatives is morally bankrupt and certain to backfire on those doing it. By demonizing Russia, and then tying Donald Trump to that country, the establishment has accomplished its mission in ruining the so-called  peaceful transition of power.  Interestingly, this bizarre phrase was really only introduced by US media operatives this past fall, and for a reason. Now we can see why.Consider what we are seeing to play-out right now   a political free-for-all, where the level of hate and irrational vitriol which has been intentionally built-up over, and is unprecedented in modern history.Based on the events we have seen over the past two months   the Democrat-organized street protests and call to abolish the Electoral College, Democrat intimidation of electors, the pseudo recount  by the Democratic Party and their willing agent Jill Stein, the evidence-free DNI Report on the alleged  Russian Hack,  and the fake  Trump-Russia Blackmail  dossier, as well as radical left-wing plans to  shut down next week s inauguration and block the transfer of power in Washington  you can be absolutely certain that the losing party will not give up and have yet to unveil some more audacious plans  designed to disrupt and possibly unseat the new 45th President of the United States, Donald J Trump.    The campaign to delegitimize this incoming President has been carefully coordinated through multiple actors; the corporate media (led by CNN, MSNBC, the New York Times, Washington Post and The Guardian), the Hillary Clinton campaign, the Democratic Party, Soros-funded NGOs like MoveOn.org, the McCain-Graham faction, and quietly helped along by the White House. Theoretically speaking, and taken into context with the previous paragraph   the level of Anti-Trump public hate is so over-the-top and intense right now that (heaven forbid) should some untimely incident, either accidental or intentional, befall the new President  then the American left and its cadre of stakeholders are certain to celebrate openly and gleefully. Such an incident would invariably be followed by the proverbial,  Oh well, he had it coming. This is a high stakes game  much bigger in fact than any one man, or political party. Everything is at stake: NATO, the military industrial complex, the CIA, and the existence and primacy of a globalist Deep State that has ruled the US and the world since WWII. In short, the World Order, as seen by those who control the transatlantic system of international geopolitics, trade and commerce.This should be viewed as a very sensitive matter. It goes without saying that such an incident and its predictable, engineered left-wing reaction  would inevitably trigger the beginnings of bona fide civil war in the United States.Will Trump be able to hang a wonderful new sign in the window at Pennsylvania Ave which reads,  Change of Management ?  Not if Congress and the Deep State prefers the old management.The following analysis by Zero Hedge, featuring a segment with Tucker Carlson and Glenn Greenwald expands on this possibility, and provides a number evidence points which mark what could be seen as a progression of events   leading to a dystopic conclusion . Zero Point NowJournalist Glenn Greenwald, who is not a fan of President-elect Trump, appeared on Tucker Carlson tonight to discuss the dangerous ongoing effort among powerful anti-Trump factions within the US Government s  Deep State, who have collaborated with members of the Democratic Party and the traditionally liberal media to inflict maximum damage on the incoming President. Recall Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer s ominous  six ways from Sunday  comment from 10 days ago.Greenwald, an accomplished litigator, journalist, and author, does a masterful job illustrating the players, motives, and potential fallout from this dangerous effort within the US Government s intelligence apparatus. Greenwald goes deep, discussing how Trump s election ruined the plan for regime change in Syria, specifically mentioning, among other things, that the deep state was waiting for Obama to leave office before executing their plan: The number one foreign policy priority of the CIA over the last four to five years has been the proxy war they re waging in Syria to remove Bashar Al Assad  and Hillary Clinton was quite critical of Obama for constraining them. She wanted to escalate that war to unleash the CIA, to impose a no-fly zone in Syria to confront Russia, whereas Trump took the exact opposite position. He said we have no business in Syria trying to change the government, we ought to let the Russia and Assad go free and killing ISIS and Al Qaeda and whoever else they want to kill. He [Trump] was a threat to the CIA s primary institutional priority of regime change in Syria. Beyond that, Clinton wanted a much more confrontational and belligerent posture towards Moscow, which the CIA has been acrimonious with for decades, whereas Trump wanted better relations. They viewed Trump as a threat to their institutional pre-eminence to their ability to get their agenda imposed on Washington. What you re seeing is actually quite dangerous. There really is at this point obvious open warfare between this un-elected, but very powerful faction that resides in Washington and sees Presidents come and go   on the one hand, and the person that the American democracy elected to be elected on the other. There s clearly extreme conflict and subversion taking place. This really is a must-watch, and goes hand-in-hand with Tucker s interview with Dr. Stephen Cohen this week:  .This is overt, and Schindler also just more or less outed Washington Post s David Ignatius as a CIA mouthpiece (along the same vein as Deep Throat, perhaps we can refer to Ignatius s source as Golden Shower?).READ MORE RUSSIAN HACK NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Russian Hack FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE   SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER@ 21WIRE.TV",US_News,"January 15, 2017",12941
 Trevor Noah Dropkicks Donald Trump With A Truly Brutal One-Liner (VIDEO),"Republican frontrunner Donald Trump is leading the pack by appealing to the very worst aspects of human nature, and the battle is on the find the sentence that truly expresses the horror and contempt this news generates in the rest of us. We think Trevor Noah might just have found it.Speaking on the Daily Show, Noah said: I hope there are two Donald Trumps   that way he can go f*ck himself Yep that just about does it.But Noah s whole rant delivered a brutal drop kick to the Trump campaign and its cynical use of every dirty tactic in the book to gain power   with near total disregard for the consequences. We laugh, but it s still more likely there s only one Donald Trump, who is just a cynical, manipulating man, manipulating his followers and his enemies and the media without any concern for what he s doing to the country, That s possible. That s probably the truth. But I do hope   I do hope   that there are two Donald Trumps. Because that way he could go f*ck himself. Turning to the ever-escalating racist violence spilling out of Trump rallies across the country, Noah didn t mince his words either. Here s the truth: Donald Trump didn t just create an atmosphere for violence at his rallies, he engineered it as carefully and deliberately as Matt Damon did when he was growing potatoes on Mars. Finally the host appealed to fans of Trump s opponents to avoid confronting Trump fans, or attempting to shut down their rallies, saying: If you come in, and you actually try to silence them, it s like trying to put a fire out by putting wood onto it, You ve given Trump the villain that, up until now, he was making up. The issue of course, with failing to confront Trump and his merry band of agitators, is that fascism is the genie you can t put back in the bottle.Donald Trump, and his fellow Republican candidates, have pulled the most noxious, toxic, racist, sexist behavior back into the mainstream.The Republican establishment knows they have opened pandora s box, a box that they cannot now close. They hoped to leverage its toxic contents by turning it into votes for their establishment candidate. Instead, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz have been given the chance to take over; two men who would have been unelectable in almost any ballot in modern times. Whatever hell these candidates and their followers reap upon the country, it will taint the Republican party forever.Featured image via screengrab",News,"March 15, 2016",2421
" Trump Decides To Gut United Nations Funding By 50 Percent, Embarrassing And Endangering America On The World Stage","Donald Trump has decided to go through with his threat to defund the United Nations in retaliation for making a decision he didn t like.America has been the foremost leader on the international stage ever since World War II. After the war, the United States led the way in creating a more united and cooperative world by founding the United Nations to serve as a peacekeeping and humanitarian organization.The United Nations headquarters in located in New York and America has veto power and a seat on the prestigious United Nations Security Council.But now Donald Trump is preparing to slash funding to the United Nations by 50 percent, a move that would be a major blow against international cooperation and our reputation around the globe.Not only will the United Nations be cut by $5 billion, Trump s plan also makes a 37 percent cut to the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development budgets.And it s all in an effort by Trump to increase the already bloated military budget.United Nations expert Richard Gowan warned that cutting the funding would cause chaos and could cause agencies and programs within the United Nations to implode as other countries struggle to fill the gaps. Cutting the U.S. contribution would leave a gaping hole that other big donors would struggle to fill,  Gowan said.  Multiply that across other humanitarian agencies, like the World Food Program, and you are basically talking about the breakdown of the international humanitarian system as we know it. Indeed, the budget cuts could be devastating to the United Nations and threaten to bury international cooperation as we know it.Republicans have even drafted a bill directing Trump to withdraw the United States from the organization entirely.That means the United States would also be withdrawing from the World Bank, the International Court of Justice, the World Health Organization, the International Monetary Fund, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and the International Atomic Energy Agency, among many others.And because the United States is cutting funding, the United Nations may look to China or Russia to replace the funding, which could pave the way for a new power structure as the United States withdraws support.It s not only a serious blow to humanitarian efforts and global peacekeeping efforts, it s a serious rejection of international diplomacy and cooperation.And it s all because Trump and Republicans did not like that the United Nations passed a resolution condemning the continued building of Israeli settlements on Palestinian territory even though such resolutions have passed before.Trump is literally defunding the United Nations because they didn t comply with his demands despite the fact that President Obama was still in office at the time.This is absolutely humiliating for the United States and it should horrify the American people that Trump is withdrawing our country from the international community. Our influence and respect throughout the world will wane because of this decision and it will be difficult to regain it.America is once again becoming an isolationist nation, and the last time we ignored the world around us over 100 million people were killed in two world wars. By ignoring the world again and the growing humanitarian crisis, we are paving the way for World War III. And make no mistake, such a war today will make the first two world wars look like minor skirmishes.Featured Image: Wikimedia",News,"March 14, 2017",3500
 Trump Jr. Throws Temper Tantrum While Comey Testifies That His Dad Obstructed Justice,"Donald Trump has been asked by Republicans to not tweet during former FBI Director James Comey s testimony to Congress, so that task has apparently been given to his demon spawn instead.In his opening statement released on Wednesday, Comey shed light on a dinner he had with Trump in which Trump demanded Comey s loyalty. I need loyalty, I expect loyalty,  Trump said in January according to Comey.Comey then gave details of a meeting he had with Trump in February after the firing of Mike Flynn for having discussions with Russian officials.The President then returned to the topic of Mike Flynn, saying,  He is a good guy and has been through a lot.  He repeated that Flynn hadn t done anything wrong on his calls with the Russians, but had misled the Vice President. He then said,  I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go. It certainly sounds like Trump is guilty of trying to obstruct justice and that he fired Comey in order to sabotage the Russia investigation.As Comey testified in the Senate on Thursday, Donald Trump Jr. went on a tirade over it.1/3 Flynn stuff is BS in context 2 guys talking about a guy they both know well.

 Ted Cruz Ends His Campaign By Elbowing His Wife In The Face (VIDEO),"In case you haven t heard, God s chosen candidate, Ted Cruz, either disproved God s existence or showed the world that the Big-Guy-in-the-Sky REALLY hates smarmy, bigoted douchebags. Yes, the embarrassment to America that was Ted Cruz s campaign is finally over. Fate swallowed his chances up like that throat booger he ate on national television during a debate. You can all rest assured knowing that the Republican Party s destruction is finally complete in that Donald Trump is considered the most qualified candidate for the office of President.What better way to end his presidential campaign than to elbow his wife in the face? You may be staring at your screen wondering,  Did he just say what I think he said?  Yes, by punching and elbowing his wife in the face. While it was almost assuredly as much an accident as abstinence-only advocate Bristol Palin s multiple out-of-wedlock pregnancies, it actually happened.Still don t believe me? Watch:As Cruz was hugging his father, while his bigoted, homophobic, and hateful supporters looked on, the now-former presidential candidate accidentally did what most of America wants to do to him: he accidentally popped Heidi in the jaw then followed up with an elbow to the face.His campaign, which was built on catering to the absolute worst people in society s hatred and stupidity (the ones Trump had not already snagged up anyway), was truly an embarrassment to our nation   almost as embarrassing as the fact that his own daughter hates him just as much as the rest of us.But what will Cruz do now? Will he commit himself to the Senate, where he can continue to attempt to install a theofascist regime in America and fight diligently to take away the rights of anyone he thinks God tells him to hate? Will he come to terms with the fact that he, as the candidate he himself has stated God  chose  to lead America into the Promised Land, probably isn t the super-Christian he thinks he is? Will he continue his alleged career as the Zodiac Killer?No matter what Cruz does, one thing is for certain: he s probably going to spend some time in the  dog house  rather than the White House.Featured image via screengrab",News,"May 3, 2016",2168

NUMEROUS PUBLIC Rapes Of Teenage Girls Reported At Swedish Music Festivals: “Rapes at Swedish festivals are not really news anymore”,"Last year, we reported about women who attended an  anti-racism  music festival in Sweden that were raped and molested by migrant men. This report is yet another shocking example of how the west is actually importing a real rape culture.According to police spokesman Stefan Dangardt, numerous  foreign men  sexually assaulted the women during Borl nge s  Peace and Love  festival, although three suspects who were arrested were later released because they claimed they were minors.It appears that nothing has changed since last year. Yesterday, Swedish police received several reports of rape after   music festivals at various locations on Friday evening.A 15-year-old girl was raped during a concert at the Br valla Festival in Norrk ping on Friday night.According to the police, the girl was held and raped by a man in the midst of the crowd in front of the concert goers, without anyone intervening.  It s terrible that one has to experience such a thing with a lot of people around, says police spokesman, Thomas Agnevik, to Aftonbladet.We have little information about the perpetrator and about what has happened, he said, while encouraging those present during the concert to contact the police if they saw anything suspicious.The girl was taken care of and underwent a medical examination.During the City Festival in V ster s, two rapes were reported, one of a 16 year old girl.  We have talked to her and obtained information, but we currently have no suspects, said spokesperson for the police in V stmanland, Thomas Gustafsson.A 26-year-old woman has also reported rape after the festival.  She has been sent to hospital and we have been unable to talk to her. Therefore, I do not have any more details, says Gustafsson.Rapes at Swedish festivals are not really news anymore. It is merely about announcements. We are actually there now.  Speisa",left-news,"Jul 1, 2017",1855

OBAMA FINALLY BUILDS BORDER WALL…But There’s One Problem…It’s ONLY For The Obama’s,"President Obama blasted Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump in April, 2016 for his plan to bar immigrants in the U.S. from sending money back home to force Mexico to pay for a new border wall. Oh, no. It s Trump,  a smiling Obama said when he was asked about the 2016 candidate s latest comments.Obama called plan another shortsighted idea from Trump that could spark concern among world leaders.  I am getting questions constantly from foreign leaders about some of the wackier suggestions that are being made,  Obama told reporters at the White House.Obama said Trump s border wall proposal could have  enormous  economic consequences for Mexico, which receives billions of dollars in payments that immigrants in the U.S. send home, and possibly touch off a major spat with an ally. The notion that we are going to track every Western Union bit of money that s being sent to Mexico   good luck with that,  Obama said.Obama s remarks came after The Washington Post published a two-page memo from Trump outlining how he would get Mexico to pay for his wall. Trump s memo outlines how he would cut off certain remittances   cash transfers from people in the United States to Mexico   unless Mexico s government offered $5 billion to $10 billion to pay for the wall.Mexican President Enrique Pe a Nieto has said he won t pay for Trump s wall and claimed the candidate has damaged U.S.-Mexico relations.The country s former president, Vicente Fox, slammed the proposal, saying,  I m not going to pay for that f ing wall. Meanwhile, TMZ reported that workers are busy building a large wall around Obama s new DC residence where he will be moving from the White House, that was coincidentally, also surrounded by a massive wall.Why is it that politicians like Obama and even Republican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, who has a two-decade-long history of promoting open borders immigration policies, have no problem building a border fence for themselves and their family, even as they denies the American people those same protections.They re quick to criticize Trump and his supporters for wanting to build a wall on our southern border to keep foreign intruders and criminals out for the sake of our national security, yet have no problem erecting large walls around their personal residences to keep their own families safe ",left-news,"Jan 7, 2017",2337
Mueller Team Uniform? ‘Democratic Donkey Jerseys’ and ‘I’m With Hillary T-Shirts’ says Congressman,"Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appeared before the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, amid new questions about Anti-Trump text messages sent by FBI employees assigned to special counsel Robert Mueller s Russia investigation. Rosenstein testified that Mueller is running his office  appropriately  and without bias.In a colorful exchange between Congressman Steve Chabot (R-OH) and Rosenstein, Chabot asked the Deputy AG: How with a straight face, can you say that this group of Democrat partisans are unbiased, and will give President Trump a fair shake? After a brief stammer, Rosenstein replied that political affiliation and the issue of bias are different things, and that we should trust the experience Mueller and the Justice Department have in managing investigation teams, adding: We recognize that we have employees with political opinions, and it s our responsibility to make sure those opinions do not influence their actions. To which Chabot argued how can anyone possibly reach that conclusion: I was at first encouraged. It seemed like a serious matter and deserved a serious investigation. And I assumed, as many of us did, that Mr. Mueller would pull together an unbiased team. But, rather than wearing stripes as umpires and referees might wear, I would submit that the Mueller team overwhelmingly, uh, oughta be attired with Democratic donkeys on their jerseys or  I m with Hillary  t-shirts, certainly not with  Let s Make America Great Again and I think that s a shame.

 President Obama Will Sing On Coldplay’s Next Album (VIDEO),"Normally, the thought of listening to Coldplay is the stuff of nightmares, just behind spooning with Sarah Palin and spending more than 20 seconds staring at Ted Cruz s face. But something is happening that, for a few seconds, might just make what would normally be an act of self-torture tolerable: Coldplay has announced that the President s moving rendition of  Amazing Grace  will be included on their next album.The band s frontman, Chris Martin, says the singing voice of President Barack Obama will make an appearance on upcoming album,  A Head Full of Dreams,  which is due to be released next month. He told British tabloid The Sun: We have a tiny clip of the president singing  Amazing Grace.  Because of the historical significance of what he did and also that that song being about,  I m lost but now I m found . The publication notes that the band has obtained both Obama s personal permission to use his voice, and that of the church in which the golden words were recorded.A source close to the band added:  Barack Obama wouldn t let just anyone feature his vocals on the record, especially considering what a deeply emotional moment it was for him. But he clearly loves Coldplay and is happy to be a part of their music history. The band were obviously thrilled. They needed to get permission from Obama himself and the Charleston church it was recorded in. I met Barack Obama in the summer and one thing he said to me was,  Oh I have your songs on my iPod,  but I just thought,  Oh I bet he says that to every pop star he meets,  Martin says. I can t get my head around the notion that the President of the USA would have any of my songs on his playlist. It is just too surreal. While many would question the President s choice in music, none can deny that it would truly be an honor for any band to obtain the President s personal permission to use his voice in their songs.Watch the President show off his dulcet tones below:Featured image via Getty",News,"April 14, 2016",1968
GERMANY: Afghan “Teen” Refugee Who RAPED and KILLED Female Med Student and Refugee Volunteer Is Actually 33-Years Old…And There’s MORE!,"On September 5, 2017, the Daily Mail reported:Afghan asylum seeker accused of raping and murdering EU official s teenage daughter  attacked her to satisfy his sexual urges before leaving her unconscious in a river to drown Hussein Khavari, 22, who claims to be from Afghanistan has been accused of ambushing Maria Ladenburger, 19, as she cycled home after a party, raping her and then drowning her in Freiburg, Germany last October.He was linked through his DNA to medical student Maria, who volunteered at various shelters that house migrants in her spare time in Freiburg.Hussein claimed to be Afghani but the court heard that there is evidence he is Iraqi. And his claim to be 17 at the time of the offense was disputed by a specialist saying he was at least 22. According to Bild newspaper, during a morning session of hearings in which press and public were excluded, he claimed to be 19.He said he claimed to be 16 upon his arrival in Germany in 2015  because the situation is better here for underage migrants.  The court must decide if he is to be tried as a juvenile or an adult.A murder conviction as a juvenile would mean a maximum ten-year jail term, as an adult a possible life sentence.As it turns out, the fake  teenager  who admitted to raping and murdering the actual teenager, is pretty far removed from his teenage years. According to the Voice of Europe,  the Afghan refugee, who is now on trial for the rape and murder of the medical student Maria Ladenburger in October 2016, is older than previously thought.Hussein Khavari entered Germany in November 2015 without identity papers. He told authorities that he was born in 1999 in Afghanistan and that his father was killed during the war.But it now appears that his father is still alive. According to German media source, Bil.de, his father said his son was born in 1984 and that he is 33-years-old.The Local Germany says about it:  Prosecutors were able to track down Hussein K. s father when they came across a contact on his mobile phone. The defendant told them that they could contact his mother on the number. But when an interpreter called the number in the presence of two judges, the person who picked up was his father .Maria Ladenburger s father is a senior legal adviser to the European Commission in Brussels. Maria herself was volunteering as a refugee worker in various shelters and asylum homes. ",politics,"Dec 9, 2017",2386
HAS EUROPE GONE MAD? CONVICTED Terrorist Recruiters Free To Roam Streets If They “Behave” Themselves During Trial,"In their rush to make radical Muslims terrorists feel as though they are welcome in Belgium, coupled with their naive belief that if they coddle them enough, they will assimilate, the authorities have clearly forgotten about the victims of a horrific terror attack that took place in Brussels only months ago. When european nations start coddling terrorists and terror recruiters who are attracting Muslims from their homeland to commit horrific acts of violence against innocent people, the entire nation is screwed Erin McLaughlin of CNN told the story of a young man, a teen who became caught up in the ISIS recruiting web after a vacation in Belgium. Eight months after that trip to vacation in Belgium, Salia said her son became radicalized. He sent her a Facebook message to let her know he was in Syria.Then came a chilling phone call. the Syrian guide said,  Congratulation, congratulation. Your son died as a martyr,  and then he hung up.It was horrible. when I heard about his death, I felt like I died myself. she says her son was the happiest of her four children. She didn t know the most dangerous jihadist recruitment network in Brussels approached her son.It was the most dangerous of webs. Some were convicted and given lengthy prison sentences but, remarkably, were free on bail.It is veteran jihadists and recruiters. Some would go on to carry out the terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels. Authorities prosecuted for man 60 recruiters and foreign fighters. One of them was Sala. His recruiters were declared guilty as you see here, the judge allowed them to walk free pending their appeal. CNN tracked down one of the recruiters to his home address that is neighborhood of a convicted recruiter.Her son said he pleaded, he wanted to come home. The recruiter said,  no . We re here to ask him why.We ring the doorbell. His mother answers. She screams at us to leave her alone. As we walk away, the recruiter appears and confronts us. His words are not welcoming. He refuses to talk to us on camera.Families living in the complex don t even know they are living amongst them. It must be the EU PC.Belgian authorities tell CNN they have NOT notified residents that a convicted jihadist recruiter is living in their midst.We saw a teenage boy entering the same apartment building. the president of Brussels tribunal says in Belgium it is not unusual for a criminal to go free while they re waiting for appeal. If they re not considered a flight risk. How s it that a convicted member of a terrorist organization sentenced to seven years in prison is allowed to walk free after his trial? They re free, the official said, because they behaved during the trial.His mother said it s like her son died twice seeing his recruiters running loose on the streets.For entire story: Independent Sentinel",left-news,"May 14, 2016",2811
LOL! POLITICO Publishes Article Blaming TRUMP And His Supporters For Horrific Violence Committed Against Them,"This ridiculous article by Politico, who pretends to be a non-biased source for news is sadly, what passes as journalism today. We ve taken the liberty of highlighting the article in places where POLTICO has gone out of their way to blame Trump and/or his supporters for the violent protesters (many of whom are paid by leftist organizations). Our comments can be found in parenthesis following the highlighted copy.Outside Donald Trump s campaign rallies in recent days, protesters have gathered and, increasingly, clashed violently with Trump supporters and police. Inside, Trump is going to new rhetorical extremes in his attempts to delegitimize a Mexican-American judge. Together, (Together? Does anyone else find it to be slightly ridiculous that the person writing this piece would honestly think anyone believes Trump and the violent anti-Trump protesters were working together?) they re forming an increasingly combustible atmosphere as the campaign enters the summer and temperatures here climb into triple digits.Trump has in the past vowed to become more  presidential  after dispatching his primary foes, and many political observers hoped tensions would decrease as Trump pivoted to appeal to broader swath of voters in the general election.Instead, the end of the primary has seen a steady rise in tension, fueling fears that the convention in Cleveland next month will surpass the turbulence of the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago.Tense standoffs involving police, protesters and Trump supporters are common sights at campaign rallies, and violence has occasionally flared up, but there has been an uptick in the scale and frequency of violence over the past two weeks during the candidate s swing through the West. Most of the violence has been directed at police officers and Trump supporters outside rally venues, but on Friday, one local leader who condemned the violence also partly blamed Trump for it. (Of course, it s Trump s fault that the Left is paying people to riot and to attack innocent people along with the law enforcement officers who are hired to keep the peace.) While it s a sad statement about our political discourse that Mr. Trump has focused on stirring antagonism (Trump s fault) instead of offering real solutions to our nation s challenges, there is absolutely no place for violence against people who are simply exercising their rights to participate in the political process,  said San Jose Mayor Sam Riccardo, a Democrat, in a statement on Friday. In another statement, Riccardo said Trump s rhetoric is no excuse for violence and that city police would investigate and prosecute offenders. She said no protesters had applied for permits to demonstrate. In Albuquerque, where demonstrators shattered windows at the site of Trump s rally on Tuesday, police made three arrests and have an outstanding felony warrant for another demonstrator that includes eight counts of aggravated battery on a police officer, according to Albuquerque Police public information officer Tanner Tixier. He added that police were working four to five other cases that could lead to more arrests.Tidier also shot down as  conspiracy theories  rumors that anti-Trump demonstrators were illegal immigrants or paid agitators. (Because this public information officer knows each and every protester, and whether they ve been paid or are legal citizens of the United States.) They re just general local criminals. I don t even think they knew what they were protesting,  he said.The Mexican flag has been a common sight at recent protests in the West, which is home to many Mexicans and Mexican-Americans. Trump, meanwhile, began insisting during the past week that the judge presiding over one of the lawsuits against Trump University, Gonzalo Curiel, could not be fair because of his Mexican heritage. The statement   condemned by House Speaker Paul Ryan, editorial boards and legal watchdogs   can only inflame tensions out here. Muriel, the son of Mexican immigrants, was born in Indiana. (Because if Paul Ryan condemned Trump, the whole Republican party must be against him right?)Despite the warning signs, there is little indication from the Trump campaign or anti-Trump demonstrators that they plan to change course, making continued unrest likely in the months ahead. (In other words, there is no indication Trump plans to change his policies in order to appease illegal aliens and leftist thugs.)Entire article can be found at Politico",politics,"Jun 4, 2016",4471
FEEL GOOD STORY OF THE DAY: Globalist Billionaire George Soros Melt Down…Calls Trump “Con Artist”…Says He Threatens “Open Society Model”," Says the guy who s been funding riots across America and dumping hundreds of millions into radical organizations meant to destroy America and our way of life.Soros, the Hungarian-born magnate who supported Hillary Clinton s candidacy as well as other liberal causes worldwide, says that the rise of Trump and his affinity for rulers like Russian President Vladimir Putin threaten the open society model championed by the European Union.  Democracy is now in crisis,  Soros writes in Project Syndicate.  Even the US, the world s leading democracy, elected a con artist and would-be dictator as its president. Although Trump has toned down his rhetoric since he was elected, he has changed neither his behavior nor his advisers. The US will be preoccupied with internal struggles in the near future, and targeted minorities will suffer,  according to Soros.  The US will be unable to protect and promote democracy in the rest of the world. On the contrary, Trump will have greater affinity with dictators. That will allow some of them to reach an accommodation with the US, and others to carry on without interference.   Trump will prefer making deals to defending principles. Unfortunately, that will be popular with his core constituency,  he writes.Soros writes that Putin helped Trump win the election by utilizing social media to disseminate fake news stories.He said that the Russian leader is now using the same tactic to undermine democratic governments throughout the EU.Since Trump s election win, Soros has contributed money to an international fact-checking organization that will warn readers on social media of stories whose veracity is deemed questionable.Click HERE for the list of 187 radical organizations funded by George Soros.Soros  organization, Open Society Foundation, is listed among organizations which are backing The International Fact Checking Network, the body tasked with flagging bogus news stories to social media users, on its website.Soros, a staunch Democrat who tried to block George W. Bush s campaign in 2004, has given $25million to Clinton and causes dear to her.Soros writes that he fears for the future of the free world, as populist movement threaten to upend the status quo.

HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER SEEKS HELP FROM UNION AFTER BEING FIRED FOR STOMPING ON AMERICAN FLAG IN CLASS [Video],"This is just another example of the rampant indoctrination of our children by the anti-American left God bless these local veterans who came forward in defense of our American flag:A teacher who allegedly stomped on the American flag during a high school lesson on free speech has been fired.The Martinsville School District board has unanimously voted 6-0 to fire English teacher Jordan Parmenter, WGLT reports.The teacher incensed students after he stepped on the flag during a May lesson on free speech at Martinsville Junior-Senior High School.According to a student in the class, Parmenter was using a small American flag as a pointer for a chart and when the student said it was  disrespectful,  the teacher  said he then made what he says was the rash decision of dropping the flag to the floor and stepping on it to illustrate an example of free speech as part of the lesson that day,  according to the Journal Gazette. We can t figure out why he actually went to the simulations of actually doing it,  Jonathon Smith, a senior at the school, was quoted as saying by TristateHomePage.com last month. He talked about it being the right to do whatever he wants. That s why it was there so he could do whatever he wants, but we have no idea why he would actually take it down and basically start all this. Several residents reportedly protested outside the school after the incident to bring attention to it, walking a flag back and forth in front of the building. It s just disgraceful,  protester Clifford Clouser, a U.S. Navy veteran, told WTHI-TV while fighting back tears.  There s just so much history in that flag   some good, some bad   but it s still our flag. Protester Nicholas Gibson, a veteran of the U.S. Marines, told the TV station,  It should have never happened. I m very proud of these kids that have stood up for what they believe in. Parmenter wrote a letter of apology to the school board, but it wasn t enough to save his job.The teacher wouldn t speak to the media following his termination, except to say he plans to speak with his union representative, according to Fox 2.Via: EAG News",left-news,"Jun 30, 2015",2116
SAY “HELLO” TO YOUR NEW NEIGHBORS! Clooney Begged For Open Borders…Now Massive Refugee Camp Is Erected In His Front Yard,"Karma it s a beautiful thing A massive makeshift refugee camp has been established in Lake Como, the popular and secluded celebrity hideaway in Italy where Hollywood A-lister George Clooney keeps a home.The migration of hundreds of people from Arab nations, Africa, and Asia was triggered following the Swiss government s decision to close its southern border with Italy.Now, waiting for smugglers to lead them into northern Europe, groups of migrants are camping out in tattered tents around the Lake Como resort.https://twitter.com/ScatterBrainPOD/status/753134667490930688Flimsy dwellings, clothes and trash are scattered around the Northern Italian town s railway station, where dozens of new families and refugees have flocked.https://twitter.com/PatriceArnold25/status/753183423573794825The migrant camp is, oddly enough, just steps away from the front door of immigration activists  George and Amal Clooney s multi-million dollar lakeside mansion in Lake Como, according to the Daily Mail.The power couple has spent some time talking about the migrant crisis. The Clooneys met privately with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in February and praised and thanked her for her leadership during the crisis.The Clooneys have taken refuge from the Hollywood spotlight in their summer home in Italy for years. Last year, Page Six reported that Clooney was mulling putting his Lake Como villa on the market due to ever-present and intrusive paparazzi.It is unclear if the recent deluge of refugees pouring into town will have an affect on Clooney s decision to sell or not.

How does a man protect himself from such charges?If this could be brought up on charges, then every high profile man out there needs a witness when he walks around anywhere.Are the comments (if true) that this woman said Bill O Reilly made considered sexual harassment to you? What exactly is sexual harassment? If it s how you feel then men are in big trouble because of all of the  offended  women out there. Should the definition be broader or should it be more narrowly defined. We feel with our litigious society, the cases for sexual harassment should be very closely scrutinized.

Global Warming Scammer Makes Millions BUT Is Jail Time In His Future?,"Global warming has been shoved down the throats of every American since the day Obama took office. The only problem is that it s a massive hoax that is being used to transfer money from taxpayers to be redistributed amongst the liberal elite and those who the elites deem worthy. One of those liberal elites is being called on the carpet by a Texas congressman:Jagadish Shukla, the climate commie who has been making a fortune off the global warming hoax and who demands that skeptics be imprisoned is FINALLY in some hot water.Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX), Chairman of the House Committee on Space, Science and Technology, has written to Professor Jagadish Shukla of George Mason University, in Virginia, requesting that he release all relevant documents pertaining to his activities as head of a non-profit organization called the Institute of Global Environment And Society.Smith has two main areas of concern:First, the apparent engagement by the institute in  partisan political activity    which, as a non-profit, it is forbidden by law from doing.Second, what precisely has the IGES institute done with the $63 million in taxpayer grants which it has received since 2001 and which appears to have resulted in remarkably little published research?For example, as Watts Up With That? notes, a $4.2 million grant from the National Science Foundation to one of the institute s offshoots appears to have resulted in just one published paper.But the amount which has gone into the pockets of Shukla and his cronies runs into the many hundreds of thousands of dollars. In 2013 and 2014, for example, Shukla and his wife enjoyed a combined income in excess of $800,000 a year.There s more:[F]or nearly 14 years, he, his family and his friends have been gorging themselves on taxpayers  money at IGES; and   this money comes on top of the very generous salary he receives for doing much the same work at George Mason University (GMU).It s the latter detail which has led former Virginia State Climatologist Pat Michaels   one of the skeptics who might have been affected by Shukla s proposed RICO prosecutions   to describe this as  the largest science scandal in US history. Under federal law, state employees may not be remunerated for doing work which falls under their state employee remit. As a Professor at GMU, Shukla is definitely an employee of the state. And the work for which he has most lavishly been rewarding himself at IGES appears to be remarkably similar to the work he does at GMU as professor of climate dynamics.Getting paid twice to tell the same pernicious lies is a fine deal for Shuknjivela, but it hasn t been working out so well for taxpayers.Read more:  moonbattery",Government News,"Oct 5, 2015",2686

UPDATE: CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY THAT STATUE REMOVED AFTER LIBS COMPLAIN OF “WHITE SUPREMACY” AND “RACISM” Replaces With Ferguson Protestors [VIDEO],"This is a perfect example of the effort by liberals to erase our American history. Like it or not, we have a history and we should never try and erase the good OR the bad. The priest is praying over the Indians who re wearing just what Indians wore back then. Why is this racist? Why is this anything but a moment in time captured in a statue?  Saint Louis University has removed a statue on its campus depicting a famous Jesuit missionary priest praying over American Indians after a cohort of students and faculty continued to complain the sculpture symbolized white supremacy, racism and colonialism.Formerly placed outside the university s Fusz Hall in the center of the private Catholic university, the statue will go to the university s art museum, a building just north of the bustling urban campus.The statue features famous Jesuit Missionary Pierre-Jean De Smet S.J. praying over two American Indians dressed in traditional clothing. Last Monday, just two days after graduation, it was removed from the location it has called home on campus for decades.A university spokesperson told St. Louis Magazine the statue will be placed within the  historical context of a collection that s on permanent display in our SLU Museum of Art.  The statue is set for the museum s  Collection of the Western Jesuit Missions. In more recent years, there have been some faculty and staff who have raised questions about whether the sculpture is culturally sensitive,  SLU spokesman Clayton Berry said.Berry did not respond to The College Fix s request for comment.The De Smet statue has long drawn the ire of progressive students and scholars at the Jesuit university who argue the statue was a symbol of racism and white supremacy, among other oppressions.In a recent op-ed published in SLU s University News, senior Ryan McKinley stated the sculpture sent a clear, unwelcoming message to American Indians at Saint Louis University.Via: College Fix ",politics,"May 27, 2015",1942

New Book Reveals HILLARY’S ANTI-SEMITIC SIDE: Blamed Bill’s Campaign Manager For Losing Congressional Race…Called Him A “F*cking Jew B*stard”,"Hillary doesn t recall saying it, but Bill s campaign manager, Paul Fray clearly remembers her saying it. Just another Hillary lie what different does it make? Hillary Clinton is fighting a rearguard action to avoid further damage to her standing with the crucial Jewish vote in her campaign for a Senate seat after a claim that she once used an ethnic insult against one of Bill Clinton s aides.A book out today claims that 26 years ago she called Paul Fray, her husband s campaign manager at the time, a  fucking Jew bastard .Mrs Clinton denied the allegation and pressed the president into supporting her, but the author, Jerry Oppenheimer, said:  Three witnesses have now publicly acknowledged that she said it. I have never said anything like that, ever,  Mrs Clinton said.  I have in the past certainly, you know maybe, called somebody a name. But I have never used an ethnic, racial, anti-Semitic, bigoted, discriminatory, prejudiced, accusation against anybody. I ve never done it. I ve never thought it. Mr Clinton, who was trying to bring about a Middle East peace deal at Camp David, backed her up.  I was there on election night in 1974 and the charge is simply not true,  he said. She might have called him a bastard, I wouldn t rule that out. She s never claimed that she was pure on profanity. But I ve never heard her tell a joke with an ethnic connotation. She s so fanatic about it. It s not in her. Referring to a  vast rightwing conspiracy  in previous elections, he said:  This is part of a pattern. They couldn t defeat me politically and they can t defeat her politically so they go after us personally. Accounts of the dispute on election night 1974, when Mr Clinton failed to win a congressional seat representing Arkansas, have appeared before without the ethnic insult.Those present at the inquest into the defeat were Mr Clinton, his then-girlfriend Hillary, his campaign manager Paul Fray, and Mr Fray s wife, Mary Lee. Neill McDonald, a campaign worker, was just outside the room and claims to have heard everything.The Frays and Mr McDonald are the three witnesses on whom Mr Oppenheimer, a former reporter on the National Inquirer tabloid, relies for the passage in his book State of a Union: Inside the Complex Marriage of Bill and Hillary Clinton.Mr Fray, 57, said yesterday:  I was a little defensive about it. I looked to the floor thinking  How do I respond?  I didn t mind being called a son-of-a-bitch, but when it came to attacking my culture, that s a whole  nother ballgame. You ve got to understand it was the heat of the moment. We knew we had lost. It was a case of people lashing out at one another and it just got to that point. Mr Fray is actually a Southern Baptist but says that he is one-eighth Jewish through his great-grandfather.Mrs Fray said that her husband s recollection of the meeting, which lasted about an hour, was accurate. Mr McDonald said:  I don t know what provoked it or what. I just remember that one little comment.  Via: The Guardian ",left-news,"Jun 11, 2016",3005
WHOA! 2006: HILLARY CLINTON CAUGHT Expressing Regret About Not Rigging Palestinian Elections,"Crooked Hillary has always been crooked. She s just been better than anyone America s ever seen at not getting caught On September 5, 2006, Eli Chomsky was an editor and staff writer for the Jewish Press, and Hillary Clinton was running for a shoo-in re-election as a U.S. senator. Her trip making the rounds of editorial boards brought her to Brooklyn to meet the editorial board of the Jewish Press.The tape was never released and has only been heard by the small handful of Jewish Press staffers in the room. According to Chomsky, his old-school audiocassette is the only existent copy and no one has heard it since 2006, until today when he played it for the Observer.The tape is 45 minutes and contains much that is no longer relevant, such as analysis of the re-election battle that Sen. Joe Lieberman was then facing in Connecticut. But a seemingly throwaway remark about elections in areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority has taken on new relevance amid persistent accusations in the presidential campaign by Clinton s Republican opponent Donald Trump that the current election is  rigged. Speaking to the Jewish Press about the January 25, 2006, election for the second Palestinian Legislative Council (the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority), Clinton weighed in about the result, which was a resounding victory for Hamas (74 seats) over the U.S.-preferred Fatah (45 seats). I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake,  said Sen. Clinton.  And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win. Chomsky recalls being taken aback that  anyone could support the idea offered by a national political leader, no less that the U.S. should be in the business of fixing foreign elections. Some eyebrows were also raised when then-Senator Clinton appeared to make a questionable moral equivalency.For entire story: Observer",left-news,"Oct 28, 2016",1998
 McConnell SUPPRESSED Info That Russia Worked To Elect Trump – Threatened Obama If He Released It,"As news that the CIA had solid evidence that Russia did indeed meddle in our election, possibly to the point of influencing the results, it also came out that our Senate Majority Leader was actively working to prevent that information from coming out. He basically said that he d accuse the White House of playing partisan politics if they went public and challenged Russia.Our intelligence community actually identified individual people, with connections to the Russian government, who gave Wikileaks thousands of emails hacked from both the DNC and John Podesta, Hillary s campaign chairman. They re part of a bigger Russian plot to harm Hillary, and get Trump elected, according to the intelligence community: Intelligence agencies have identified individuals with connections to the Russian government who provided WikiLeaks with thousands of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and others, including Hillary Clinton s campaign chairman, according to U.S. officials. Those officials described the individuals as actors known to the intelligence community and part of a wider Russian operation to boost Trump and hurt Clinton s chances. Sounds conspiracy-theorish, doesn t it? This kind of thing is the stuff that the right-wing conspiracy theorists spin out of nothing. The only difference is that our intelligence officials actually know this is happening, rather than the conspiracy theorists making up their own info in the face of official truth.There is a legitimate concern about making the strain on our relationship with Russia worse than it is. However, that s not what McConnell seemed worried about back in September when this information first began coming to light. At the time, the White House had been looking for broad, bipartisan support from Congressional leaders in coming out with the information. They were worried about looking like they were, in fact, playing politics.McConnell, however, decided to threaten the White House with that accusation regardless: The Democratic leaders in the room unanimously agreed on the need to take the threat seriously. Republicans, however, were divided, with at least two GOP lawmakers reluctant to accede to the White House requests.According to several officials, McConnell raised doubts about the underlying intelligence and made clear to the administration that he would consider any effort by the White House to challenge the Russians publicly an act of partisan politics. He did not want this information getting out, although why is anybody s guess. We know that the RNC was hacked as well, but whatever those hacks discovered was never released: We now have high confidence that they hacked the D.N.C. and the R.N.C., and conspicuously released no documents  from the Republican organization, one senior administration official said, referring to the Russians. Why? It raises all sorts of questions, including whether McConnell had an idea about that and was afraid of the GOP looking like they were actively working with Russia to secure a Trump presidency. With this information, McConnell looks almost like a Russian pawn, whether he actually is or not.Featured image by Win McNamee via Getty Images",News,"December 10, 2016",3191
 WATCH: Van Jones Epically SCOLDS Trump Supporters For Defending ‘Rigged Election’ Debate Talk,"When Donald Trump s CNN stooges tried to defend his remarks about whether he would accept the results of the election or not, Van Jones scolded them into humiliation.Donald Trump s debate performance once again suffered because of his big mouth and his refusal to stop claiming that the election is  rigged  against him.When asked by moderator Chris Wallace on Wednesday night if he will concede defeat if the election results favor Hillary Clinton, Trump stunned everyone by basically leaving the question into an Election Day cliffhanger. I will look at it at the time,  Trump said.  I will keep you in suspense. Trump s refusal to accept the democratic process is dangerous and is totally unprecedented in the history of our country. Whoever loses the election has always conceded defeat and acknowledged the winner as the president-elect.But Trump may do the opposite and refuse to accept the results, which could touch off a Constitutional crisis as well as riots and acts of violence by Trump supporters in protest of their candidate s defeat.Trump supporters Jeffrey Lord and Kayleigh McEnany, however, actually tried defending Trump s toddler-like behavior during CNN s post-debate discussion. And Van Jones was having none of it.He ripped both of Trump s mouthpieces to shreds and shamed them for defending a man who is unpatriotic and a disgrace to American Democracy. This is a really sad night,  Jones said.  This is a very sad night for the country. You can t polish this turd. I m going to be very, very clear about this. Al Gore respected the Constitution, respected the process, respected every voter. He went to our Supreme Court, asked for a resolution on his own terms as did George W. Bush. And when the election results were certified, he told his party and base to stand down and accept this, even though a lot of us were very, very upset. What you just got now was the nominee of a major party for the first time in our history signaling to the American people that he has so little faith in our institutions, that he has so little faith in our people, and so little faith in our courts, and so little faith in the Republican governors, the Republican secretaries of state across this country that he will not stand in front of his own country, in front of his own nation and say that he respects the process and the outcome. Indeed, despite a close race in 2000 that could have gone Gore s way had the Supreme Court allowed the recount to continue, the former vice-president accepting the Court s decision and conceded the race, something Trump may actually refuse to do on November 8th even if he loses by a landslide.Trump s refusal to say that he will accept the results of the election if he loses angered Jones tremendously, enough that he called Trump  unpatriotic  and told Lord and McEnany that they should be ashamed of themselves for defending him. That is an outrage! The appalling lack of patriotism from this man. The appalling lack of patriotism of this man to say this and praise Putin and Assad more than he has ever praised any American president. He doesn t talk about George Washington, He doesn t talk about Ronald Reagan the way he talks about Putin and Assad. This man has demonstrated an appalling lack of patriotism and you should be ashamed to defend it. Here s the video via VidMe.At this point, anyone who has defended Trump should be ashamed of themselves, and frankly, none of them should be able to get a job after this election is over. The things Donald Trump has said over the course of this campaign are indefensible and embarrassing. As Americans, Lord and McEnany should be embarrassed by their candidate s temper tantrums and outrageous claims. But they are not, and that s why Van Jones took it upon himself to put them in their place.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"October 20, 2016",3823
HOLY CASH COW! Check Out How Much Wall Street Funneled Into HILLARY’s Foundation/Slush Fund,"Thank God she has a vagina, otherwise her blatant hypocrisy might be an issue with voters Hillary Clinton is facing more questions about her close ties to Wall Street financial institutions. Last week, the New York Times urged Clinton to release transcripts of her highly-compensated speeches to Wall Street firm Goldman Sachs.The paid speeches are just a slim chapter of her relationship with financial titans. According to Clinton Foundation records, Wall Street financial institutions have donated around $40 million to the eponymous family foundation.As a non-profit, the Clinton Foundation isn t legally required to disclose its donors or contributions. The Foundation has publicly disclosed some contributions on its website. It only provides ranges for contributions, e.g. $1-5 million, and doesn t detail when the contribution was made or for what purpose, if any.Here s the chart of contributions from Wall Street to the Clinton Foundation.All together, contributions from readily identifiable Wall Street institutions to the Foundation total somewhere between $11 million and $41 million in contributions. If we assume the donations fall in the middle of the ranges disclosed by the Clinton Foundation, the contributions would total just under $30 million.As with most things involving the Clintons, the devil is in the details. This total of contributions does not include those made by individuals with strong Wall Street ties. It also does not necessarily represent the total amounts contributed to the Foundation from those donors listed. It only accounts for the donations which the Foundation has chosen to disclose.The failure of the Foundation to include any information on the timing of the donations is especially worrisome. In terms of donor relationships, there is a real difference between a one-time gift of $1 million and an ongoing gift of $200,000 for 5 straight years. The total dollar amount may be the same, but an ongoing gift usually requires a more substantive relationship between the Foundation and the donor.There is, of course, an added dimension to the timing issue with the Clintons. During the life of the Foundation, Hillary Clinton has been a US Senator, Secretary of State and two-time candidate for President.When the Clinton Foundation discloses that the  Friends of Saudi Arabia  contributed $1-5 million, it begs the obvious question of when that donation was made. The specific date of that donation is particularly important, given Clinton s considerable focus on the Middle East while she was Secretary of State.It is also important to note that these contributions are completely seperate from the paid speeches made by Bill and Hillary Clinton. In 2013 alone, Hillary earned just over $3 million in paid speeches to financial firms and institutions.These contributions, obviously, also don t include direct contributions made by Wall Street institutions and individuals to either of Clinton s Presidential campaigns.For entire story: Breitbart News",politics,"Mar 1, 2016",3000
 WATCH: Anderson Cooper Wipes The Floor With Trump’s Lies About Coverage Of Terrorist Attacks,"Donald Trump accused the media of covering up terrorist attacks and promptly got his ass handed to him by Anderson Cooper on CNN.On Monday during remarks to U.S. Central Command, Trump claimed that terrorist attacks are happening all over Europe all the time but the media is allegedly not reporting on them just to keep Americans in the dark. All over Europe it s happening,  Trump said.  It s gotten to a point where it s not even being reported. And in many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn t want to report it. They have their reasons and you understand that. However, when Trump released a list of terrorist attacks that the media has supposedly ignored, news agencies everywhere laughed.The list of 78 attacks includes those that occurred in San Bernardino, Paris, Orlando, and Nice, just to name a few. The problem is that the media covered these attacks thoroughly on a daily basis for quite some time. And there is video tape to prove it.During his show on Monday night, Cooper played a montage of himself covering many of these attacks and he blasted Trump for lying. Not only did we cover many of the attacks on that list, we covered them heavily. I know, because I was on the ground reporting a number of them. CNN was on the ground in Ottawa, Canada, when a gunman killed someone at the tomb of the unknown soldier. I was in Orlando, I flew there right after the news broke. December 2015, that was on the list, San Bernardino. I was there, 14 people killed and 21 wounded in coordinated attacks. This was just a month after I reported on the carnage in Paris, where terrorists killed 130 people and wounded many others. To be sure, this program did not cover each and every incident on the list, however other programs, as well as CNN International, covered most if not all of them, most of them exhaustively. Here s the video via YouTube.Donald Trump has told lie after lie after lie since taking over the White House and his attacks against the media are childish. There is literally thousands of hours of video of news reporters and anchors covering all of the attacks Trump put on the list. At this point, the media really should take action against Trump. His attacks constitute slander and the media definitely has a strong case.Trump is trying to hype up terrorist attacks in order to scare Americans into supporting his unconstitutional Muslim ban. And he is trying to make it sound like the media is helping the terrorists. If anyone is helping terrorists it s Donald Trump. His Muslim ban is literally being used as propaganda by terrorist organizations as a recruiting tool. He should be ashamed of himself, and if and when a terrorist attack does occur against this country, Trump will be to blame.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"February 7, 2017",2761
 The FBI Just Received A Voter Suppression Complaint That Will TERRIFY Trump,"The FBI has actually received a voter suppression complaint, but not against Hillary and the Democrats despite Trump s insistence that she s rigging the entire election. No this complaint was filed against Trump himself, and targets his dangerous requests that his followers monitor polling places on Election Day.The complaint comes from the Democratic Coalition Against Trump, and a memo on the complaint specifically states: Over the weekend, the Democratic Coalition Against Trump filed complaints against Donald Trump with the United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division and with the FBI Public Corruption Unit for violations of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which guarantees the right to vote for all citizens. The complaints were filed as a reaction to Donald Trump s call for his supporters to go out and  watch the polls,  which will prevent citizens from exercising their right to vote. Trump has repeatedly called for his followers to act as poll watchers to ensure that no in-person voter fraud happens (which is almost non-existent). One man even said that he was planning on engaging in racial profiling for the purpose of intimidating anyone who didn t  look  American (read: anyone who appeared to be Mexican or Syrian). His hope seems to be to weed out people who aren t allowed to vote by making them nervous.Scott Dworkin, who wrote the memo, went on to copy the words of the DCAT s complaint, which not only went to the FBI, but also went to the Department of Justice: This complaint is against Donald Trump and his campaign for voter intimidation and suppression nationally.  Trump has encouraged his supporters to  go over and watch  polling places, the implication being to instill fear specifically to minority communities in the inner cities.By encouraging his supporters to go out and watch polling places, Donald Trump is violating the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Dworkin details out how violence at Trump s rallies could be enough to frighten minority voters away from polling places if they know the same violent, racist bigots will be lurking. Nobody wants to try and cast a vote with someone who hates them standing over their shoulders.Dworkin also cites Section 11(b) of the Voting Rights Act, which states that nobody, regardless of their purpose, is allowed to try and threaten, intimidate, or coerce anybody trying to cast a ballot. Trump s so-called  poll watchers  will do exactly that, which is what Dworkin is worried about.The FBI and DOJ know what Trump says at his rallies. He s claimed that Hillary has undocumented immigrants coming in specifically to vote for her; he s claimed that polls should be carefully watched so nobody votes twice, and everyone attempting to vote is legally allowed to vote, and he screams repeatedly that the election will be rigged against him.So it s not like the DCAT is grasping at straws, trying to draw a picture that doesn t exist. It does. And Trump should be terrified of it. Read the full complaint below:Dcat FBI Vra Memo by Grant Stern on Scribd If you witness or experience any type of voter suppression or intimidation when you go to vote, call this number: 1-866-OUR-VOTE.

Both felt that this goal could best be achieved by a secret band of men united to one another by devotion to the common cause and by personal loyalty to one another.

 Twitter Mocks The Hell Out Of Trump For Latest Poorly-Spelled Screed Against Obama (TWEETS),"When Trump promised to  drain the swamp,  he surely wasn t talking about the vile, horrible place that is his Twitter timeline.

DWTo integration commissioner  zoguz the problem lies in the fact that decision-makers in associations like DITIB have never really settled in Germany,  although for the most part, the members have.In other words, the leaders of the most powerful Muslim group in Germany have no interest in assimilating with Germans, but do have an interest in accepting public funds from German taxpayers to keep their organization up and running.However, DITIB does not seem capable of surviving only off Ankara s support and without help from Germany. After payments to the association were temporarily suspended because of the espionage affair, the money has been flowing into its accounts again. According to the German Ministry of Family Affairs,  It was decided that funding for projects that have already been approved would resume under consideration of all relevant aspects.

 Maddow Mocks GOP By Turning Their Freak Out About Trump Into Poetry And Performing It,"MSNBC host Rachel Maddow found the perfect way to simultaneously report and mock the conservative movement s collective freak out that they saddled themselves with Donald Trump as a presidential nominee. She looks their actual words, turned them into spoken word poetry and performed them live on-air.Maddox introduced the segment by claiming she was taking a moment to honor the concerns  of Republicans across the country who, after several years of swinging to the right, landed there with Trump. The Sarah Palins, Rick Perrys and Chris Christies of the party might well be happy to pump Trump, but far greater numbers have simply refused.It speaks volumes about how far the GOP has fallen, that George W. Bush, considered at home and abroad one of the worst and extremist Presidents in US history   is now looking like the moderate wing of the party. Both George W. Bush and his father and former President George Bush Sr have announced their refusal to back Trump in his campaign to be the next President of the United States.Not only does Dubya appear moderate next to Trump, he appears articulate too. Explaining his reasons for rejecting the Trump campaign, he said: I understand that Americans are angry and frustrated. But we do not need someone in the Oval Office who mirrors and inflames our anger and frustration. The former presidents have since been joined by Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney, and Benn Sasse   with other big names in the GOP yet to make their position known.It was all too much for Maddow, who decided to turn this unholy mess into art   and make a seriously hilarious skit out of it all. She takes verbatim quotes from Republicans freaking out about Trump and performs them with all the sincerity of a performance poet.

" Paul Ryan Sharpens His Backstabbing Knife, Prepares War With White House (VIDEO)","During Donald Trump s meltdown during his rally in Phoenix Tuesday evening, he threatened to shut down the government unless Congress funds his border wall. The former reality show star launched a rant which was so insane that people are starting to question whether he s fit to hold office. We re pretty sure that House Speaker Paul Ryan is wondering that, too, after Trump s screamy-ragey speech.On Wednesday, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) said he doesn t  think a government shutdown is necessary,  however, we ve noticed that when the Republican leader says something in stark contrast to Trump s rhetoric, he never says it to his face. Like, for example, when he tweeted his denouncement of the Nazis who marched in Trump s name in Charlottesville, Virginia, with one of them murdering Heather Heyer, 32, and injuring 19 others, he failed to tag @RealDonaldTrump.But anyway, Ryan said during a press conference in Hillsboro, Oregon,  I don t think a government shutdown is necessary, and I don t think most people want to see a government shutdown, ourselves included. Ryan continued to say that  Congress in the House has already done its work on this issue  and left it up to the Senate. Given the time of year it is, and the rest of the appropriations we have to do, we re going to need more time to complete our appropriations process, particularly in the Senate,  he said.Talking Points Memo reports:Trump on Tuesday night suggested he would push to tie funding for his proposed border wall to a government spending bill Congress must pass in the fall to avert a shutdown. I don t think anyone s interested in having a shutdown. I don t think it s in our interest to do so,  Ryan added.  I don t think you have to choose between the two.

 Paul Ryan Attacks President Obama For Being ‘Distracted’ By Murdered Children,"On Monday, President Obama announced that he was expanding background checks to close the  gun show loophole  and ordering federal authorities to more aggressively enforce the current gun laws. Republicans, predictably, went insane and started screaming  tyranny  and  unconstitutional.  In the world of the GOP gun nut the president   or any lawmaker for that matter   should not ever, EVER try to make this country a safer place because .FREEDOM!One day after announcing his executive action on gun laws, President Obama held a press conference to explain why he felt it was important that he take action. The president was introduced by Mark Barden, whose son Daniel was killed in the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, and when Obama spoke of the twenty children who died that day he broke down and cried in front of the nation. Callous Republicans immediately accused him of  faking  his tears for political gain   new Speaker of the House Paul Ryan was one of those people.Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) spoke to Yahoo News s Katie Couric, on Thursday, where he was asked if he was moved by the president s tears on Tuesday. The Republican responded: I was affected by it, but I thought we should ve had the same kind of reaction when James Foley was beheaded, when San Bernardino and Paris occurred. That s the kind of reaction I had when those occurred. Really? He can t understand why the news of twenty FIRST-GRADERS being murdered in their classrooms was a little bit more emotional? These children, six-and-seven years old, were itty bitty and each of their bodies had between three and eleven bullets in them; they were literally riddled with bullets. All of the mass shootings we have experienced over the last decade and a half have been horrifying, but this one was especially hard because the majority of the victims were so small. But Paul Ryan can t understand why this particular one makes the president cry. Okay.Ryan wasn t done yet, he went on to say that the president was using gun control as a  distraction : What I think he s trying to do is distract from basically his failed policies I think the president should put as much effort into going after homegrown jihadists and going after terrorist infiltration of our refugee network and going after defeating ISIS as he is in trying to frustrate the law-abiding citizens  Second Amendment rights. This scumbag actually believes that trying to prevent more gun massacres is the president trying to distract from  real  problems. As if keeping our kids alive isn t a big deal. He thinks our time would be better spent going after the mythical ISIS fighters who are hiding among refugees or  homegrown jihadists ? Why? Because going after  law-abiding  citizens like Dylann Roof, Adam Lanza and the hundreds of other white American terrorists we have in this country is tyranny. Seems legit.Ryan opened his mouth and proved to us, once again, why it is so damn important that we get off of our sofas and vote next November. If we sit at home, we are just giving the Gun Nuts of America  license to kill more of our kids and loved ones. We are one of the most powerful countries in the world and we can t even send our children to school and know that they will come back to us.

BREAKING: DEMS TRY TO SCAPEGOAT: Release Colin Powell’s E-mail To Hillary…Only Proving They’re Both Corruptocrats,"The top Democrat on the House committee investigating Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton s use of a private email system released an email exchange Wednesday between former Secretary of State Colin Powell and Clinton in which he advised her on circumventing State Department servers.The exchange between Clinton and Powell, two days before the start of her tenure as secretary of state, shows Clinton asked him for advice on the use of a BlackBerry. He responded with multiple tips, saying he used a personal computer for government and personal business that wasn t  going through the State Department servers. Powell said,  I even used it to do business with some foreign leaders and some of the senior folks in the Department on their personal email accounts. The emails were cited in the FBI s notes from their investigation into Clinton s and her aides  handling of classified information during her time at the State Department. According to The Wall Street Journal, the FBI quoted some, but not all, of the conversations between Powell and Clinton.Clinton has told federal authorities she didn t follow Powell s guidance, even though she used a private email account to handle government business. FBI Director James Comey recommended no charges be brought against Clinton, but said that she had been  extremely careless  with classified information.What exactly Powell advised Clinton to do had been a matter of debate, and Powell even recently suggested Clinton s allies were trying to pin the controversy on him. Democrats released the full exchange in a bid to show that Clinton s predecessors did not use official email accounts.In his Jan. 23, 2009, response to Clinton, Powell said he used a  personal computer  and a PDA.The latest release appears to show that Powell acknowledged he exchanged work-related emails with foreign leaders and State Department officials using a personal device. He said the setup allowed him to  bypass the government s computer network. The release of the email by Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md. came on the eve of a House Oversight hearing in which Republicans are expected to focus on Clinton s use of a private email server and whether the State Department had been forthcoming with Freedom of Information requests.However, Cummings came down on Republicans accusing lawmakers of holding Clinton to a double standard during the investigation into her private email server. If Republicans were truly concerned with transparency, strengthening FOIA, and preserving federal records, they would be attempting to recover Secretary Powell s emails from AOL, but they have taken no steps to do so despite the fact that this period including the run-up to the Iraq War was critical to our nation s history,  he said.Read more: FOX News",politics,"Sep 8, 2016",2787
MUSLIMS SILENT AFTER TERROR ATTACKS…BUT BLAME TRUMP After Witnesses Give Description Of “Tall Hispanic” Who Killed NY Imam And Assistant [VIDEO],"Whenever we have a terror attack in America, the media goes to great lengths to make sure no one assumes of the killer was a Muslim. Meanwhile, the media has gone out of their way to convince Americans that all Hispanics hate Trump. Isn t it interesting how quickly they print a story about the murderer of two Muslim men who witnesses describe as a  tall Hispanic man  and then blame Trump?An imam and his assistant were shot and killed in broad daylight as they walked home from a mosque in Queens. That s not what America is about,  Khairul Islam, 33, a local resident told the Daily News.  We blame Donald Trump for this. Trump and his drama has created Islamophobia. Another Imam, whose name is unknown at the moment, also blamed the real estate mogul and former NYC mayor for the shooting.  For those in leadership like Trump and Mr. Giuliani, and other members of other institutions that project Islam and Muslims as the enemy, this is the end result of their wickedness,  the Imam said at a gathering of Muslims protesting the shooting.Other Muslim gatherings were chanting  This is Donald Trump s fault,  and  Muslim hate crime. Witnesses providing leads to the NYPD described the shooter as a tall man of Hispanic descent. The NYPD is currently conducting an extensive canvass of the area for video and seeking additional witnesses as the shooter remains at large.   Breitbart",left-news,"Aug 14, 2016",1386
 The Latest Delusion From Devin Nunes Will Make You SICK — This Is Exactly Why He Can’t Be Trusted,"Representative Devin Nunes, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said on Wednesday that the Democrats are  not serious  about the investigation into Russia s interference in the 2016 presidential election. We re beginning to figure out who s actually serious about the investigation because it appears like the Democrats aren t really serious about this investigation,  he told reporters, according to Politico.This is the same Nunes who snuck onto the White House grounds to meet an unnamed source last week, then switched cars and ditched aides, then vanished into the night so that the next day he could make an announcement to defend alleged president Donald Trump. Nunes, while refusing to name his source, said that he had seen evidence that Trump associates were  incidentally  surveilled after the election.The top Democrat on the committee, Adam Schiff, and other Democrats, are calling for Nunes to recuse himself from the Russia probe. Nunes has refused to do so.Nunes alleges that the Democrats have not given him a witness list and added that as far as he knew they had done  very little  to read the documents provided by the intelligence agencies, according to Politico. So, at the end of the day here, we re going to get to the truth, we re going to find out who s actually doing a real investigation,  Nunes said.Nunes, who literally went around the very committee he chairs, to bring Trump  evidence  amid one of the biggest scandals to ever hit the White House, claims that Democrats aren t serious about a probe into Russia s meddling of our election.Sure, accuse the other side of what you re guilty of, Rep. Nunes.So far, only one Republican lawmaker has stepped forward to call for Nunes to recuse himself from the investigation. Hopefully, more Republicans will locate their conscience in order to disallow a hostile foreign government from underminding our election process in the future.Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images.",News,"March 29, 2017",1956

 Trump-Loving Santa Removed From Mall After Trash-Talking Hillary Clinton To Kids (VIDEO),"Mall Santas have one job: be jolly. Unfortunately, that was too much for one Trump-loving douchebag in a red suit to handle.WWLP reports that a mall Santa was removed from the building after he was caught bashing Hillary Clinton when he was supposed to be listening to what kids wanted for Christmas. The unnamed fake-bearded Deplorable was working at the Seminole Towne Center in Sanford, Florida when he told a little girl she was on his  nice list    which would be sweet if it wasn t a lead-in to an attack on the winner of the popular vote. Do you know who is on my naughty list?  the creepy Santa asked the little girl.  Hillary Clinton.  In fact, according to Santa, the former Secretary of State s name is the only one on the naughty list. Then he laughed like he just did something clever rather than prove to a child that Santa is a terrible person.The girl s mother called management and Santa was quickly dragged away to the North Pole (or HR mediation, whichever you prefer) so he would not be a further terrible influence on children. He was replaced with another of Santa s helpers   hopefully one who knows that it s not St. Nick s job to talk politics with children.A spokesman for the Noerr Programs, the company in charge of staffing mall Santas, said in a statement that the Santa will not be fired from his job, but that he was  given additional training. He is allowed to work with children at another location, but will not be returning to the Seminole Towne Center. It is unclear to how many other children Santa spread his poisonous message of hate, but no amount of training can keep him from being a terrible person.Watch a report on the incident below:Featured image via Defend Christmas",News,"November 20, 2016",1715
 Fox News Goes Completely Racist When Reporting Dead Gorilla Story (VIDEO),"Last weekend, news feeds everywhere were filled with the horrific story of a beautiful silverback gorilla being shot after a 3-year-old boy fell into his enclosure.Anyone who s a parent knows that kids are very slippery. They know that in the blink of an eye, a child can become distracted and run off. Still, rather than blame the Cincinnati Zoo for possibly overreacting, people were blaming the parents. Some of those people, including Fox News, though, are taking that line of blame to a whole new level. They are adding a solid dose of racism.Here s a video of the gorilla with the boy, decide for yourself if the gorilla was trying to hurt or save the boy:The boy and his parents are African-American   a detail which would be meaningless if it weren t for Fox News and racists across the nation. Many people blamed the parents, and the mother, who was at the zoo with her boy and other children, certainly deserves her share of it, but Fox and their classy followers are blaming the father, who wasn t even there. The father, it appears, served time in prison.The Daily Mail, which is one of Great Britain s conservative, lowbrow newspapers, reported that the boy s father, Deonne Dickerson, has a criminal history. He was convicted in 2006 for drug trafficking. He was also charged with numerous other charges, including criminal trespass, disorderly conduct and kidnapping.The Daily Mail does note, however, that Dickerson has appeared to turn his life around. That didn t stop Fox News from running with the story, though. The father has a long rap sheet, including drugs and kidnapping charges,  Fox News host Abby Huntsman noted at the beginning of the program. Some say the parents need to be charged,  co-host Ainsley Earhardt later told wildlife expert Grant Kemmerer,  bringing up the dad s past criminal history who wasn t even there at the zoo at the time. The father wasn t even there. Think about that. Fox News is advocating criminally charging a man who wasn t even there. The fact is, Fox and their viewers won t be happy until all black men are behind bars.Here s the video:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 31, 2016",2137
 Anti-Gay Texas Attorney General Faces Disbarment,"The Texas Bar Association is stepping up to the plate to nail Ken Paxton for violating legal ethics.After the Supreme Court ruled same-sex marriage legal across the nation last summer, some red states threw a collective hissy fit over the decision. In Alabama, state Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore ordered county judges to disobey the highest court in the land.Texas Republicans also threw a temper tantrum, especially Attorney General Ken Paxton, who told county clerks to defy the Supreme Court ruling as well.  I will do everything I can from this office to be a public voice for those standing in defense of their rights,  Paxton vowed a day after the ruling came down. But unlike Moore, Ken Paxton could end up losing his status on the bar.Because he told clerks to violate the law as interpreted by the Supreme Court, the Texas Bar Association has launched an investigation against Paxton for ethics violations.The new investigation against Paxton comes on top of his indictment for committing securities fraud. If convicted, he faces up to 99 years in prison.Houston lawyer Eddie Rodriguez said that the Board of Disciplinary Appeals is looking into whether or not Paxton should be disbarred, which would prevent him from practicing law in the state, provided being thrown in prison doesn t do the trick first. Attorney General Paxton has a right to disagree with a ruling of the Supreme Court,  Rodriguez told Reuters.  Lawyers do that every single day. What makes a difference is that you cannot encourage people to violate that ruling and that law. Of course, Paxton denies being an unethical slug. This complaint has always lacked merit, and we are confident the legal process for resolving these complaints will bear that out,  a statement from his office said.As usual, it will take time for the investigation to run its course before a decision is made, but it s hard to believe a legitimate bar association would allow Paxton to continue being a lawyer since it is clear that he defied federal law and the order of the Supreme Court to let same-sex couples legally marry. If they don t remove him from the bar, what does that say about the ethics of the Texas Bar Association itself?Featured image from texasattorneygeneral.gov",News,"February 11, 2016",2249

 Dianne Feinstein: Trump Is ‘Splitting’ The United States Apart,"Senator Dianne Feinstein went on Fox News this Sunday and ripped President Trump a new one.Pointing out the rank hypocrisy over Trump s executive actions and how Republicans treated President Obama, Feinstein called on the president to unite the country. Instead of uniting, Feinstein said, he s splitting it apart even more:You ve got people in the streets here. This president has not brought this nation together. He says he s working for his base. Well, there are a majority of people who are outside of that base. My best advice has been, and I was able to say this to him directly,  Please Mr. President, you have to bring this country together.  What he s doing is splitting it apart.Currently, the majority of the United States has an unfavorable view of Trump, who set a record for quickest descent into net negative approval ratings over 50 percent. In contrast, it took President Obama almost 1,000 days to reach that point. Trump did it in eight.Feinstein also blasted Trump for his immigration ban, telling Chris Wallace that he is  not a dictator  and that the Supreme Court will ultimately decide if his executive action is unconstitutional.Similarly, the majority of Americans are sharply disapproving of his immigration executive order, and his handling of terrorism, national security, and immigrant, all key tenets to his 2016 campaign.The most shocking statistic comes from Public Policy Polling, which found 40 percent of the American public wants to impeach President Trump. That number is up 5 points from a similar question asked just a week ago. In comparison, it took 16 months after Watergate for the American public to reach that number in support of Nixon s resignation. Trump s done it in two weeks.Not surprisingly, 88-92 percent of Republicans support of the job President Trump is doing. Only 7-10 percent of Democrats believe so. And every major poll has shown independent voters to be sharply divided, with all polls tilting negative.Senator Feinstein is right: President Trump is splitting this country apart all to appease the small minority who voted for him. All his promises of being the president who bridges the two Americas has completely fallen flat.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"February 5, 2017",2235
 Everyone Needs To Read Obama’s Remarks After Two More Black Men Fall To Police Brutality,"After yet two more instances of unwarranted police brutality against black men who were simply existing, the nation has once again become divided between those who seek to value life and want to see these senseless killings stop, and those who seek to demonize the recently departed, putting the deceased on trial rather than their murderers.One person who seems to understand the full scope and recklessness of these deaths and unjust killings is President Obama. He just released his remarks after the recent killings of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, LA, and Philando Castile of Falcon Heights, MN.Here is President Obama s statement in full: All Americans should be deeply troubled by the fatal shootings of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and Philando Castile in Falcon Heights, Minnesota. We ve seen such tragedies far too many times, and our hearts go out to the families and communities who ve suffered such a painful loss.Although I am constrained in commenting on the particular facts of these cases, I am encouraged that the U.S. Department of Justice has opened a civil rights investigation in Baton Rouge, and I have full confidence in their professionalism and their ability to conduct a thoughtful, thorough, and fair inquiry.But regardless of the outcome of such investigations, what s clear is that these fatal shootings are not isolated incidents. They are symptomatic of the broader challenges within our criminal justice system, the racial disparities that appear across the system year after year, and the resulting lack of trust that exists between law enforcement and too many of the communities they serve.To admit we ve got a serious problem in no way contradicts our respect and appreciation for the vast majority of police officers who put their lives on the line to protect us every single day. It is to say that, as a nation, we can and must do better to institute the best practices that reduce the appearance or reality of racial bias in law enforcement.That s why, two years ago, I set up a Task Force on 21st Century Policing that convened police officers, community leaders, and activists. Together, they came up with detailed recommendations on how to improve community policing. So even as officials continue to look into this week s tragic shootings, we also need communities to address the underlying fissures that lead to these incidents, and to implement those ideas that can make a difference. That s how we ll keep our communities safe. And that s how we can start restoring confidence that all people in this great nation are equal before the law.In the meantime, all Americans should recognize the anger, frustration, and grief that so many Americans are feeling   feelings that are being expressed in peaceful protests and vigils. Michelle and I share those feelings. Rather than fall into a predictable pattern of division and political posturing, let s reflect on what we can do better. Let s come together as a nation, and keep faith with one another, in order to ensure a future where all of our children know that their lives matter. Thank you, Mr. President. Your compassion of life and love for all will be a legacy we all shall remember well past your time in office. You are a man of, by and for the people, and it shows each and every day.Featured Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"July 7, 2016",3347

 WATCH: Anderson Cooper Throws MAJOR Shade At White House Aide Over ‘Fake News’,"An interview with CNN anchor Anderson Cooper and Sebastian Gorka Wednesday night went off the rails when the White House deputy assistant started lecturing the host on  fake news.  It s remarkable really because Gorka is  fake.  Even his PhD is fake and yet, he used to insist that everyone call him  Doctor.  Still yet, the fake doctor couldn t help himself and launched into a rant against  fake news. It s laughable. Your chryon talked about a  crisis,  Gorka told Cooper in response to a suggestion that the White House was in turmoil.  I actually work in the West Wing, I work in the White House, it is absolutely nothing of the kind. The president is a steam locomotive that can t be stopped. It s just fake news. I m sad to see CNN fall to this,  Gorka said.  I know you want salacious and sensational coverage for your ratings so your corporate sponsors and owners will have more money, but that s not media, that s not reportage. It s just fake news. Okay, I m just going to ignore the insults because I don t think it really gets us anywhere,  Cooper shot back.Cooper pressed Gorka over a tweet which Trump posted on Twitter saying the media often makes up its sources, despite the fact that Trump Jr. released the email chain which confirms The New York Times  reporting.Remember, when you hear the words ""sources say"" from the Fake Media, often times those sources are made up and do not exist.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 12, 2017 I m giving you an opportunity right now to correct what the president said this morning. Because what he s alleging is that the reporting is fake and in fact, his son s own email chain shows that it s accurate. Do you deny that?  Cooper asked. No, I deny the fact that there is anything here that is untoward. Again this is an obsessive nine-month campaign,  Gorka said.An exhausted Gorka eventually said,  I thought we were going to talk about real issues, like what we re doing with our allies in France, defeating ISIS. I am going to ask you but you re not being honest, you re not being upfront,  Cooper responded. How many minutes are we in?  Gorka said. Are you a TV producer now?  Cooper fired back.  You re concerned about how many minutes we ve been talking? Do you have somewhere else to go? If you gotta go, you gotta go. You re falling into the fake news trap again,  said Gorka.  And it s sad, Anderson. You re shaking shiny objects to try to divert people, but I don t think viewers are really that easily diverted,  Cooper said. Do you know why the president s description of a witch hunt is accurate,  Gorka asked.  Because there never were witches. And there never was any collusion. It s bogus   Anderson, you re like a broken record. No, because I m not getting any answers from you,  replied Cooper. I m answering it. Every time,  said Gorka. No, you re responding,  said Cooper.  You re not actually answering because you re not actually being up front. Let s let the viewers judge,  Gorka said, who then mocked CNN s ratings. You used that line on Monday, and you know, it was sort of mildly amusing,  Cooper said.  But I think it s funny that you have enough time in the White House, which is apparently you re so busy, you re able to sit around [and] read Nielsen numbers. No, I had really good prep from my team, because the White House press team is superb,  Gorka said.  I don t deal with this stuff because I do have a day job. Watch a clip from the interview:.@andersoncooper fires back at @SebGorka:  I m just going to ignore the insults,  I don t think it gets us anywhere https://t.co/CbyGcCWsLd  Anderson Cooper 360  (@AC360) July 13, 2017Cooper brought up that CNN apologized for an inaccurate story but Trump has never corrected his errors.

 Ted Cruz’s Crazy Dad Goes Off About What Will Happen If His Son Doesn’t Win The Election (AUDIO),"Since Jeb Bush started to bring his mother Barbara Bush with him on the campaign trail, it s become more common for the parents of the Republican presidential candidates to swoop in and give their struggling little GOPers a boost.Pastor Rafael Cruz, the father of Texas senator and presidential candidate Ted Cruz, tried to do the same for his own son during a chat with Greg Corombos of WorldNetDaily over the weekend, to basically talk about how his son is going to  eclipse Trump and emerge as the nominee.  Considering that Rafael is Ted s campaign surrogate and a religious man, this of course meant some fear-mongering and crazy Christianity references similar to the time he claimed that God was raising up Ted to be the next POTUS.This time, the elder Cruz was on a real mission to convince America that God is behind his son s candidacy and will make sure that he wins the election. Rafael said: I think what is going to happen is the body of Christ is going to rise up. Believers are coalescing around Ted Cruz and I think when the people of God realize that we need a man of faith, a man of integrity, a man that you can trust his word   two things you can count on Ted Cruz, number one he will tell you the truth, and number two, he will do exactly what he says he s going to do. That Rafael called his son a  man of truth  is hilarious, as Cruz was just slammed in the media for spreading false information about Marco Rubio. Rafael also boasted about his son s ability to be the most outspoken homophobe running for president. Rafael reference the Supreme Court ruling on marriage equality, proudly stating that his son was the only candidate who said the ruling was  not the law of the land, this is an unconstitutional, unlawful decision and five justices have no right to impose their view upon 320 million Americans. Rafael topped off his insane claims with a warning, reminding Americans that  this election is the most important election of our lifetime,  and that if they didn t vote Ted into the White House,  a lot of our freedoms would disappear .You can listen to the crazy interview below:[soundcloud url= https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/248365072  params= color=ff5500  width= 100%  height= 166  iframe= true  /]Rafael Cruz honestly just makes his son look like an even more terrifying candidate whenever he speaks.

"LOL! WHOOPI GOLDBERG Caught Telling HUGE LIE During Interview With Newt Gingrich, As The View Hacks Tried To Prove President Trump’s a “Liar” [VIDEO]","Newt Gingrich was promoting his new book  Understanding Trump  on The View today. The leftist hacks of the The View took advantage of his appearance to play  gotcha,  as they attempted to find ways to coerce a confession out of Newt that President Trump is a  liar.  Newt wasn t falling for it however. While many of us would have preferred to see Gingrich take off the gloves with the hosts of The View, he chose instead to sit back and sling a few arrows on an  as needed  basis.The not-funny comedian Joy Behar attempted to paint Trump as a serial  liar  and was surprised when Gingrich shot back with, You mean like  you can keep your doctor, you can keep your insurance ? You want to talk about lies by a president?  Behar responded by attempting to convince Gingrich that Barack Obama didn t lie when he told one of his most famous lies to the American people, and that it was simply a  misjudgment  on his part.Near the end of the interview, Whoopi Goldberg went through a list of questions she used to vet Gingrich and prove how credible he was based on his answers. When the subject of the popularity of President Trump came up in the discussion, Gingrich confessed that he was shocked at how well Trump was doing considering a recent Harvard study that showed 93% of the post-election coverage of President Trump was negative coverage. Whoopi appeared to be close to needing medical attention after Gingrich rightfully pointed out the disgusting lopsided negative coverage that President Trump s received since he was elected. Since Goldberg had no honest rebuttal to offer, she made up a whopper of a lie, telling Gingrich and her viewers that prior to the election, 98% of candidate Trump s media coverage was  positive  and went on to suggest that was the reason he won.Sorry Whoopi but here are the actual facts about the percentage of negative coverage Trump received from the mainstream media prior to the election:From the liberal Politico: A whopping 91 percent of news coverage about Donald Trump on the three broadcast nightly newscasts over the past 12 weeks has been  hostile , a new study finds.The study, conducted by the conservative Media Research Center, found that not only has Trump received significantly more broadcast network news coverage than his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, but nearly all of that coverage (91%) has been hostile, according to the study.Watch the interview here:In addition, the networks spent far more airtime focusing on the personal controversies involving Trump, such as his treatment of women, than controversies surrounding Clinton, such as her email practices or the Clinton Foundation.For the study, MRC analyzed all 588 evening news stories that either discussed or mentioned the presidential campaign on the ABC, CBS and NBC evening newscasts from July 29 through October 20 (including weekends). Of the total newscasts, the networks devoted 29 percent of their time to the campaign. The study did not include comments from the campaigns or candidates themselves, instead focusing on what the correspondents, anchors, expert commentators, and voters on the street said in order to try and hone in on any sort of slant from the networks.Though neither candidate was necessarily celebrated, Clinton largely just stayed out of the line of fire. Even when they were critical of Hillary Clinton   for concealing her pneumonia, for example, or mischaracterizing the FBI investigation of her e-mail server   network reporters always maintained a respectful tone in their coverage,  the study found.  This was not the case with Trump, who was slammed as embodying  the politics of fear,  or a  dangerous  and  vulgar   misogynistic bully  who had insulted vast swaths of the American electorate. 98% Of Pre-Election Trump Coverage Was  Positive Actual Percentage Of  Positive  Trump Coverage Is SHOCKING!",left-news,"Jun 13, 2017",3864
 UNC Campus Police LAUGH In Rape Victim’s Face . . . Because Football,"A woman was raped by a football player at the University of North Carolina and she says that when she reported the attack to campus police, they laughed in her face.Delaney Robinson decided to go public with her horrific ordeal because she felt it would be the only way to get justice since the school would obviously rather protect a sports star than prosecute a sexual assault. Speaking at a press conference, Robinson said that on the night of Feb. 14, Tar Heels junior linebacker Allen Artis brutally raped her in a dorm room while she was  incapacitated. Denise Branch, Robinson s attorney, said that her client went to the hospital following the assault, where they examined her and collected evidence with a rape kit. According to hospital records, Robinson suffered  vaginal injuries consistent with blunt-force trauma and bruising consistent with a physical assault. But when she reported the sexual assault to campus police, they simply laughed in her face and asked her a litany of offensive, victim-blaming questions. I was treated like a suspect,  she said.  What was I wearing? What was I drinking? How much did I drink? How much did I eat that day? Did I lead him on? Have I hooked up with him before? Do I often have one-night stands? Did I even say no? What is my sexual history? How many men have I slept with? Robinson added that she was allowed to listen to an audio recording her attacker s interrogation, and it was much different than what she had been forced to endure. Rather than accusing him of anything, the investigators spoke to him with a tone of camaraderie,  Robinson said.  They provided reassurances to him when he became upset. They even laughed with him when he told them how many girls  phone numbers he had managed to get on the same night he raped me. Robinson freely admits that she had been drinking on the night in question, but according to the  assistant district attorney for Orange County  unconsciousness is rape, blackout drunk is not rape. After police and prosecutors convinced Robinson that there was no way she had enough evidence to pursue felony charges, she filed two misdemeanor charges. Artis was arrested for the assault on Tuesday and according to District Attorney Jim Woodall, the case is still pending.This case is just the latest incident of rape that has been brushed off thanks to America s rape culture. Brock Turner was released after serving only three months in jail for raping an unconscious woman behind a dumpster. But hey, he had a promising swimming career and athletes get a free pass when it comes to rape.Robinson said her  life has changed forever while the person who assaulted me continues as a student and a football player on this campus. As of Tuesday evening, UNC had not yet released a statement regarding the allegations.Featured image via  Streeter Lecka/Getty Images",News,"September 13, 2016",2855

Toomey s attempt to fool voters. Pat Toomey may have done the right thing on one vote, but courage is telling Pennsylvania voters where you stand on the tough issues, not just the easy ones like background checks,  Obama said in a statement Saturday afternoon.  Pat Toomey won t tell Pennsylvania voters where he stands on Donald Trump, trying instead to have it both ways by telling different people what he thinks they want to hear. That s not courage. Voting to shut down the government and against bills to close the terrorist gun loophole isn t courage.

President Obama is scheduled to campaign in Pennsylvania on Monday, where polls show Hillary Clinton ahead of Trump, but have McGinty and Toomey in a neck-and-neck contest.The President is almost sure to make some reference to Toomey s sad campaign ad, and tweak him over the desperate nature of the attempt.Democrats believe that Toomey s seat is key to their strategy to take back the majority of seats in the Senate. Currently, online prediction models show the party with a slightly over 60% likelihood of doing so. Having a Democratic Senate with Clinton in the White House would be key to nominating a Supreme Court justice, maintaining the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and getting some of Clinton s proposed legislative agenda made into actual law.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video ",News,"November 5, 2016",2015
 WATCH: Hillary Smacks Trump With His Own Words On The Issues In New Video Series,"Donald Trump has made a lot of offensive statements over the years, and Hillary Clinton is using them against him in a series of short video clips to educate people on what their possible next president thinks. The first in a new series: a message from your potential next president on pregnancy,  Clinton says to introduce the clip on Twitter.It s only an 18 second snippet. Hail to the Chief plays in the background and then Donald Trump appears to give his brief thoughts on pregnancy. Well you know, pregnancy is never   it s a wonderful thing for the woman, it s a wonderful thing for the husband, it s certainly an inconvenience for business,  Trump says.Here s the video via Twitter.The first in a new series: a message from your potential next president on pregnancy.https://t.co/LmUZI20JCo  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) May 27, 2016So all you women out there who manage to work and have a family, Trump wants you to know that you are an  inconvenience for business. Yeah, that s probably going to piss off a lot of women. And that s the point. Hillary Clinton is laying the groundwork for the general election by releasing these short clips featuring Trump and all the stupid and offensive remarks he has made on issue after issue over the years.Trump is already the Republican nominee so if Hillary captures the Democratic nomination, she would be battling Trump for the White House and America s future.The orange-tanned businessman certainly has a steep cliff to climb when it comes to women voters.70 percent of women hold an unfavorable view of Trump. And an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll shows Clinton leading Trump 51 to 38 percent among female voters, a 13 point gap that is wider than President Obama s victory over Mitt Romney among women in 2012. NPR reports that if the numbers hold the gender gap would be the widest it has ever been since 1952, which makes it clear that the Republican Party is in serious trouble if they think they can win election merely by courting the votes of white old men.Hillary certainly has plenty of ammunition to fire at Trump with future videos, too. After all, we re talking about a guy who has suggested on mulitple occasions that he wants to have incestuous relations with his daughter, a guy who has openly stated that he is more interested in getting women pregnant than he is in helping to take care of the kids after they are born. I like kids,  Trump once said.  I mean, I won t do anything to take care of them. I ll supply funds and she ll take care of the kids. It s quotes like this that could bury Trump this November if Hillary Clinton gathers enough of them to use in short videos that will definitely appeal to those who don t have the patience to sit through an entire Trump interview or debate.Trump and and GOP should take note, because it looks like their poll numbers are about to get worse.Featured image via screenshot ",News,"May 27, 2016",2904
MUSLIM CLOCK BOY’S LIE EXPOSED [Video] Expert Proves Boy Who Received Invitation To White House And Thousands In Donations Story Was A Hoax,"Everything about this muslim boy s story is a lie. From the first lie that he made the clock to the lie about him being unfairly targeted by the school. But in the Muslim faith, it s okay to lie (taqiya)as long as you re promoting your faith. In Shi a Islam, taqiya (  taqiyyah/taq yah) is a form of religious veil, or a legal dispensation whereby a believing individual can deny his faith or commit otherwise illegal or blasphemous acts, especially while they are in fear or at risk of significant persecution.Our  President  Barack Obama brazenly supported and promoted the  persecution  of this poor Muslim boy:Cool clock, Ahmed. Want to bring it to the White House? We should inspire more kids like you to like science. It's what makes America great.  President Obama (@POTUS44) September 16, 2015 Cool clock, Ahmed. Want to bring it to the White House? We should inspire more kids like you to like science. It s what makes America great.  President Barack Obama, September 16, 2015It was a Hoax.Ahmed Mohamed s claims that he assembled a clock at home that he took to school is starting to unravel.Two investigators who have studied the image of Mohamed s device provided by Irving, Texas police have concluded that Mohamed did not make the clock. Both conclude that Mohamed disassembled a manufactured clock and installed it in a large pencil box without its casing. And both say it is possible it was done to provoke suspicion or to resemble a bomb.Update: Clock has been identified as being sold in a 1986 Radio Shack catalogue by an Art Voice reader. The headline and text for this article has been changed to reflect the update.14-year-old Mohamed, a Muslim, was briefly arrested and investigated for bringing a hoax bomb to MacArthur High School in Irving, Texas on Monday. He was subsequently cleared.Thousands of dollars have been donated to Ahmed Mohamed in just the past few days, reported CNN. On Monday, 14-year-old Mohamed was arrested for taking a homemade clock to school that his teachers thought was a bomb. So crowdfunding platform LaunchGood started a campaign to raise $100,000 for the Muslim teen. In just one day, the site had raised over $10,000 from more than 200 backers. It s hoping to raise $100,000 by October 13. The support for it has been amazing,  said Chris Abdur-Rahman Blauvelt, CEO of LaunchGood, which supports projects started by Muslims or ones that are tied to the history and study of Islam. Blauvelt said his campaign has the approval of Mohamed s family. He said half of the money donated will go toward a scholarship fund for Mohamed and the rest to efforts that foster creativity and inventiveness in kids. In addition to LaunchGood, crowdfunding platform Gofundme has also launched a campaign for Mohamed. It s raised more than $4,000 with a goal of $60,000 that will go toward Mohamed s future college tuition. Thomas Talbot posted a video to YouTube explaining the various parts in the photo of Mohamed s briefcase clock belong to a manufactured alarm clock.

CHARLIE DANIELS WARNS LIBERALS: Knock It Off Or “There Will Be Blood In The Streets!”,"Over a century ago, the United States of America went through a divisive and bloody Civil War that separated the people of this nation bone from marrow. It split friends, families and eventually the nation itself as a line was drawn dividing the Union States of the North from the newly formed Confederacy of the Southern States.Ostensibly, the war that followed was fought over the abolition of slavery, a devilish practice that never should have been allowed in the first place, and although it was the basic issue for the conflict   as is the case so much of the time   there were a myriad of other issues involved.One   in my opinion   was just plain stubbornness and pride and the dogged determination that the South would not let itself be told what to do by the other half of the country, but trade, tariffs and different attitudes and beliefs about just how far a federal government could go in setting the tone and making laws to be obeyed by all the states were also involved.The point I m trying to make is that the feelings festered so long and ran so deep that men whose fathers had stood shoulder to shoulder in the war for independence faced off across fields of battle and killed each other.The Civil War never should have happened, and had cooler heads prevailed on both sides, never would have. Southerners had to know that slavery was an abomination to the principles they had fought and died for in the Revolution.No man has the right to own another man, to reap the fruits of his labor for nothing, to consider his children nothing more than commodities to be sold off or traded away on a whim, separating families and breeding human beings like livestock.But instead of acknowledging the very obvious evil of this situation, politicians from the South, convinced that the economy of the Southern States was dependent on slavery, chose to become a separate nation and soon after over six hundred thousand Americans lost their lives in a senseless war that would set the Southern States back a half century.Surely, had it been approached by fair, level-headed men on both sides of the issue, abolition could have been achieved without war. But the rhetoric grew ever hotter. Brash young men on both sides, who had never fired a gun in anger, viewed a war as the pinnacle of romanticism, and implacable politicians refused to give an inch. Is this not the same attitude we see on the streets of America today?I see young people interviewed on television who can t even articulate the reason they are protesting. Others bent on destruction who probably espouse no cause but chaos.I ve seen hysterical protestors screaming about First Amendment rights which they seem to think only protect them and those who think like them and that the opposition has no First Amendment protection and should be shouted down at all costs.The rhetoric is becoming hotter and more nonsensical, the radical element more apparent, the violence and destruction of property more common place.The pot is boiling and it s only a matter of time before there will be blood on the streets.Americans have the right to civil disobedience, a right to gather and demonstrate against some policy they feel is unfair or harmful to the country at large, but they do not have the right to interrupt commerce, break windows, burn cars or do bodily harm to those who disagree with them.People who won t listen to reason, who ignore the law of the land and who try to stifle the opinions of others tend to forget that there is an element of violence on the other side as well, a side that, thankfully, so far has not yet come forth.But, should these conditions continue, someday soon the violent elements of both persuasions will find themselves on the same streets, and what will ensue will not be pretty.Learn from history, or repeat it.What do you think?Pray for our troops, our police and the peace of Jerusalem.God Bless America  Charlie DanielsCharlie Daniels is a legendary American singer, song writer, guitarist, and fiddler famous for his contributions to country and southern rock music.

GOP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE MARCO RUBIO CASTS DECIDING VOTE ON OBAMATRADE…Never Even Read It,"One more Republican doing his part to aid Obama in his fundamental transformation of America Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) cast the deciding vote for Obamatrade on Tuesday as it squeeked through the U.S. Senate 60-37, and his Senate office is still outright refusing to answer whether he even knew what he was voting on.Rubio, a Republican presidential candidate, was the deciding vote necessary for the U.S. Senate to clear the final 60-vote threshold and eventually, later this week, send to President Barack Obama s desk the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) bill that would fast-track at least three highly secretive trade deals that Obama has been negotiating for years.TPA will, now that it s going to pass, effectively ensure the congressional approval of the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA) and Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP). The text of the TiSA and T-TIP agreements is currently entirely secretive, even to lawmakers on Capitol Hill and their staffs, though WikiLeaks did uncover several TiSA documents that leaked and prove the deal would surrender congressional power over U.S. immigration policy to the executive branch and perhaps to a newly created transnational entity.The TPP text for the Pacific Rim trade deal that Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL)80% notes would give the Sultan of Brunei who has implemented Sharia Law in his nation and banned Christmas, literally an  equal vote to that of the United States,  on the other hand, is available for members of Congress to read. The only catch is they have to go to a secret room inside the Capitol basement for classified readings to read it in person, they can t take notes, and only their staffers with enough high enough security clearances can go with them to read it and their staff can t go without them.Before the Senate voted on TPA to fast track these deals the first time back in May, Breitbart News asked every Senate Republican if they read the text of the TPP before voting to fast-track it. Only a handful said they did.Sens. Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY)93% , Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX)93% , Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL)80% , Sen. James Lankford (R-OK)60% and Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT)100% went to go read it. Rubio, on the other hand, was one of many who has consistently and repeatedly refused to answer whether he read the deal text. His office refuse to answer yet again on Tuesday whether he went to go read it before the first time he voted for TPA or before the second time he did on Tuesday s cloture vote and that means he s again choosing to give the public impression he did not read the text of the deal before he voted to fast track it through Congress.This could have significant implications for Rubio on the campaign trail as he seeks the Republican nomination for the presidency as activists in early states are furious with his decision to support Obamatrade when it s clear he doesn t know what he s talking about.New Hampshire conservative and Merrimack Councilman Bill Boyd, who s endorsed Paul for president, told Breitbart News while on a recent reporting trip to New Hampshire that he s upset that Rubio didn t read the deal before he voted to fast-track it. He s been the biggest advocate against Obamacare and the ACA, and for all the time Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA)9% kept on saying  we have to pass this bill to find out what s in it,  Boyd said.You re telling me Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL)80% voted for a bill without reading it? Are you kidding? You know what, we elect people to go down there to represent us. At a bare minimum you have staff. Staff should be providing some kind of an executive summary. If it s a thousand pages, you should be cutting it up and giving it to staff and get 10 or 20 page synopses. If your staff can t bring a particular issue on in a two page memo than they have no idea what they re talking about. For Sen. Rubio to admit that, that s kind of surprising. That s kind of surprising not to read a document and make an opinion without even looking at it. You need to be able to formulate an opinion. If somebody gives you the cliff notes version of a bill, that s at least better than not reading it at all. So that s kind of surprising.

 WATCH: Don Trump Jr. ADMITS On TV That His Father Lied About His Conversations With Comey,"Following James Comey s testimony in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Trump claimed that he d never asked Comey for a loyalty pledge, claimed that he barely knew Comey, and claimed he never told Comey that he hoped the Flynn investigation would be dropped. Comey, for his part, testified that not only did Trump say he hoped he d drop the Flynn investigation, but also said he took it as a directive. Now Trump s son has confirmed Comey s version of events, making his own father out to be the liar we all know he is.That may well have been inadvertent, but it s what he did. It s amusing, really   the junior Trump first said,  We were vindicated!  and then launched into Comey: I think it s clear that everything that went on in the Comey testimony was basically ridiculous. They re saying,  Hey, he never asked me to stop a Russia investigation. Then he goes on to blasting Comey s report that Trump said:  I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.  Junior Trump uses that to paint Comey as both weak and insubordinate as loudly as possible.

" John Oliver Started A Debt Collection Agency, And What He Did With It Will Blow You Away (VIDEO)","John Oliver, of HBO s Last Week Tonight, dove into the deeply shady world of debt buying and collection on his Sunday segment. But Last Week Tonight isn t just about giving out information. The show often does surprising things well in advance of an air date so they can make the biggest impact possible, and Sunday s episode was no exception. What they did will impact 9,000 people in the U.S.So what happened? Oliver started a debt buying/collection agency in Mississippi called Central Asset Recovery Professionals, Inc., or CARP, for short. He used it to show just how easy and cheap it is to get into this business: Debt buying is a grimy business and badly needs more oversight, because as it stands any idiot can get into it. And I can prove that to you because I am an idiot and we started a debt-buying company. And it was disturbingly easy. Not long after CARP incorporated, they were offered a portfolio of medical debt worth nearly $15 million, and given the names, addresses and Social Security numbers of the 9,000 people who owed that debt: We bought it, which is absolutely terrifying because it means if I wanted to, I could legally have CARP take possession of that list and have employees start calling people, turning their lives upside down over medical debt. The portfolio cost CARP $60,0000   they got it for pennies on the dollar. That s the norm for this business.CARP didn t start sending employees after these people like a regular agency, though. Instead, Oliver and Last Week Tonight got together with a charity called RIP Medical Debt, and forgave all $15 million of it. Those 9,000 people don t have to worry about what they owe to hospitals, clinics, and individual practitioners anymore. They might not even have to worry about whether they ll have to file for bankruptcy anymore.John Oliver just wiped out the medical debt of nine thousand people. Let that sink in while you watch the entire segment, which details out just how disgusting and grisly the debt-buying business is, below:We re the only industrialized nation in the world that doesn t have some form of nationalized healthcare available to everyone, and medical debt is the number one reason people file for bankruptcy here. In fact, more than 60 percent of bankruptcies in the U.S. have to do with medical debt. It can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars for one necessary procedure. Cutting-edge cancer treatments can run into the millions.In English, our system is f*cked all to hell because of profit.This move technically cost less than the famous Oprah Winfrey show where she gave her entire audience a new car, spending roughly $8 million. But the impact, and the message, are far greater. Hats off to John Oliver for this.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",News,"June 6, 2016",2782
DARPA Spending $62 Million to Create Military Cyborgs,"21st Century Wire says Science fiction is now science fact.Watch a video of this report here: DARPA s program director for the project says the implant is seeking to open the channel between the human brain and modern electronics. A statement from DARPA said it will enable  data-transfer bandwidth between the human brain and the digital world, feeding digital auditory or visual information into the brain. The research agency claims the project is not intended for military purposes, yet experts believe it will have many military applications. While it could potentially restore senses to injured veterans, it could also be used to heighten the senses of perfectly healthy soldiers.Moreover, let us not forget that it is the Pentagon, the military s central command, whom controls the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency.Either way, DARPA is seeking to perfect the cyborg  an individual with both organic and mechanical body parts.If this device could be used to heighten the awareness of an individual s surroundings, could it also be manipulated to present a misleading perspective on what is happening around the implanted person?Could a soldier be manipulated into believing something was happening due to a certain message being transmitted to the implant, when in actual fact something entirely different was occurring in reality?Such devices present incredibly hard questions for accountability.However, Steven Pinker, a cognitive scientist from Harvard, is sceptical that the device could ever work: We have little to no idea how exactly the brain codes complex information My guess is that it s a waste of taxpayer dollars. Despite these concerns, DARPA is pressing ahead with the project.Do you think we are now a step closer to cyborg super soldiers, or just wasting $62 million?LEARN ALL ABOUT MILITARY SPENDING: 21WIRE Military Industrial Complex Files",US_News,"March 9, 2016",1875
"OBAMA BLAMES RUSSIA For Hillary’s Loss, But NEW HARVARD STUDY Exposes Who REALLY Interfered In Outcome Of Our Elections","A new report from Harvard Kennedy School s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy analyzes news coverage during the 2016 general election, and concludes that both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump received coverage that was overwhelmingly negative in tone and extremely light on policy.This is the final report of a multi-part research series analyzing news coverage of candidates and issues during the 2016 presidential election. The study tracks news coverage from the second week of August 2016 to the day before Election Day.Negative coverage was the order of the day in the general election. Not a week passed where the nominees  coverage reached into positive territory. It peaked at 81 percent negative in mid-October, but there was not a single week where it dropped below 64 percent negative.The press s negative bent is not confined to election politics (see Figure 4).[2] In recent years, when immigration has been the subject of news stories, the ratio of negative stories to positive ones has been 5-to-1. In that same period, news reports featuring Muslims have been 6-to-1 negative. News stories about health care policy, most of which centered on the 2010 Affordable Care Act, have been 2-to-1 negative. Although the nation s economy has steadily improved since the financial crisis of 2008, one would not know that from the tone of news coverage. Since 2010, news stories about the nation s economy have been 2-to-1 negative over positive.The real bias of the press is not that it s liberal. Its bias is a decided preference for the negative. As scholar Michael Robinson noted, the news media seem to have taken some motherly advice and turned it upside down.  If you don t have anything bad to say about someone, don t say anything at all. [3] A New York Times columnist recently asserted that  the internet is distorting our collective grasp on the truth. [4] There s a degree of accuracy in that claim but the problem goes beyond the internet and the talk shows. The mainstream press highlights what s wrong with politics without also telling us what s right.It s a version of politics that rewards a particular brand of politics. When everything and everybody is portrayed as deeply flawed, there s no sense making distinctions on that score, which works to the advantage of those who are more deeply flawed. Civility and sound proposals are no longer the stuff of headlines, which instead give voice to those who are skilled in the art of destruction. The car wreck that was the 2016 election had many drivers. Journalists were not alone in the car, but their fingerprints were all over the wheel.The research is confined to the election coverage in the print editions of five daily papers (the Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, and USA Today) and the main newscasts of five television networks (ABC World News Tonight, CBS Evening News, CNN s The Situation Room, Fox s Special Report, and NBC Nightly News). In the case of the newspapers, the analysis covers all sections except sports, obituaries, and letters to the editor. Op-eds and editorials are included, but letters from the public are not. For television, the analysis covers the full daily content of each network s major newscast. Network talk shows are not included.Trump s general election news coverage fit the pattern of earlier stages of the campaign in several respects but not all. The major departure was that his general election coverage was overwhelmingly negative in tone. In our earlier reports, we documented the positive coverage Trump received during the nominating stage of the campaign, a pattern largely attributable to the press s tendency to highlight the horserace in the pre-primary and primary periods. As Trump rose from single digits in the polls and then won key primaries, he got favorable press. It was a story of growing momentum, rising poll numbers, ever larger crowds, and electoral success. The fact that the horse race is the most heavily covered aspect of the nominating phase magnified Trump s favorable coverage.Trump s general election coverage was a stark contrast. His coverage was negative from the start, and never came close to entering positive territory (see Figure 8).  During his best weeks, the coverage ran 2-to-1 negative over positive. In his worst weeks, the ratio was more than 10-to-1. If there was a silver lining for Trump, it was that his two best weeks were the ones just preceding the November balloting. Trump s coverage was negative in all the news outlets in our study, even those that typically side with the Republican nominee (see Figure 9). Fox provided Trump his most favorable coverage, but it was still nearly 3-to-1 negative over positive. The Wall Street Journal was his next best outlet, but its coverage ran 4-to-1 negative. The most negative coverage was carried by CBS at 9-to-1, but Trump s coverage was nearly as negative in most other outlets.Compare to Hillary s coverage:To be sure, changes in journalism are not the only reason that campaigns have become more negative. The party polarization that has seeped into American politics during the past three decades has been accompanied by rising levels of partisan attack. But to claim that party polarization explains the media s negative bent is to ignore the fact that the press s negativity is not confined to party politics. There s barely an aspect of public life that is not subject to intense criticism.A healthy dose of negativity is unquestionably a good thing. There s a lot of political puffery, ineptitude, and manipulation that needs to be exposed, and journalists would be shirking their duty if they failed to expose it. Yet an incessant stream of criticism has a corrosive effect. It needlessly erodes trust in political leaders and institutions and undermines confidence in government and policy.Negative news has partisan consequences. Given that journalists bash both sides, it might be thought the impact would be neutral. It s not. For one thing, indiscriminate criticism has the effect of blurring important distinctions. Were the allegations surrounding Clinton of the same order of magnitude as those surrounding Trump? It s a question that journalists made no serious effort to answer during the 2016 campaign. They reported all the ugly stuff they could find, and left it to the voters to decide what to make of it. Large numbers of voters concluded that the candidates  indiscretions were equally disqualifying and made their choice, not on the candidates  fitness for office, but on less tangible criteria in some cases out of a belief that wildly unrealistic promises could actually be kept.For entire story and study: Harvard Kennedy School Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy",politics,"Dec 16, 2016",6807
 Tea Party Superstar Gets WRECKED After Obama ‘N****r’ Tweet,"Tea Party darling and deadbeat dad extraordinaire Joe Walsh managed to be douchier than is typical on Sunday when he attacked Michael Che for saying something mean about Donald Trump.It may seem nonsensical that the  fuck your feelings  crowd gets sad every time someone says something to  trigger  them, but Walsh apparently needs a safe space after SNL s Michael Che called Donald Trump a  cracker  (among other things).Like all conservatives at some point in their lives, Walsh became  economically disenfranchised  (the media s term for racism among Trump voters) enough upon hearing Trump described as a  cracker  (the name of an all-white minor league baseball team in Atlanta, Georgia in the early parts of last century) to bust out the  n*gger  word.Naturally, The People were not amused:You thinking there is any equivalence between those two words demonstrates how thoroughly out of touch you are.  bob clendenin (@bobclendenin) October 1, 2017Why do white conservatives want to say that word so bad?

CHICAGO DELI OWNER Says He Was Relieved To Hear Las Vegas Massacre Happened At Country Music Festival: “White people shooting white people isn’t terror … it’s community outreach”,"Chicago Tribune   Just weeks after stoking controversy by using Nazi imagery on his Jewish deli s Facebook page, the co-owner of Max s Deli in Highland Park again has ignited outrage   this time with a tweet he fired off in response to the Las Vegas shootings. Soon as I heard it was country music, I felt relief. White people shooting white people isn t terror   it s community outreach. #LasVegas,  the tweet read.Morelli attempted to apologize for his remark:Morelli, who described himself as politically  lost  with no allegiances, said his tweet about the deaths was thoughtless. It was a dumb joke and it didn t work. I own it. It was stupid,  Morelli said. It was seven in the morning and I was stressed out and freaked out by the shooting,  he added.  I was trying to participate, and all I did was put my foot in my mouth. But is he really sorry, or is he only doing damage control?  Only one month ago, Morelli posted this vile image on Max s Deli s Facebook page. Although Morelli admitted that after his post, his family, who were affected by his outrageous post, are  done  with him. Chicago Tribune   Highland Park deli is facing backlash over a Facebook post that includes a cartoon drawing of a man wearing a Nazi armband, giving a stiff-armed salute and donning a T-shirt reading,  I m with Alt-Right. Greg Morelli, who owns Max s Deli with his brother, posted the image last week. Morelli frequently posts the deli s menu along with cartoon drawings he creates to the restaurant s Facebook page. He said the recent events in Charlottesville inspired him to use the page to make a strong political statement. I have a Jewish deli, I am a Jewish man,  Morelli said.

Morelli, 49, said the image was of an alt-right member who has hair evocative of President Donald Trump, but was not meant to be a depiction of the president himself.The full post and its related image are still on the deli s Facebook page.He said the deli was inundated with calls on Thursday as the post began to spread on Facebook and through news stories. Callers have been criticizing the post s imagery and its political message, he said.The effect of the post on his family has been difficult and Morelli says they are  done with him. When you create a storm, everyone that loves you just wants you to take the easy path,  he said.In a Facebook post on the restaurant s page Thursday evening, Morelli did not back down from the discussion the initial image provoked. I do not regret getting involved. I do not regret speaking out,  he wrote.  I do not regret assigning symbolism to hatred. I do not regret being trashed on Facebook. That said, it hurt. When asked about the specific use of Nazi imagery in the post and the reaction to not just his intended message, but the image itself, Morelli said the symbolism was a necessary point to make. We have to use the imagery and assign it to the groups so we know how to react,  Morelli said.  I happen to find satire very powerful. ",left-news,"Oct 5, 2017",3083
 Trump Signs Huge Saudi Arms Deal,"Over the weekend, President Trump signed a massive $109 billion deal selling weapons to the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which has been recently accused of war crimes in Yemen. The arms agreement, negotiated by his son-in-law Jared Kushner, is the biggest of its kind in US history. It s the first stage of a $350 billion commitment over 10 years, which will supply Saudi Arabia with some of America s most advanced and destructive weapons systems. The terms of the deal cover everything from fighter jets to tanks, with a special focus on America s cutting edge THAAD  missile shield.  THAAD has been in the news recently as Trump insisted that South Korea owed America $1 billion for deploying the system at the North Korean border.SAUDI KING: Come overTRUMP: I can't, I said you guys did 9/11SAUDI KING: We'll buy $110 billion in weaponsTRUMP: pic.twitter.com/FkZq6XnFdB  Ken Klippenstein (@kenklippenstein) May 20, 2017Trump reportedly negotiated a massive discount on cutting-edge fighter jets in order to get Saudi Arabia to sign on to the agreement. hmmm, I don't see how selling $200 billion in advanced weapons to an army that absolutely cannot fight can go badly  Inventor of Leftism (@ByYourLogic) May 19, 2017Also part of the arms sale are some of the world s most advanced stealth attack ships, which were designed and built as part of America s ongoing effort to revamp the Navy.Aside from the obvious hypocrisy of arming the Saudis, who regularly commit human rights abuses against women, racial minorities, and homosexuals living in the country, the deal has come under fire for Saudi Arabia s recent war crimes in Yemen.Trump taking action to facilitate more Saudi war crimes in Yemen. https://t.co/ZUgHKmucev pic.twitter.com/svNtem4njf  Matthew Yglesias (@mattyglesias) May 20, 2017One of the largest abuses that Saudi Arabia is accused of in Yemen are crimes against children.

 Bombshell Report Shows GOP Presidential Campaign A Complete DISASTER In Multiple States,"Presidential elections are won by well-prepared, well organized multimillion dollar efforts that are executed at the state level. Some of the best models of this have been President Bush s campaign in 2004 and President Obama s campaigns in 2008 and 2012. What needs to be done and how it should be done are known by seasoned campaign operatives and candidates who put the people in place to make it happen.Donald Trump s presidential campaign, and the Republican Party s planning to help his campaign in multiple states that are key to winning, are a complete disaster with only four months to go until the election, according to a new report from the Associated Press.With early voting beginning in less than three months in some states, the review reveals that the national GOP has delivered only a fraction of the ground forces detailed in discussions with state leaders earlier in the year. And that is leaving anxious local officials waiting for reinforcements to keep pace with Democrat Hillary Clinton in the states that matter most in 2016.The Republican Party s massive failure gets even worse when you zoom in to swing states, as the Associated Press has:Some examples of Republican shortfalls: Ohio Republicans thought they were going to see 220 paid staffers by May; in reality there are about 50. Plans for Pennsylvania called for 190 paid staffers; there are about 60. Iowa s planned ground force of 66 by May actually numbers between 25 and 30. In Colorado, recent staff departures have left about two dozen employees, far short of the 80 that were to have been in place.AP even found that Trump s headquarters in Florida, one of the most important states in the fight for the electoral college, was closed and its voice mailbox full. Florida has 29 electoral votes and in 2012 was decided by a margin of 0.87 percent   on the ground organizing is key to winning it.These failures at the state organizing level don t even take into account the massive disparity in campaign advertising between Clinton and Trump. While she has been pumping out ads in important states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, Colorado, and New Mexico along with super PACs that support her, Trump hasn t been advertising at all. In 2012, Mitt Romney s campaign was outspent by President Obama, but he was actually spending money   Trump isn t spending on much, besides many of his own entities who showed up as campaign vendors.Republicans, especially in 2012, derided President Obama s background as a community organizer, but they could do with one right now to organize for their candidate in the communities he needs in order to have a chance at winning. That doesn t seem to be happening.Featured image via Flickr",News,"July 11, 2016",2710
FORMER NFL PLAYER: UCLA Player’s Dad Said ‘Dumbest Thing’ [Video],"Former NFL player Shannon Sharpe on Tuesday called LaVar Ball s complaints directed at President Donald Trump the  dumbest thing  he could have said. Sharpe is usually as anti-Trump as they come but is just smart enough to understand that it s idiotic to diss the president. Sharpe makes some dumb comments during the rant about LaVar Ball but it s pretty big that he is supportive of President Trump:Sharpe appeared to take Trump s side in the feud and said the president s involvement in China  didn t hurt the situation. I can assure you President Trump mentioning [the detainment] to the Chinese President didn t hurt his situation. If he [LaVar Ball] felt this strongly, why didn t the hell he say that while they were over there? This is when he should have been vocal.  Sharpe said.Sharpe also asked why, if Trump didn t help the situation, why did all three players personally thank him? Why did all three of those guys get up there and say thank President Trump, personally? Thank the American government, personally?  Sharpe inquired.  I didn t hear one of them mention LaVar Ball s name. I did hear three  President Trumps  and three  American government.  Now they get back on American soil, he [LaVar Ball] wants to pound his chest. I see why President Trump used the word  ungrateful,'  he added.Later in the segment, Sharpe said Trump wouldn t have had to say anything about LiAngelo Ball if he hadn t attempted to steal. President Trump would have said nothing about the boy. If your son would have had kept his sticky ass fingers in his pockets, and not take peoples  stuff in China, we wouldn t even be having this conversation,  Sharpe said, directing his comments to LaVar Ball.In the past, Sharpe has criticized Trump, especially over the president s comments about player protests in the NFL.

 WATCH: Trump’s Treasury Sec. Steve Mnuchin Says NFL Players Have No Right To Free Speech,"Donald Trump is clearly violating the free speech rights of NFL players, and his weaselly Treasury Secretary supports it.As we all know, Trump has been waging a war against the NFL since calling quarterback Colin Kaepernick a  son of a bitch  on Friday night and demanding that NFL team owners fire players who kneel during the national anthem. On Saturday night, and into Sunday morning, Trump lashed out at the NFL in a tirade that made it clear that Trump opposes free speech and the Constitution that protects it.If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL,or other leagues, he or she should not be allowed to disrespect .  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 23, 2017 our Great American Flag (or Country) and should stand for the National Anthem. If not, YOU RE FIRED. Find something else to do!  Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 23, 2017If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag & Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2017 NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes, but many stay away because they love our country. League should back U.S.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2017That s right. Trump accused an American business of being anti-American for not firing players who kneel during the anthem in protest of police brutality and racial injustice. In short, Trump ordered the NFL to fire players who exercise their freedom of speech and expression. That means the government is now actively trying to force private institutions to silence and punish free speech.And Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin agreed with what Trump is doing, and even went full hypocrite by defending Trump s vile language. The owners should have a rule that players should have to stand and have respect for the national anthem,  Mnuchin told ABC host Martha Raddatz.  This isn t about Democrats, this isn t about Republicans, it s not about race, it s not about free speech. They can do free speech on their own time. The Constitution protects freedom of speech. This is something that Mnuchin clearly does not understand, which should automatically disqualify him from being in government.When asked about Trump s language, Mnuchin argued that  the president can use whatever language he wants to use.  In other words, white racists like Trump have freedom of speech, but black NFL players do not.Mnuchin then butchered the First Amendment even further by claiming that NFL players only  have the right to have the First Amendment off the field.  And that s complete bullshit. Clearly, Mnuchin failed basic civics in school.Here s the video via YouTube.The government, including the president, can t order a business to violate the free speech rights of their employees. Donald Trump owes an apology to the players whom he offended with his outrageously divisive remarks. No one can be forced to stand for the national anthem, just as no child can be forced to stand and recite the Pledge of Allegiance. It s unconstitutional.Featured image via video screen capture ",News,"September 24, 2017",3341
 Cruz Campaign Donates Water To Flint–But Only To People Who Qualify For Their ‘Generosity’,"Ted Cruz is fast approaching Donald Trump as the most hated man in America. As GOP insiders and long-time public figures denounce Cruz as someone nobody in congress would work with, he continues to take his campaign in directions that guarantee that Democrats and Independents will despise him even more. Apparently, Cruz thinks he can get elected with the votes of the extreme-right only, which is where his platform is and will always be directed.In what may be the worst case of discrimination and idiocy ever by a presidential campaign, Ted Cruz 2016 donated an undisclosed amount of bottled water to residents of Flint, restricting their  generosity  to people with the  right  frame of mind. Cruz s campaign staff took to the streets to get much-needed water to those working and visiting the fraudulent  pregnancy crisis centers  that dupe women into believing they re going to receive medical advice and treatment but are instead cornered and fed anti-abortion rhetoric and religious indoctrination.Cruz s Michigan state campaign director, Wendy Lynn Day, announced in a Facebook post begging for donations that the campaign had worked with anti-abortion group Flint Right to Life to coordinate this absolutely idiotic and ridiculously ignorant plan.  The water is for  expecting moms and moms of little ones. Cruz state director @WendyLynnDay: Donating water to #Flint babies both supports the city and shows ""the pro-life values of Senator Cruz.""  Chad Livengood (@ChadLivengood) January 20, 2016The  pro-life values  of Senator Cruz apparently include denying children who have already been exposed to massive amounts of lead from Republican incompetence water they so desperately need because their parents aren t currently seeking anti-choice counseling from a place where zealots wear lab coats to make people think they re physicians.The malfunctioning moral platitudes of these people are astounding. While most of the GOP field feigns ignorance to an issue they want nothing to do with, Cruz 2016 has taken a proactive role in alienating an entire city in the middle of a crisis unless they conform to the beliefs of Ted Cruz. Pro-life  Ted Cruz, who thinks carpet bombing whole villages full of innocent people is OK as long as you kill some terrorists along the way, hasn t personally commented on the issue, but his campaign works directly on his behalf.Certainly the several people who work at these madhouses are appreciative of the clean water donations while tens of thousands of others line up to receive actual charity from people who care about the already born.Featured image via tedcruz.org, altered",News,"January 22, 2016",2628

The court s Establishment Clause analysis is fundamentally flawed and ignores the separation of powers. Worst of all, it puts our national security at risk.As the Supreme Court has rightly held, the United States Constitution is  not a suicide pact. As I explained earlier this week when we filed our amicus brief with the court in this case, the order in no way violates the Establishment Clause:First, the Executive Order (EO) does not even address religion, whatsoever. Second, the order has a secular purpose: our national security. As we explained: The EO, on its face, serves secular purposes, and no amount of rehashing of miscellaneous campaign trail commentary can change that. . . . [T]he mere suggestion of a possible religious or anti-religious motive, mined from past comments of a political candidate or his supporters, and intermixed with various secular purposes, is not enough to doom government action (along with all subsequent attempts to address the same subject matter).  [A]ll that Lemon requires  is that government action have  a secular purpose,  not that its purpose be  exclusively secular,  and a policy is invalid under this test only if it  was motivated wholly by religious considerations.  Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U.S. 668, 680-81 & n.6 (1984) (emphasis added). The order singles out no religion for favor or disfavor. To conclude otherwise is unreasonable, and absurd. The six countries whose nationals are impacted by the pause were countries identified by President Obama and Congress as countries of particular concern. Policy disagreements, hurt feelings, and political agendas are not enough to support an Establishment Clause claim. The court s flawed order will invariably be appealed, and we will be ready to file crucial amicus briefs once again in federal appeals court.Read more: aclj",Government News,"Mar 16, 2017",2917

HILARIOUS! Look Who LIBERAL Middlebury Professor Is Blaming After She Was Sent To Hospital By Angry Mob Of Leftist Students,"Two weeks ago at Middlebury College, Charles Murray needed a safe space   literally.In a significant escalation of the campus speech wars, protesters hooted down the conservative scholar in a lecture hall and then roughed up a Middlebury faculty member escorting him to a car.The Middlebury administration commendably tried to do the right thing and stand by Murray s right to be heard, but was overwhelmed by a yowling mob with all the manners and intellectual openness of a gang of British soccer hooligans.The students who brought in Charles Murray framed the evening as  an invitation to argue,  and in that spirit asked Professor Allison Stanger, a Democrat in good standing, to serve as Murray s interlocutor. When chanting students commandeered the lecture hall, Stanger and Murray repaired to another room for a livestreamed discussion.Protesters found the room and pounded on the windows and pulled fire alarms. When Murray and Stanger exited at the end of the livestream and headed for their getaway car, protesters assailed them. They shoved and grabbed Stanger, who was shaken up and later went to the hospital, and pounded on the car and tried to obstruct it. She was recently diagnosed with a concussion that she suffered during the liberal beating by Middlebury students.Stanger wrote afterward that she  feared for my life. And for what offense? Talking to someone who thinks differently than the average Middleburg faculty member or student.Allison Stanger invited Charles Murray, famous for The Bell Curve, to speak at the school. Students were so outraged Murray had to flee for his life, and Stanger got beaten up. Her response?It s Trump s fault!During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, student Red Guards forced professors to make self-confessions. This situation was clearly different, however, as most of the students were not Chinese.Stanger is smart. She doesn t have to deal with Donald Trump at her school, but she does have to deal with her fellow leftist faculty members and leftist students. She s trying to make kissy-kissy with them so they don t smack her in the head again.If I were in her position, I d probably do the same thing. On the other hand, Vermont is a concealed carry state, so maybe there could be another option when faced with a life-threatening leftist mob.Exit question:1) When someone goes to an emergency room with throbbing head pains and a hardcore leftist worldview, how can an E.R. doctor determine whether the patient has a head injury or simply a very rigid ideological point of view?   American ThinkerSo in summary, the leftist professor who s made it her mission to indoctrinate Middlebury students, is now blaming President Trump because those same students she encouraged to think and behave like leftists, behaved in a way that is compatible with how leftists behave.  Using  violence and threatening behavior to get your way and drown out the opposing voices is nothing new for leftists, they ve just taken it a significant notch since Obama took office 8 years ago.

 Bombshell Reports Confirm What We Already Believed About MSNBC’s Joe And Mika (DETAILS),"For the last ten years, Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski have been co-hosts on MSNBC s Morning Joe. They have often seemed a little too chummy, and it has long been speculated that the two were an item. However, both were also married to other people. Scarborough got divorced from his wife in 2013, and Brzezinki was officially free in 2016. To that end, it seems that now that we are in 2017, a respectable enough amount of time has passed to where they can go ahead and confirm the public s belief that they were more than co-hosts.It is now being reported that the two are not only an item, but are actually engaged to be married. This comes after a bizarre round of  congratulations  on the Thursday edition of the show. Of course, the duo s guests said the congratulatory sentiments were about  ratings,  but now we know that it was about upcoming nuptials. The news comes courtesy of the New York Post s Emily Smith, who writes: We re told Scarborough, 54, got down on one knee and proposed at the scenic Bar Bellini at the Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc in Antibes, which has a breathtaking moonlit outdoor terrace overlooking the Mediterranean Sea. Now, think what you want of Mika and Joe   I personally have mixed feelings and a bit of a love/hate relationship with Morning Joe   but at least they are finally being honest with the public and their fans. It could be just a bit scandalous, because if they are engaged so soon after Mika s divorce, obviously there was an affair happening while either one or both of them were still married.Of course, these days scandalous affairs are pretty routine for celebrities, though they are supposedly news people   or, at the very least, pundits   so who knows how the network will handle it.There have been no public statements on the announcement from Joe, Mika, or MSNBC as of this writing.Featured image via Frederick M.

 Trump Makes New Racist Attack On Judge Exposing Trump University (VIDEO),"Donald Trump is very upset at the judge overseeing the ongoing lawsuit in which the allegation is being made that his Trump University was nothing more than a sophisticated scam designed to separate regular Americans from their hard earned money. Despite the Republican nominee s attempts to detract attention away from the case, new revelations keep coming out that show the reality TV star s involvement in unsavory business practices.So Trump has been lashing out at the judge, and in explicitly racist terms. Trump went there once again in an interview with the Wall Street Journal.Donald Trump is claiming that a judge with Mexican heritage who is overseeing a lawsuit against Trump University has an  inherent conflict of interest  given the presumptive GOP nominee s rhetoric on immigration.[ ] I m building a wall. It s an inherent conflict of interest,  Trump told the Journal.So what Trump is saying is that since he is  building a wall  between the United States and Mexico, he can t be subject to judicial oversight from an American citizen with Mexican heritage.CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin accurately debunked the insanity of Trump s allegation, noting that: The ethnicity of the judge is not in it of itself a grounds for recusal, ever. And that is a claim that Trump   under the First Amendment   is certainly allowed to make, but it is completely wrong under the law. Trump is angry because the documents exposed by the Trump University suit (and ongoing fraud case from the New York state attorney general) show that Trump University sales people were told to target vulnerable customers in order to pressure them to buy expensive and worthless real estate training. Trump University documents said that struggling parents should be targeted, as should people who clearly could not afford the training who were pressured to increase their lines of credit using high pressure boiler room tactics.In response to the Trump University revelations, Hillary Clinton called Trump a  fraud,  and now he continues to lash out in a highly racist way, which has been the cornerstone of his presidential campaign.Featured image via YouTube",News,"June 3, 2016",2156
 Another Win For The NRA: Court Rules That Cities Can’t Protect Themselves From Gun Violence,"If you ve ever thought our government is completely run by the National Rifle Association, your mind won t be changed by this article.A federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled on Monday that any laws that cities or states pass to protect their citizens from gun violence are unconstitutional.The case was about three business partners in Alameda, California, who wanted to open a gun store, but they were denied a zoning permit. The court ruled in the partners  favor, saying that the right to bear arms meant the right to buy arms. If  the right of the people to keep and bear arms  is to have any force, the people must have a right to acquire the very firearms they are entitled to keep and to bear,  wrote Judge Diarmuid F. O Scannlain (a Reagan appointee) for the 2-1 majority, quoting the Second Amendment.  One cannot truly enjoy a constitutionally protected right when the state is permitted to snuff out the means by which he exercises it. All of this makes sense until you realize that cities and states can regulate virtually anything else that s sold. If a city chooses not to allow a bar or a massage parlor, that s their right. It should also be the right of a city to help mitigate crime, and if fewer guns do that, they can ban the sale of guns.Unlike gun manufacturers, though, massage parlors and bars don t have massive lobbying arms to control their every move. These graphs are a couple years old, but little has changed. Most of the NRA s bribery money goes straight into the pockets of Congressmen   236 of them Republican and 25 Democrats.You can bet that it was the NRA who propelled this case to a higher court in the first place.Judge Barry G. Silverman, named to the bench by President Bill Clinton, wrote in dissent, describing the case as  a mundane zoning dispute dressed up as a Second Amendment challenge. Conspicuously missing from this lawsuit is any honest-to-God resident of Alameda County complaining that he or she cannot lawfully buy a gun nearby,  Judge Silverman wrote.The most ridiculous part of this case is that the ordinance that caused the gun store to be turned away doesn t ban gun stores. It simply says they cannot be less than 500 feet from a residence. They wanted to build it 446 feet away.What this means is that as much as Republicans claim to value property rights (and life), when it comes to guns, there are no property rights. If you don t drool over the thought of guns, your right to keep your children away from guns is non-existent because in the United States, it s increasingly becoming guns before people.Featured image by Ethan Miller at Getty Images.",News,"May 17, 2016",2624

" Fox Host Goes Rogue, Shreds Trump’s ‘Cowardly And Dangerous’ Charlottesville Remarks (VIDEO)","It s a bad day for Donald Trump when even the most conservative, racist media networks are calling him out for his failure to denounce the white supremacists responsible for the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia.On Monday, Fox host Eboni Williams went on Fox News Specialists and ripped Trump a new one for his disappointing, weak response to the Charlottesville tragedy. While many conservatives have stated that Trump s first pathetic response on Saturday was more than enough, many have gone after Trump and called for him to publicly denounce white supremacy in a follow-up statement.

I was legitimately unsure, but absent more conclusive evidence, I was willing to give you the benefit of the doubt. I can no longer do that, Mr. President. No more benefit, all doubt. Williams also called Trump out for his statement in which he  very intentionally chose to be ambiguous and to equivocate : President Trump, I do not know your heart. But what I do know for sure is that you ve clearly done the math, and you ve decided that your portion of the base that is absolutely racist is so significant, so valuable that you hesitate, even in the face of blatant, flagrant hatred to risk turning them off and thereby crippling your political stronghold. While you personally might not be a racist, President Trump, what you are is all too happy to reap the benefits of their support. Williams warned Trump that  this moment is on you , making sure that Trump knew he missed a major opportunity to prove his critics wrong. Instead, he only solidified everyone s belief that he s a racist piece of sh*t. You can watch Williams trash Trump below:Featured image via Mario Tama  / Getty Images",News,"August 14, 2017",2118
UH OH! BILL CLINTON Unloads On Obama! [Video]," Unlike when I was president, a lot of things are coming apart around the world now.    Bill ClintonIt seems like the chummy feelings between the Clintons and Obama are on the rocks. In the past couple of weeks Chelsea Clinton pulled out a couple zingers to jab Obama. Today, Bill clinton jumped into the mix with some brutal criticisms of the Obama years:Former President Bill Clinton unloaded on the Obama administration and Black Lives Matter protesters during a campaign event Thursday for his wife in Pennsylvania.Clinton took a veiled jab at Obama s handling of world affairs, saying,  Unlike when I was president, a lot of things are coming apart around the world now. We like to just think about our economic issues, but you have to worry about a collapse in Europe dragging back the American economy. You have to worry about the largest number of refugees since World War II. And all this stuff comes home.  Clinton told listeners at Spokane Falls Community College that if they believed the U.S. had  finally come to the point where we could put the awful legacy of the last eight years behind us and the seven years before that where we were practicing trickle-down economics and no regulation in Washington, then you should vote for [Hillary].

"THE GEORGE COSTANZA OF CNN Destroyed On His Own Show: “We have a one-party system, and the media as the other party.” [Video]","CNN Host Brian Stelter was destroyed by former NY Observer Editor Ken Kurson today on Stelter s own show! This was truly epic! Stelter calmly laid out a damning indictment of the mainstream media in the age of Trump Beautiful!Host Stelter pushed back trying to make the claim that the attacks on Trump are just harmless  opinion We all know and have watched the BRUTAL and BITTER editorializing from CNN and MSNBC. It s clearly more than that.HERE S A BIT OF THE TRANSCRIPT FROM THE KURSON/STELTER EXCHANGE:KEN KURSON: So the idea here is that the media has become the opposition to Trump. Just listening to the intro to this show, listening to Fareed s show before it, it s no longer that the Republican point of view holds forth, and the Democrats hold them accountable, and the media covers it. It s that the president and the White House put forth their point of view, the media argues with them, and the Democrats have become totally irrelevant to that discussion. It s a stunning thing to watch unfold during this presidency.BRIAN STELTER: About the irrelevancy of the Democratic party?KURSON: Totally! And the way the press has assigned itself the chore of undoing the results of this election, which they simply don t accept. And I think the shame of it is, we no longer have even a two-party system, which many think is too few. We have a one-party system, and the media as the other party.KURSON: During these breaks, when I watch you go on Twitter. The way journalists reward each other for stabbing and needling there s a new system of reward that is out there for journalists that has very little to do with policy and very little to do with advancing this country.STELTER: Where do you go from that to, the media is the opposition.KURSON: Because when I look at the tone, and the way these attacks are launched, and I ve cited a couple of examples for you, or the way that whenever there s a need for the appearance of balance, NPR will hire some conservative who hates the president. Or the New York Times will go get Bret Stephens, whose main contribution is that he hates the president.Whenever there s the need for the appearance of fairness, there s no real effort to   where are the pro-Trump journalists in the mainstream media? They don t exist! Because the entire mainstream media is against Trump. And that I think is not just bad for American policy. I think it s bad for journalism.STELTER: I think a lot of journalists are against lying, are against deceit. That s where we are right now.KURSON: I m against lying and deceit. I think the function of the journalist to hold the administration accountable is a critical function enshrined in our Bill of Rights. But when you have a system where the most outrageous attack is what s rewarded with likes on Facebook and followings on Twitter, you re setting yourself up.STELTER: Those are opinion columns! Those are opinion columns!KURSON: No, they re not just opinion columns. It s reporters. And they audition for each other, and they audition for popularity.Kurson couldn t be more right! Have you noticed that since the daily White House press briefings are not televised that the questions and tone from reporters has gotten so much calmer and less dramatic? Playing for the cameras to get that gotcha moment has disappeared so the reporters are focused and civil.Wouldn t it be great if the news would return to the facts?Read more: Legal Insurrection",politics,"Jul 18, 2017",3430

 Fox News: Trump Is The One To Blame for White House ‘Disarray’ (VIDEO),"President Donald Trump likes to call most of the press  fake  so when the White House is called disorganized or unprofessional, it is easy for him to discount the criticism. FOX News, however, is one of his favorite outlets.This week it is hard to call the White House anything but a hot mess. The communications office, for instance, does not seem to have any idea of what s going on. But even Chris Wallace, the host of FOX News Sunday, is saying any problems in the White House communications office should be laid at the feet of the president.Wallace said,  One of the problems has been the disarray at the White House communications shop. The president has been blaming that on them, but the fact is it should be blamed on him, because he didn t seem to trust them enough to give them advanced notice. There have been reports that despite not having given his staff the information they needed to develop a coherent and comprehensive strategy, Trump was up watching the television coverage of Comey s firing, yelling at the set and blaming the people around him for not defending the decision.,Wallace said that he has been trying to book a White House spokesperson all week to go on his Sunday show and has had no success. He said,  They still haven t given us anybody. We can t even reach anybody   they re not available, they re not answering the phone.

US Thanksgiving Guide: How to Celebrate a Sordid and Genocidal History," Table set for thanksgiving in Siem Reap. (Photo: Andre Vltchek)Andre Vltchek NEOA table was set up for two, an advertisement table, a table with a photo of a giant turkey, two elegant plates, and a U.S. flag sticking out into the air. Thanksgiving at Angkor Royal Cafe , a flier read. And:  23rd November  Join us for a traditional Thanksgiving Feast .This was at one of the international hotels in Siem Reap, a Cambodian city near the world architectural treasures of Angkor Wat and the ancient Khmer capital, Angkor Thom.The same day I read an email sent to me from the United States, by my Native American friends, with a link to an essay published by MPN News, called  Thanksgiving Guide: How to Celebrate a Sordid History . It began with a summary: While millions of Americans prepare this week to get into the holiday spirit, beginning with Thanksgiving, how many are prepared to view the day through an accurate lens? While to many Americans the holiday serves as a reminder to give thanks, it is seen as a day of mourning by countless of others. The truth is: European migrants brutally murdered Native Americans, stole their land, and continue to do so today . The day became an official day of festivities in 1637, to celebrate the massacre of over 700 people from the Pequot Tribe.In a hotel, I approached a cheerful French food and beverage manager and asked him whether he was aware of what he was suggesting should be celebrated in one of his restaurants? Oh I know I know,  he replied, laughing.  It is a little bit controversial, isn t it? Bit controversial?  I wondered.  It appears more like you are inviting people to celebrate genocide, a holocaust, with free flowing wine and a giant turkey. I am trying to see things positively,  he continued grinning at me. Then he summarized:  So I guess you won t be joining us tonight? What a pity What a pity,  I thought,  what a pity.  I won t get to eat that famous American pie tonight and turkey and who knows what else, just because I am not eager at all to celebrate the massacres and land grabs perpetrated by the Empire.The manager couldn t help asking:  Where are you from? I knew he would ask. No European would say what I was saying. I m Russian,  I replied. Oh I see,  he gave me that  I should have guessed smile . Russian-American,  I added.I m convinced that the French manager has been sincerely oblivious about what I was stating. He is supposed to be oblivious. There are, after all,  our genocides , and  the genocides of the others .  Our genocides , those that we triggered or committed, should never be discussed. Or more precisely, it is extremely impolite to discuss them. Most of the people don t even know about them, including many of the victims. On the other hand, the genocides committed by the others, particularly by adversaries of the West, are widely discussed, publicized, analyzed, inflated and very often even fabricated (All this described in detail in my 840-page book  Exposing Lies Of The Empire ).Cambodia is the textbook case of the latter. Here, several decades ago, the U.S. and its allies first supported the hopelessly corrupt and brutal government in Phnom Penh, while triggering a monstrous carpet-bombing campaign of the Cambodian countryside, mainly near the border with Vietnam. This was supposed to prevent the country from  going Communist , or at least  Ho Chi Minh style Communist . Hundreds of thousands of villagers were murdered by the bombing. Millions were forced to hit the road, leaving their dwellings, as the countryside was converted into a giant minefield, covered by unexploded ordnance.Further hundreds of thousands died from starvation and diseases. Furious, mad from suffering, the people of Cambodia rose against the collaborators with the West in Phnom Penh. Pol Pot and his Khmer Rouge took the capital virtually unopposed. Recently, deep in the jungle, I spoke to the former Pol Pot s personal guards. I asked them point-blank whether they knew anything about Communism.  Nothing at all,  I was told.  The U.S. was murdering our families, for no reason. Corrupt elites were selling the country to the West. We were all outraged, and ready for revenge. We would follow anybody calling for revenge.  However, the West is passing the events, to this day, as a  Communist genocide .Rwanda is yet another  case  of a twisted narrative. I made an entire full-length documentary film   Rwanda Gambit   on the subject. There, the West turned the history upside down, reducing the entire tragedy into a primitive and easy-to-digest narrative of bad Hutus killing good Tutsis. Yet even the former U.S. ambassador Robert Flatten told me that his country groomed, armed and supported the deadly RPF, mainly Tutsi army, which had been, before 1994, raiding the Rwandan countryside from neighboring Uganda, burning villages and killing civilians.While a former Australian lawyer and U.N. investigator, Michael Hourigan, supplied me with information about the downing of the plane, which, in April 1994, killed both the Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana and Burundian President Cyprien Ntaryamira, while on the final approach to Kigali airport. The orders to shoot down the plane were given by the RPF leader Paul Kagame, who was in turn sponsored by the West. This event triggered the terrible bloodletting on 1994. The next year, in 1995, the Rwandan army entered the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and participated in the killing of at least 9 million people, mainly civilians, on behalf of Western governments and multi-national companies, making it the worst crime against humanity in recent history.In fact, almost all the major genocides committed by the West or its allies in modern history, are  silent ones , including those in Iraq, Syria, Iran, West Papua, East Timor, DRC, Indonesia, Afghanistan, Angola, and dozens of other unfortunate places all over the world.The gruesome genocides committed by the West all over the world, during the last 2,000 but especially during the last 500 years, are never defined as such; never as  genocides . Throughout history, European countries have been destroying, systematically, most of the cultures on all continents of the Planet, enslaving virtually all the non-white nations, plundering and looting its colonies (read: almost all the non-white nations of the world), while exterminating hundreds of millions of men, women and children. The death toll has been rising, accumulating, to near 1 billion, according to the testimony of one of my friends, a senior U.N. statistician.I will return to the  Cambodian story  soon, on the pages of this magazine. And I will be returning, again and again, to the genocides committed by Europe and North America, virtually everywhere. Unless the history is understood and acknowledged, the world has no future, and there can be no solutions to the terrible problems that our humanity is facing.But for now, let me conclude this brief essay by saying that I did not participate in the consumption of turkey and American pies on Thanksgiving holiday, in the Cambodian city of Seam Reap.My thoughts went to those 700 people from the Pequot Tribe who rebelled, stood firm and died for freedom, almost 400 years ago. These were some of the first fighters against Western imperialism. These were the  Americans  that I admire, this is America that had been terribly damaged but not yet completely destroyed. No overly sugary, sentimental and empty words could fully choke its essence, as no gluttony and food orgies could ever fully silence the screams of the pain of those who died in the hands of the European invaders, during and after the conquest of what has been so cynically christened as the  New World .***Andre Vltchek is a philosopher, novelist, filmmaker and investigative journalist.

Hey Packers and Bears: We Don’t Lock Arms for the National Anthem! [Video],"Last night s game between the Bears and Packers is usually a fun-filled event that s become a huge tradition for football fans everywhere. Last night was no exception!The stadium was filled with fans who chanted USA, USA! The fans were ready to see hand over heart during the national anthem but got something very disappointing instead. The players from both teams tried to split the difference and stand for the anthem while locking arms. Outraged fans considered it just as much a protest as taking a knee, the gesture made famous by former San Francisco 49ers player Colin Kaepernick who kicked off the protest last year. I am so ashamed of and appalled by the ignorance of any NFL player who would dare disgrace our Stars and Stripes or the memory of hundreds of thousands of fallen U.S. heroes who paid with their lives so that we may live free,  Packers shareholder and 20-year U.S. Air Force veteran Steven Tiefenthaler told the Green Bay Press-Gazette.Packers fans are in a unique position to have their voices heard because unlike the privately owned 31 other NFL teams, theirs is divvied up among over 360,000 fans who own over 5 million shares of the franchise. The division mirrored the stand-off between NFL players and President Trump who last week called for any athlete who kneels during the anthem to be fired.Read more: Daily Mail",politics,"Sep 29, 2017",1349
 Even Trey Gowdy Thinks Trump’s Wiretap Conspiracy Is Crazy,"Donald Trump is playing a dangerous game by falsely accusing his predecessor of wiretapping his phone lines before the election. Most people realize when Trump seems unhinged in his Twitter timeline, it s usually to distract the public from what is really going on, such as his scandalous ties to Russia and his new travel ban which remarkably resembles his old travel ban. Republicans and Democrats are both left scratching their heads over Trump s accusations.Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy (S.C.), who spent two years investigating Hillary Clinton over the attacks in Benghazi, said Monday he s seen no evidence to support Trump s claim that former President Obama wiretapped his office during the presidential campaign. I don t think the FBI is the Obama team, and I don t think the men and women who are career prosecutors at [the Department of Justice] belong to any team other than a blindfolded woman holding a pair of scales,  Gowdy told Politico. We have the tools to keep us safe and it s prudent for those tools to be used lawfully and appropriately,  Gowdy continued.  If they re not used lawfully and appropriately, there s a paper trail and we ll be able to find it out. Gowdy continued to say that it was  hard to cross-examine tweets  and any information regarding a FISA warrant used against Trump would be available to the Trump administration.By the way, if a FISA warrant was issued, that would have to be allowed by a judge. Meaning, in that instance, there would be some sort of evidence against Trump, so much so as to wiretap his phones or at least any calls to and or from Russia. The Obama team is no longer in charge,  Gowdy added.  So any information the current Department of Justice has that suggests the previous Department of Justice acted inappropriately, they are welcome to release it. But there is no evidence to release. A sitting president cannot issue a wiretap. That s not how presidenting works, k? There is a process to go through first.Even Jason Chaffetz said today that there is no evidence to back up Trump s claim. Still yet, Chaffetz is willing to investigate Trump s claim while refusing to launch a probe into the alleged president s ties to Russia.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"March 6, 2017",2237
 Hillary Clinton’s Real Record On LGBT Rights,"Hillary Clinton is a complicated woman running in a country that wants its political platforms to fit on a trucker s cap. As a candidate, she has taken a lot of heat from progressives for being late to coming around to marriage equality. She was, but it s not that simple. If you scratch just a little beneath the surface, you ll find a true champion of LGBT rights throughout the world.When it comes to Clinton s evolution on LGBT rights, there are a lot of legitimate complaints. First, her husband s legacy, although also not that simple, is the failed military policy of Don t Ask, Don t Tell. Bill Clinton didn t love the policy, but it was what he saw as the best compromise at the time.Of course, that wasn t Hillary s policy. In fact, in 1999, she said she was against Don t Ask, Don t Tell, so let s move on. The criticism that has the most teeth is that Hillary didn t come around to accepting marriage equality until just three years ago, but that was only one step in a long history of support.One accomplishment that has received scant attention is that she ushered gay rights onto the international stage. It is fair to say that without Clinton s efforts, the global struggle for equality for gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people would not have proceeded as fast as it has in the past several years, nor would the United States be seen today as a global leader in that struggle. At the heart of these efforts was the 2011 United Nations Human Rights Council Resolution on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity, otherwise known as the UNHRC Gay Rights Resolution, an international agreement whose drafting and signing Clinton oversaw. With that document, and a sister UNHRC resolution of 2014 condemning anti-LGBT violence and discrimination, the UN has formally recognized gay rights as part of the international human rights regime.Clinton s gay rights crusade began within the State Department, which she transformed into one of the most if not the most gay-friendly bureaucracies in Washington, both in terms of its policies and its administration. This signaled a radical makeover for the stodgy institution, which under Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice, Clinton s predecessors in the George W. Bush administration, had seen little drive for gay equality. Largely beholden to the Christian right and social conservatives, the Bush administration was hostile toward LGBT people and issues. As president, Bush endorsed an amendment to the federal constitution banning same-sex marriage, and his political managers used same-sex marriage as a wedge issue during his reelection campaign in 2004 with the intention of mobilizing so-called values voters in swing states like Ohio.Source: Foreign AffairsHer support of LGBT rights didn t stop in international waters. She extended family leave and other government benefits to families of same-sex couples who worked in the State Department.She fought discrimination in the State Department, despite a 1950s executive order by Dwight Eisenhower to fire all gay people, because homosexuality was considered a risk. Clinton instead recognized the Gays and Lesbians in Foreign Affairs Association (GLIFAA) for its  courageous actions in the face of historic discrimination.  She also ended the firings.Clinton even had gay pride celebrations at embassies and consulates throughout the world. Every May 17th, to celebrate International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia, embassies hang rainbow flags. She also made a concerted effort to be inclusive in her hiring, by, among other things, appointing six openly gay ambassadors to serve on several continents.Here she is with her own words:Don t take my word, or hers, for it. She s been endorsed by nearly every LGBT organization.Featured image via Getty Images",News,"June 19, 2016",3792
This Spontaneous Act By Trump At A VA Rally Showed A Side of Him Most Americans Never See [VIDEO],"After watching this video, and seeing a side of Trump the media rarely shows us, it s easy to understand why all of Donald s kids think he s such a great dad A cute little boy in the audience asked Trump a question at his Manassas, Virginia rally on Dec. 2, 2015. Trump thought it was such a great question, he asked the boy to come up on the stage and ask the question again in front of the mic.

It wasn t his answer Trump gave the young boy that revealed the genuine love Trump has for his fellow American, it was the spontaneous kiss he gave the little boy on the back of his head for asking such a great question.The exchange went like this:The young boy asks Trump a question that may be hard for the audience to hear, so Trump asks boy to come up on stage:Trump: C mon, c mob up here.

It s going to be made of hardened concrete and it s going to be made out of Rebar and steel (audience applauds). I mean, that s what I do.

 NRA’s Response To The Florida Shooting Spree That Left 3 Dead Speaks Volumes,"On Sunday, while Floridians braced themselves for Tropical Storm Colin, a gunman decided to Second Amendment two innocent people to death in Cape Coral. According to authorities, the first shooting occurred at about 5:45 p.m. when a gunman killed a motorcyclist at a busy intersection. The suspect then drove to a Circle K gas station where he shot two people, killing one of them. Shortly after the second shooting, police spotted the murderer s car, stopped it and confronted him. The police say that the suspect  violently resist[ed] officers  and he was killed after firing at officers. Two people were found with gunshot wounds in his car, but police have not determined if they were shot by officers or the gunman.Basically, Sunday was another violent day in America. Of course, the biggest pro-gun group, the National Rifle Association, spoke out right away and condemned the shootings. They demanded to know who this shooter was and how he got a gun. They spoke out against Florida s lax laws that allow nearly everyone to buy a weapon. They demanded action and said they want to stop this from happening ever again because dammit! this is America and people should be able to drive down the road or buy a candy bar without being gunned down.Just kidding. The NRA did no such thing; instead, they responded with silence. As usual.Two innocent people are dead and the biggest gun group in the country completely ignored it. They pretended that it didn t even happen because they don t give a shit about the lives and safety of the citizens they claim to protect. They do not care that a man was riding his motorcycle on a Sunday evening and never made it home thanks to some gun nut. They do not care about the two people in the Circle K who were shot and the one who passed away from their injuries. They do not care about the thousands of other mothers, fathers, grandparents, aunts, uncles and CHILDREN who are killed every single year in this country.Instead of issuing a statement of remorse and sympathy to the loved ones of the victims, the NRA used their time to attack Hillary Clinton and journalist Katie Couric on Twitter.Oh look: @HillaryClinton won t say if the #2A guarantees an individual right https://t.co/n84mk7pJjm  NRA (@NRA) June 6, 2016 There s still time to sign up, but the clock is ticking! https://t.co/CUDLrWHQ1N#firekatie#UndertheGunpic.twitter.com/Fp7mcvfugq  NRA (@NRA) June 6, 2016That was more important than acknowledging the loss of life in Florida and it speaks volumes about their real priorities.

And I will say this, and I didn t realize this. But I was told. You will have a very large crowd of people. I don t know as large or larger. Some people said it will be larger. Pro-life people and they say the press doesn t cover them.MUIR: I don t want to compare crowd sizes again. I   I I TRUMP: No, you should But let me just tell you. What you do say is that the press doesn t cover them.MUIR: We saw the marches around the country and you are their president now. Do you sense the responsibility to reach out now and to unite them? For those women, men and children who marched who are watching this, what would you say to them?TRUMP: I do, but I have to also say, we just had an election. A few weeks ago. And they voted in many cases, and some cases they didn t vote I imagine. And we did have an election.

 Major Corporation Leaves South Carolina After Republican Introduces Anti-LGBT Bill,"South Carolina Republicans just introduced an anti-LGBT bill similar to laws passed in North Carolina and Mississippi, and they are already paying the price for it.GOP state Senator Lee Bright thinks trans people are a threat to the safety of women and children in bathrooms despite there being zero evidence of it across the country. I mean, years ago we kept talking about tolerance, tolerance, and tolerance, and now they want men who claim to be women to be able to go into bathrooms with children,  Bright said on the floor of the state Senate while introducing his legislation.  And you got corporations who say this is okay. But Bright s claim is a complete lie that is not based in fact. In 17 states and over 200 cities across the country that have passed protections for LGBT people against discrimination, there has not been a single recorded instance of a trans person entering a women s bathroom to sexually harass anyone.Yet Republicans have made the claim to justify their anti-LGBT bills anyway, making discrimination legal under the guise of religious liberty. North Carolina passed the odious law last month, and Mississippi did the same this month. So far, both states have faced a severe backlash and it is costing both states dearly.Businesses and corporations are threatening to pull out of the state and many have already done so or cancelled plans to expand into the states. Both are also facing the loss of billions of federal dollars.And corporations aren t even waiting for South Carolina Republicans to pass their own bill into law. Just introducing it was enough for one CEO to move his company to California rather than remain in a state that still embraces bigotry.Uphold is a financial services industry that allows users of the service to transfer deposits of bitcoin into reserve-backed currencies such as the dollar. It s a fast-growing business that has handled nearly $1 billion in transactions in just the last two years.CEO Anthony Watson is so disgusted by Bright s bill that he has decided to move his company, which is headquartered in Charleston, out of the state. Uphold is founded on the key pillars of transparency and accountability, and at our very core, we stand for fairness, inclusion and equality,  Watson wrote in a statement on the company website.  Just as Uphold brings financial services to everyone, everywhere, we ve also built a company that brings the principles of fairness, inclusion and equality to everything we do. Watson then proceeded to rip South Carolina Republicans a new one and announced his decision to launch a preemptive exodus out of the state rather than sit and watch as bigoted Republicans jam the bill into law. As the openly gay, British CEO of an American company, I have watched in shock and dismay as legislation has been abruptly proposed or enacted in several states across the union seeking to invalidate the basic protections and rights of LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) U.S. citizens.Some of you may be aware that Uphold s U.S. headquarters is based in Charleston, South Carolina. In recent days, we have been made aware that South Carolina Sen. Lee Bright has introduced a bill largely mirroring North Carolina s controversial law that blocks local governments from passing LGBT-inclusive anti-discrimination ordinances. As such, we feel compelled to take action to oppose the discrimination being proposed in South Carolina and protect our LGBT employees.Today, Uphold has taken the difficult decision to move its U.S. corporate Headquarters from Charleston, South Carolina to Los Angeles, California.We will stand firm in our commitment to fairness, equality and inclusion and our strong conviction that we can make a difference by living our core values. It s the right thing to do for our members, employees, partners and the communities in which we live and work. The bold move will cost South Carolinians hundreds of jobs and will likely be a major blow to the state and local economies. It s just a taste of what South Carolina Republicans can expect if they continue on the path of taking the state backwards.Featured iamge via Wikimedia",News,"April 13, 2016",4152
" Trump’s List Of ‘Unreported’ Terror Attacks Is Out, And It’s ABSURD (CITATIONS)","Earlier today, Trump said to a crowd at MacDill Air Force Base that the  very dishonest media  wasn t reporting on the terror attacks that are happening all across Europe all the time. Later on, the media pressed Sean Spicer on that topic while aboard Air Force One, and Spicer s response was to say that they d provide a list  later on.  Well, that list is out, and surprise surprise, it s completely ridiculous.Since Trump s comments focused on Europe and, by extension, the U.S., the following lists are focused there, despite many, many other attacks happening around the world.Perhaps one of the most ridiculous things about the White House s list of attacks is that it includes high-profile attacks that were covered for days on end, such as the 2015 attack against Charlie Hebdo in Paris, and the fateful attack at a Paris club in November. It also includes two foiled attacks that were also widely reported. Broken down:They also list several attacks in France in 2016 that were covered extensively.Then they list an attack in London in December 2015 that was covered by CNN, Reuters, The Huffington Post, USA Today, and more.There s one in Copenhagen, Denmark in February of 2015 that was covered by CNN, The New York Times, USA Today, The Huffington Post, Reuters, and more.Most of us probably remember the March 2016 attack in Brussels, Belgium, which was covered by CNN, NPR, The New York Times, CBS News, NBC News, USA Today, ABC News, and more.But that s Europe. What about the attacks they list here in the U.S. that supposedly weren t covered, or weren t covered extensively enough? Like the following:Really? So far we ve looked closely at 18 of the attacks listed, and they were all widely covered by U.S. media. Trump and his minions insist that we re not covering attacks in Europe hardly at all, and then they provide a list with 30 attacks that are in the Middle East, parts of Asia, and in Indonesia and the Philippines.Those attacks are terrible and tragic, too, but again, Trump didn t say anything about us not covering attacks in those regions. He probably didn t even think about those regions until whoever it was that compiled that list gave it to him (if they gave it to him).But the biggest falsehood is that the media isn t reporting, or is underreporting, on these attacks. It s like they hurriedly compiled a list of terror attacks worldwide from Wikipedia and couldn t be bothered to proofread, let alone research. There are spelling errors in addition to the lie that the media covers up attacks. Our dishonest  president,  has a lot of nerve accusing the media of actively covering up terrorist attacks.The full list, as provided to CNN, is below. Feel free to Google whatever you want:Here s the list the White House sent of attacks they feel  did not receive adequate attention from Western media sources.  pic.twitter.com/lj8eOZQfnY  Kevin Liptak (@Kevinliptakcnn) February 7, 2017Read more:Featured image by Alex Wong via Getty Images",News,"February 6, 2017",2976
GREEN PARTY DOLT Struggles To Explain Wisconsin Election Recount [Video],"IAN JACKSON: People have been slightly concerned about the trail and as your last guest pointed out it s very decentralized.ED HENRYY: Uh-huh. When you say  slightly concerned,  that doesn t sound to me like there s widespread allegations or more importantly evidence of some sort of fraud. So is this giving Jill Stein supporters some sort of false hope?JACKSON: Well, I [pause] there s we re [pause] trying to find what the count is and [pause] I m not sure it s false hope. It s trying to find the truth behind the numbers. There has been these allegations by computer scientists but as your last guest pointed out, it was using different systems and using that, being engineers, um, I m a software engineer and we like our little [pause] models, but unless you actually count and check it, you don t know whether it s just a thoughy well, they used something different or if there s something to it.And you mentioned your show is all about finding truth.HENRY: Let s find that truth. My next question is, our last guest, who you cited several times, Craig Gilbert, also said, accurately, that in 2000 and 2004 the margin was even closer in the presidential race and there was no recount. So what s your case tonight?JACKSON: [pause] Well, the case [pause] tonight, you can see that there that was [pause] a real contentious election [pause], and, based on that there are people that have expressed concerns. So, it s best to find the truth and go through the process. And obviously people have been willing to put up millions of dollars [pause] to find out and count the ballots again.HENRY: Okay, so final question: if you really want to get at the truth can we get at another truth which is that it appears that Jill Stein has raised about $5 million for a recount that may or may not happen for fraud that may or may not have happened. If there s nothing found here and if there s not even a recount will you pledge tonight that you and others in the Green Party believe that that money should be refunded, so this is not just money being raised on false hope?JACKSON: Well, we re exploring that I m only treasurer for the Green-Rainbow party. We re certainly going   if it doesn t get used, we re certainly going to discuss with our donors what their desire is for that money. ",politics,"Nov 26, 2016",2285
BREAKING…OBAMA’S WAR ON COPS: ANOTHER Cop Ambushed And SHOT 3 Times In Neck By Black Man With Lengthy Criminal History In W. St. Louis,"Did America really expect this racist, Community Organizer In Chief to go out quietly? Barack and Mooch have played Americans like fools for 8 long years. No wonder Mooch was never proud of her country before Barack became President. The white man had not yet been sufficiently punished for the crimes of his ancestors against the black man. If America knew this is what it would take to make Mooch and her radical husband proud, would they have still voted for him? Thank goodness for Barack, he s got Hillary to unashamedly keep the torch of hate lit, in order to keep the Democrats dependent upon them to  even the playing field. A Ballwin Police officer was in critical condition after he was shot in the neck during a traffic stop late Friday morning, police said.The male officer had stopped the car for speeding on northbound New Ballwin Road about 11 a.m., police said. As the officer went back to his car, the driver got out,  advanced quickly  and fired three shots at the officer, police said.Said St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar:  Make no mistake, we believe that Ballwin officer was ambushed. St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch agreed. It was clearly an ambush, an attack,  he said.  There was no confrontation, no argument, no nothing. He also said it appeared that one of the shots might have been fired after the officer fell.The gunman fled north on New Ballwin Road and was captured in Manchester several miles northeast of the shooting scene, after jumping out of the car and running, police said.A semiautomatic handgun was recovered, according to St. Louis County Police, who are taking over the investigation.The suspect, identified as Antonio Taylor, 31, of the 1200 block of Tower Grove Avenue, was charged with first-degree assault of a law enforcement officer, armed criminal action and unlawful possession of a weapon. Bail was set at $500,000.Belmar, the St. Louis County chief, said his department has gone to 12-hour days throughout the weekend as result of heightened sense of alert after all that has happened nationally and now locally. We need somebody out there to meet us halfway, because it is very difficult for police officers to do their jobs now,  Belmar said.  At some point we need to tone down the rhetoric. The officer had radioed in that he was stopping a car about 11 a.m., police said. Then 911 dispatchers began getting reports of an officer shot.A woman living in the 300 block of New Ballwin Road near the scene of the shooting said she heard two gunshots and ran out her front door to see what happened. After seeing the wounded officer, she grabbed a towel to put on his neck to try to stop the bleeding. I tried to help the officer,  the witness said.  I just hope he s OK. The woman who helped the officer said she isn t trained as a nurse or first responder.  I m just a mom,  she said.She said her friend called 911 while a nurse performed CPR.Other residents living near the scene of the shooting said they heard gunshots but didn t know what they were at first. I thought it was kids or firecrackers or something,  said a resident on the street.  I m looking outside at many, many police officers. They all need our prayers. A camera in the police car caught the shooting on video, Scott said. He urged anyone else with any video of the incident to call police.Criminal historyIn 2006, Taylor was charged and convicted in Beck County, Okla., on charges of second-degree robbery and unauthorized use of a vehicle, online records from the Oklahoma Department of Corrections say. He was sentenced to five years in prison and was released in 2009.That same year, St. Louis prosecutors charged Taylor with unlawful possession of a firearm for a July 7, 2009 incident.He pleaded guilty, but his prison sentence was suspended and he was placed on probation by St. Louis Circuit Judge Michael Mullen, online court records show. Mullen also ordered him to have mental health and substance abuse evaluations.Taylor then faced federal and state charges after being caught with a gun on June 14, 2010.Assistant U.S. Attorney Tom Mehan, who prosecuted the case, said that on June 14, 2010, Taylor was caught with a gun in car that had been carjacked the day before.When he pleaded guilty to the charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm, Taylor admitted running when stopped by police and discarding a handgun.U.S. District Judge Jean Hamilton sentenced him on Jan. 14, 2011, to 30 months in prison.He received a two-year sentence in St. Louis Circuit Court for a gun charge and resisting arrest, to run concurrent with the federal sentence.In June of 2013, Taylor wrote a letter to U.S. District Judge Jean Hamilton asking to be released from supervised release early. Taylor wrote that he wanted to pursue an acting career. He said he had been working, had been free of violations and had not failed any drug tests.But later that month, his probation officer said that Taylor had repeatedly failed to show up for those drug tests, failed to report to the probation office, left eastern Missouri without permission and had been accused of assaulting his girlfriend when she refused sex.She also said that Taylor had contact with the police in Los Angeles on June 20, 2013.In that incident, Mehan said that Taylor was the passenger in a car that was stopped for not having license plates. Taylor was the passenger, and became extremely agitated after the stop, screaming and waving his hands around. After he was arrested, police found a loaded 9 mm pistol, Mehan said.In April of 2014, Taylor admitted violating his supervised release and Hamilton sentenced him to 15 more months in prison.He was released in March of 2015.McCulloch said police work is 99 percent routine and  there s no way to predict that something like this is going to happen.

UPDATED VIDEO: IS THIS AMERICA? CONSERVATIVES And Their Families Experience SHOCKING ABUSE And SHAMING In Their Homes Ordered By Leftist DA As Part Of Insane Vendetta,"This story should send chills down the spine of every American. Communism is on our doorstep THEY CAME WITH A BATTERING RAM. Cindy Archer, one of the lead architects of Wisconsin s Act 10   also called the  Wisconsin Budget Repair Bill,  it limited public-employee benefits and altered collective-bargaining rules for public-employee unions   was jolted awake by yelling, loud pounding at the door, and her dogs  frantic barking. The entire house   the windows and walls   was shaking.She looked outside to see up to a dozen police officers, yelling to open the door. They were carrying a battering ram. She wasn t dressed, but she started to run toward the door, her body in full view of the police. Some yelled at her to grab some clothes, others yelled for her to open the door. I was so afraid,  she says.  I did not know what to do.  She grabbed some clothes, opened the door, and dressed right in front of the police. The dogs were still frantic. I begged and begged,  Please don t shoot my dogs, please don t shoot my dogs, just don t shoot my dogs.  I couldn t get them to stop barking, and I couldn t get them outside quick enough. I saw a gun and barking dogs. I was scared and knew this was a bad mix.  She got the dogs safely out of the house, just as multiple armed agents rushed inside.Some even barged into the bathroom, where her partner was in the shower. The officer or agent in charge demanded that Cindy sit on the couch, but she wanted to get up and get a cup of coffee.  I told him this was my house and I could do what I wanted.  Wrong thing to say.  This made the agent in charge furious. He towered over me with his finger in my face and yelled like a drill sergeant that I either do it his way or he would handcuff me. They wouldn t let her speak to a lawyer.She looked outside and saw a person who appeared to be a reporter. Someone had tipped him off. The neighbors started to come outside, curious at the commotion, and all the while the police searched her house, making a mess, and   according to Cindy   leaving her  dead mother s belongings strewn across the basement floor in a most disrespectful way. Then they left, carrying with them only a cellphone and a laptop.Here is a videotaped interview of a neighbor who witnessed the police invasion of her home: IT S A MATTER OF LIFE OR DEATH.  That was the first thought of  Anne  (not her real name).Someone was pounding at her front door. It was early in the morning   very early   and it was the kind of heavy pounding that meant someone was either fleeing from   or bringing   trouble.  It was so hard. I d never heard anything like it. I thought someone was dying outside. She ran to the door, opened it, and then chaos.  People came pouring in. For a second I thought it was a home invasion. It was terrifying. They were yelling and running, into every room in the house. One of the men was in my face, yelling at me over and over and over. It was indeed a home invasion, but the people who were pouring in were Wisconsin law-enforcement officers. Armed, uniformed police swarmed into the house. Plainclothes investigators cornered her and her newly awakened family.Soon, state officials were seizing the family s personal property, including each person s computer and smartphone, filled with the most intimate family information.Why were the police at Anne s home? She had no answers. The police were treating them the way they d seen police treat drug dealers on television. In fact, TV or movies were their only points of reference, because they weren t criminals. They were law-abiding. They didn t buy or sell drugs. They weren t violent. They weren t a danger to anyone. Yet there were cops   surrounding their house on the outside, swarming the house on the inside.They even taunted the family as if they were mere  perps. As if the home invasion, the appropriation of private property, and the verbal abuse weren t enough, next came ominous warnings.Don t call your lawyer. Don t tell anyone about this raid. Not even your mother, your father, or your closest friends.The entire neighborhood could see the police around their house, but they had to remain silent. This was not the  right to remain silent  as uttered by every cop on every legal drama on television   the right against self-incrimination.They couldn t mount a public defense if they wanted   or even offer an explanation to family and friends. Yet no one in this family was a  perp. Instead, like Cindy, they were American citizens guilty of nothing more than exercising their First Amendment rights to support Act 10 and other conservative causes in Wisconsin. Sitting there shocked and terrified, this citizen   who is still too intimidated to speak on the record   kept thinking,  Is this America? THEY FOLLOWED ME TO MY KIDS  ROOMS.  For the family of  Rachel  (not her real name), the ordeal began before dawn   with the same loud, insistent knocking. Still in her pajamas, Rachel answered the door and saw uniformed police, poised to enter her home.When Rachel asked to wake her children herself, the officer insisted on walking into their rooms. The kids woke to an armed officer, standing near their beds. The entire family was herded into one room, and there they watched as the police carried off their personal possessions, including items that had nothing to do with the subject of the search warrant   even her daughter s computer.And, yes, there were the warnings. Don t call your lawyer. Don t talk to anyone about this. Don t tell your friends.The kids watched   alarmed   as the school bus drove by, with the students inside watching the spectacle of uniformed police surrounding the house, carrying out the family s belongings. Yet they were told they couldn t tell anyone at school. They, too, had to remain silent.The mom watched as her entire life was laid open before the police. Her professional files, her personal files, everything. She knew this was all politics. She knew a rogue prosecutor was targeting her for her political beliefs. And she realized,  Every aspect of my life is in their hands. And they hate me. Fortunately for her family, the police didn t taunt her or her children. Some of them seemed embarrassed by what they were doing. At the end of the ordeal, one officer looked at the family, still confined to one room, and said,  Some days, I hate my job. For dozens of conservatives, the years since Scott Walker s first election as governor of Wisconsin transformed the state   known for pro-football championships, good cheese, and a population with a reputation for being unfailingly polite   into a place where conservatives have faced early-morning raids, multi-year secretive criminal investigations, slanderous and selective leaks to sympathetic media, and intrusive electronic snooping.Yes, Wisconsin, the cradle of the progressive movement and home of the  Wisconsin idea    the marriage of state governments and state universities to govern through technocratic reform   was giving birth to a new progressive idea, the use of law enforcement as a political instrument, as a weapon to attempt to undo election results, shame opponents, and ruin lives.Most Americans have never heard of these raids, or of the lengthy criminal investigations of Wisconsin conservatives. For good reason. Bound by comprehensive secrecy orders, conservatives were left to suffer in silence as leaks ruined their reputations, as neighbors, looking through windows and dismayed at the massive police presence, the lights shining down on targets  homes, wondered, no doubt, What on earth did that family do?This was the on-the-ground reality of the so-called John Doe investigations, expansive and secret criminal proceedings that directly targeted Wisconsin residents because of their relationship to Scott Walker, their support for Act 10, and their advocacy of conservative reform.Largely hidden from the public eye, this traumatic process, however, is now heading toward a legal climax, with two key rulings expected in the late spring or early summer.The first ruling, from the Wisconsin supreme court, could halt the investigations for good, in part by declaring that the  misconduct  being investigated isn t misconduct at all but the simple exercise of First Amendment rights.The second ruling, from the United States Supreme Court, could grant review on a federal lawsuit brought by Wisconsin political activist Eric O Keefe and the Wisconsin Club for Growth, the first conservatives to challenge the investigations head-on.If the Court grants review, it could not only halt the investigations but also begin the process of holding accountable those public officials who have so abused their powers.But no matter the outcome of these court hearings, the damage has been done. In the words of Mr. O Keefe,  The process is the punishment. UPDATED VIDEO INTERVIEW WITH BLAZE TV s DANA LOESCH:It all began innocently enough. In 2009, officials from the office of the Milwaukee County executive contacted the office of the Milwaukee district attorney, headed by John Chisholm, to investigate the disappearance of $11,242.24 from the Milwaukee chapter of the Order of the Purple Heart.The matter was routine, with witnesses willing and able to testify against the principal suspect, a man named Kevin Kavanaugh.What followed, however, was anything but routine. Chisholm failed to act promptly on the report, and when he did act, he refused to conduct a conventional criminal investigation but instead petitioned, in May 2010, to open a  John Doe  investigation, a proceeding under Wisconsin law that permits Wisconsin officials to conduct extensive investigations while keeping the target s identity secret (hence the designation  John Doe ).John Doe investigations alter typical criminal procedure in two important ways: First, they remove grand juries from the investigative process, replacing the ordinary citizens of a grand jury with a supervising judge.Second, they can include strict secrecy requirements not just on the prosecution but also on the targets of the investigation. In practice, this means that, while the prosecution cannot make public comments about the investigation, it can take public actions indicating criminal suspicion (such as raiding businesses and homes in full view of the community) while preventing the targets of the raids from defending against or even discussing the prosecution s claims.Why would Chisholm seek such broad powers to investigate a year-old embezzlement claim with a known suspect? Because the Milwaukee County executive, Scott Walker, had by that time become the leading Republican candidate for governor. District Attorney Chisholm was a Democrat, a very partisan Democrat.Almost immediately after opening the John Doe investigation, Chisholm used his expansive powers to embarrass Walker, raiding his county-executive offices within a week.As Mr. O Keefe and the Wisconsin Club for Growth explained in court filings, the investigation then dramatically expanded: Over the next few months, [Chisholm s] investigation of all-things-Walker expanded to include everything from alleged campaign-finance violations to sexual misconduct to alleged public contracting bid-rigging to alleged misuse of county time and property.Between May 5, 2010, and May 3, 2012, the Milwaukee Defendants filed at least eighteen petitions to formally  [e]nlarge  the scope of the John Doe investigation, and each was granted. . .That amounts to a new formal inquiry every five and a half weeks, on average, for two years.This expansion coincided with one of the more remarkable state-level political controversies in modern American history   the protest (and passage) of Act 10, followed by the attempted recall of a number of Wisconsin legislators and, ultimately, Governor Walker.Political observers will no doubt remember the events in Madison   the state capitol overrun by chanting protesters, Democratic lawmakers fleeing the state to prevent votes on the legislation, and tens of millions of dollars of outside money flowing into the state as Wisconsin became, fundamentally, a proxy fight pitting the union-led Left against the Tea Party led economic Right.At the same time that the public protests were raging, so were private   but important   protests in the Chisholm home and workplace.As a former prosecutor told journalist Stuart Taylor, Chisholm s wife was a teachers -union shop steward who was distraught over Act 10 s union reforms. He said Chisholm  felt it was his personal duty  to stop them. Meanwhile, according to this whistleblower, the district attorney s offices were festooned with the  blue fist  poster of the labor-union movement, indicating that Chisholm s employees were very much invested in the political fight.In the end, the John Doe proceeding failed in its ultimate aims. It secured convictions for embezzlement (related to the original 2009 complaint), a conviction for sexual misconduct, and a few convictions for minor campaign violations, but Governor Walker was untouched, his reforms were implemented, and he survived his recall election. But with another election looming   this time Walker s campaign for reelection   Chisholm wasn t finished.He launched yet another John Doe investigation,  supervised  by Judge Barbara Kluka. Kluka proved to be capable of superhuman efficiency   approving  every petition, subpoena, and search warrant in the case  in a total of one day s work.If the first series of John Doe investigations was  everything Walker,  the second series was  everything conservative,  as Chisholm had launched an investigation of not only Walker (again) but the Wisconsin Club for Growth and dozens of other conservative organizations, this time fishing for evidence of allegedly illegal  coordination  between conservative groups and the Walker campaign.In the second John Doe, Chisholm had no real evidence of wrongdoing. Yes, conservative groups were active in issue advocacy, but issue advocacy was protected by the First Amendment and did not violate relevant campaign laws.Nonetheless, Chisholm persuaded prosecutors in four other counties to launch their own John Does, with Judge Kluka overseeing all of them.Empowered by a rubber-stamp judge, partisan investigators ran amok. They subpoenaed and obtained (without the conservative targets  knowledge) massive amounts of electronic data, including virtually all the targets  personal e-mails and other electronic messages from outside e-mail vendors and communications companies.The investigations exploded into the open with a coordinated series of raids on October 3, 2013. These were home invasions, including those described above. Chisholm s office refused to comment on the raid tactics (or any other aspect of the John Doe investigations), but witness accounts regarding the two John Doe investigations are remarkably similar: early-morning intrusions, police rushing through the house, and stern commands to remain silent and tell no one about what had occurred.At the same time, the Wisconsin Club for Growth and other conservative organizations received broad subpoenas requiring them to turn over virtually all business records, including  donor information, correspondence with their associates, and all financial information.  The subpoenas also contained dire warnings about disclosure of their existence, threatening contempt of court if the targets spoke publicly.For select conservative families across five counties, this was the terrifying moment   the moment they felt at the mercy of a truly malevolent state.Speaking both on and off the record, targets reflected on how many layers of Wisconsin government failed their fundamental constitutional duties   the prosecutors who launched the rogue investigations, the judge who gave the abuse judicial sanction, investigators who chose to taunt and intimidate during the raids, and those police who ultimately approved and executed aggressive search tactics on law-abiding, peaceful citizens.For some of the families, the trauma of the raids, combined with the stress and anxiety of lengthy criminal investigations, has led to serious emotional repercussions.  Devastating  is how Anne describes the impact on her family.  Life-changing,  she says.  All in terrible ways. O Keefe, who has been in contact with multiple targeted families, says,  Every family I know of that endured a home raid has been shaken to its core, and the fate of marriages and families still hangs in the balance in some cases. Anne also describes a new fear of the police:  I used to support the police, to believe they were here to protect us. Now, when I see an officer, I ll cross the street. I m afraid of them. I know what they re capable of.  Cindy says,  I lock my doors and I close my shades. I don t answer the door unless I am expecting someone. My heart races when I see a police car sitting in front of my house or following me in the car.The raid was so public. I ve been harassed. My house has been vandalized. [She did not identify suspects.] I no longer feel safe, and I don t think I ever will. Rachel talks about the effect on her children.  I tried to create a home where the kids always feel safe. Now they know they re not. They know men with guns can come in their house, and there s nothing we can do.  Every knock on the door brings anxiety. Every call to the house is screened. In the back of her mind is a single, unsettling thought: These people will never stop.Victims of trauma   and every person I spoke with described the armed raids as traumatic   often need to talk, to share their experiences and seek solace in the company of a loving family and supportive friends. The investigators denied them that privilege, and it compounded their pain and fear. The investigation not only damaged families, it also shut down their free speech. In many cases, the investigations halted conservative groups in their tracks.O Keefe and the Wisconsin Club for Growth described the effect in court filings: O Keefe s associates began cancelling meetings with him and declining to take his calls, reasonably fearful that merely associating with him could make them targets of the investigation.O Keefe was forced to abandon fundraising for the Club because he could no longer guarantee to donors that their identities would remain confidential, could not (due to the Secrecy Order) explain to potential donors the nature of the investigation, could not assuage donors  fears that they might become targets themselves, and could not assure donors that their money would go to fund advocacy rather than legal expenses.The Club was also paralyzed. Its officials could not associate with its key supporters, and its funds were depleted. It could not engage in issue advocacy for fear of criminal sanction.These raids and subpoenas were often based not on traditional notions of probable cause but on mere suspicion, untethered to the law or evidence, and potentially violating the Fourth Amendment s prohibition against  unreasonable searches and seizures.  The very existence of First Amendment protected expression was deemed to be evidence of illegality.The prosecution simply assumed that the conservatives were incapable of operating within the bounds of the law. Even worse, many of the investigators  legal theories, even if proven by the evidence, would not have supported criminal prosecutions. In other words, they were investigating  crimes  that weren t crimes at all.If the prosecutors had applied the same legal standards to the Democrats in their own offices, they would have been forced to turn the raids on themselves. If the prosecutors and investigators had been raided, how many of their computers and smartphones would have contained incriminating information indicating use of government resources for partisan purposes?With the investigations now bursting out into the open, some conservatives began to fight back. O Keefe and the Wisconsin Club for Growth moved to quash the John Doe subpoenas aimed at them.In a surprise move, Judge Kluka, who had presided over the Doe investigations for more than a year, recused herself from the case. (A political journal, the Wisconsin Reporter, attempted to speak to Judge Kluka about her recusal, but she refused to offer comment.)The new judge in the case, Gregory Peterson, promptly sided with O Keefe and blocked multiple subpoenas, holding (in a sealed opinion obtained by the Wall Street Journal, which has done invaluable work covering the John Doe investigations) that they  do not show probable cause that the moving parties committed any violations of the campaign finance laws. The judge noted that  the State is not claiming that any of the independent organizations expressly advocated  Walker s election. O Keefe and the Wisconsin Club for Growth followed up Judge Peterson s ruling by filing a federal lawsuit against Chisholm and a number of additional defendants, alleging multiple constitutional violations, including a claim that the investigation constituted unlawful retaliation against the plaintiffs for the exercise of their First Amendment rights.United States District Court judge Rudolph Randa promptly granted the plaintiffs  motion for a preliminary injunction, declaring that  the Defendants must cease all activities related to the investigation, return all property seized in the investigation from any individual or organization, and permanently destroy all copies of information and other materials obtained through the investigation. From that point forward, the case proceeded on parallel state and federal tracks. At the federal level, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Judge Randa s order.Declining to consider the case on the merits, the appeals court found the lawsuit barred by the federal Anti-Injunction Act, which prohibits federal courts from issuing injunctions against some state-court proceedings.O Keefe and the Wisconsin Club for Growth have petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari and expect a ruling in a matter of weeks.At the same time, the John Doe prosecutors took their case to the Wisconsin Court of Appeals to attempt to restart the Doe proceedings. The case was ultimately consolidated before the state supreme court, with a ruling also expected in a matter of weeks.And so, almost five years after their secret beginning, the John Doe proceedings are nearly dead   on  life support,  according to one Wisconsin pundit   but incalculable damage has been done, to families, to activist organizations, to the First Amendment, and to the rule of law itself.In international law, the Western world has become familiar with a concept called  lawfare,  a process whereby rogue regimes or organizations abuse legal doctrines and processes to accomplish through sheer harassment and attrition what can t be accomplished through legitimate diplomatic means. The Palestinian Authority and its defenders have become adept at lawfare, putting Israel under increasing pressure before the U.N. and other international bodies.The John Doe investigations are a form of domestic lawfare, and our constitutional system is ill equipped to handle it. Federal courts rarely intervene in state judicial proceedings, state officials rarely lose their array of official immunities for the consequences of their misconduct, and violations of First Amendment freedoms rarely result in meaningful monetary damages for the victims.As Scott Walker runs for president, the national media will finally join the Wall Street Journal in covering John Doe.Given the mainstream media s typical bias and bad faith, they are likely to bring a fresh round of pain to the targets of the investigation; the cloud of suspicion will descend once again; even potential favorable court rulings by either the state supreme court or the U.S. Supreme Court will be blamed on  conservative justices  taking care of their own.Conservatives have looked at Wisconsin as a success story, where Walker took everything the Left threw at him and emerged victorious in three general elections. He broke the power of the teachers  unions and absorbed millions upon millions of dollars of negative ads. The Left kept chanting,  This is what democracy looks like,  and in Wisconsin, democracy looked like Scott Walker winning again and again.Yet in a deeper way, Wisconsin is anything but a success. There were casualties left on the battlefield   innocent citizens victimized by a lawless government mob, public officials who brought the full power of their office down onto the innocent.Governors come and go. Statutes are passed and repealed. Laws and elections are important, to be sure, but the rule of law is more important still. And in Wisconsin, the rule of law hangs in the balance   along with the liberty of citizens.As I finished an interview with one victim still living in fear, still shattered by the experience of nearly losing everything simply because she supported the wrong candidate at the wrong time, I asked whether she had any final thoughts.  Just one,  she replied.  I m hoping for accountability, that someone will be held responsible so that they ll never do this again.  She paused for a moment and then, with voice trembling, said:  No one should ever endure what my family endured. Via: National Review",Government News,"Apr 21, 2015",25331
 Right-Wing Mom Beats Her Kids To A Bloody Pulp To ‘Lead’ Them To God (VIDEO),"The right-wing mom who forced her children to sing songs to the Bundy terrorists after they seized a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon experienced a revolt of her own when her children took away her guns and fled the house in search of help from law enforcement.The five kids escaped the home because they wanted the beatings they constantly endured to end.Authorities arrested Odalis Sharp on Friday for beating the children bloody with a rod in the name of God in what she called her way of leading them to Christianity. We need to turn to God, because the system is corrupt,  Sharp said before accusing the government of waging a vendetta against her.  They lie, they twist, they make false charges, they abuse people, and then they turn around and put people in prison, and then they accuse them of abuse. But it isn t the government accusing Sharp of abuse, it s her own children.They testified on Wednesday that their mother mercilessly abused them most days of the week by calling them names, forcing them to eat soap, and beating them bloody with a belt or rod as well as slapping them and hitting them in their private parts. They said it s typical to always receive some type of bruising and other times have bled from the swats,  a social worker told the court.  The children told me they were fearful. They did not want to return to their mother. The sheriff also described how one child told him that one of spankings  consisted of 47 swats,  and that after 27 spankings the abused child began bleeding. Sharp s 15-year-old son fled the home to escape constant beatings as well and Sharp explained it by saying the boy rejected  the right, wholesome and pure path in which I was leading him   in which God was leading us. And the kids don t have to go back to their mother either because the judge removed the children from Sharp s custody and placed them in the custody of the Kansas Department of Children and Families.Here s the video of Sharp s rant via YouTube.This is yet another case of how conservatives twist and use religion to excuse horrible acts. This woman dragged her kids to the center of a standoff between the FBI and a bunch of gun-toting right-wing terrorists and that s on top of the constant beatings they suffered at the hands of their mother who actually thinks she is doing God s work by bloodying up her kids.That probably makes televangelist Pat Robertson smile, but is hardly an acceptable way to treat children in modern society. If you have to resort to beating religion into kids, your religion is truly weak.Featured image via screenshot",News,"May 5, 2016",2582
DETROIT FREE PRESS EDITOR Calls For Gruesome Murder Of MI GOP Lawmakers,"Read anything Stephen Henderson has written over the past year and you will be hard pressed to find a single piece where he is not crying about some injustice either he or his fellow black man has suffered. Anyone who reads his whiny drivel for more than a couple of months will likely need some sort of therapy to keep them from wanting to jump off the nearest ledge on a tall building. Henderson is a perfect example of the wussification of the male in the United States. We ve met and spoken with him before. Henderson is not embarrassed to say he s a hardened liberal. He blames it on his U of D Catholic High School education. He claims they  pumped liberalism and social justice through his veins.  As a Catholic, I find this type of rhetoric gut-wrenching, irresponsible and the furthest thing from the type of love and compassion for my neighbor I learned as a young Catholic. If representatives of working citizens who live in the suburbs of Detroit, refuse to burden them with hundreds of millions of tax dollars to bail out the failed Detroit Public Schools (yet again), Stephen Henderson says they should be murdered.Stephen Henderson, the Pulitzer prize-winning editorial page editor of the Detroit Free Press has called for the murder of Michigan lawmakers with whom he disagrees.The reason? The lawmakers voted for legislation that would give parents more choices to avoid Michigan s failing public schools. Detroit s public schools are failing academically and nearly insolvent, the New York Times wrote in January. The Detroit News wrote in March that  the statewide opinion of K-12 education is downright ugly.  That poll showed residents didn t think throwing money at public-union-controlled schools was the answer, with 63 percent saying it takes more than money to improve education.Yesterday Michigan s Republican legislators voted to bail out Detroit s abysmally run schools with $617 million in taxpayer funding. The same bill also fought efforts to constrain charter school choices in Detroit. Prior to the vote, Stephen Henderson wrote on his editorial page:We really ought to round up the lawmakers who took money to protect and perpetuate the failing charter-school experiment in Detroit, sew them into burlap sacks with rabid animals, and toss them into the Straits of Mackinac.That s harsh. Maybe.But isn t that what the Romans or Greeks or some other early practitioners of democracy used to do with solicitous and unprincipled public officials?And this legislation that passed the state House of Representatives Thursday night, the one that bows to the thoroughly debunked theory that a free-for-all, market-based approach to public schooling will produce quality choices for Detroit parents?It is garbage.It is bought-and-paid-for work product from a legislative body whose leader, the maladroit thinker Kevin Cotter, has sold his caucus  political soul to the high-bidding DeVos family and other charter advocates and told himself it s about belief, not money.In the most crass terms, the House of Representatives is telling parents in Detroit that the best we deserve is what we have now. Public schools that have been underfunded and torn asunder by depopulation and corruption. Charters opening and closing willy-nilly, many to profit off the traditioal public schools  misery, but offering alternatives in name only to the public schools they claim to outperform. The bragging that charter advocates do about the sliver of daylight between the outcomes of charters and traditional public schools would be roll-on-the-floor funny if it weren t so condescending, and it it didn t heartily embrace the idea of calcified inequality.It is every bit deserving of an old-school retributive response.A sack. An animal. A lake.No lover of actual democracy could weep at that outcome.Stephen Henderson s tweeted his Detroit Free Press article and added this disgusting commentary:GOP House harlots deserve worse than hanging for selling out #detroit kids on #DPS bills. https://t.co/zbPajL81qq  Stephen Henderson (@SHendersonFreep) June 3, 2016 ",Government News,"Jun 8, 2016",4074
Mainstream Media Spreads Huge Lie GOP Official Refused Donations for #Houston Relief [Video],"The usual mainstream media suspects are at it again with their fake news reports. Shameless lefty news outlets made up a false story claiming the Texas SOS Rolando Pablos refused aid for Houston Hurricane Harvey victims and instead asked for prayers.The story spread from one sentence in an article from Canada s CBC News: Pablos declined the aid for now, instead asking for  prayers from the people of Quebec,'  the article quotes Quebec s International Relations Minister Christine St-Pierre to have said.  He was very touched by the fact we called him. The CBC has not corrected the lie! Please send feedback (it took me a minute to do so) to them. Tell them to correct the lie they told.NOT TRUE!The report by the CBC didn t tell the whole story. The Texas SOS released a statement with a rebuke to the media reports. CBC confirmed that they had misreported the interview. Contrary to what has been reported in the media, Secretary Pablos did not decline the minister s offer, but instead made sure Quebec made contact with the proper Texas state agency,  a spokeswoman said.  The Quebec Government s office in Houston is in constant contact with local authorities and is arranging for emergency supplies to be shipped shortly. Washington Free Beacon reported:Left-wing outlets that reported on the aid denial included The New York Daily News, Raw Story, Salon, and The Root. Journalists on Twitter spread the story as well, including Texas-based Vanity Fair reporter and MSNBC contributor Kurt Eichenwald.Yes, THAT Kurt Eichenwald! Remember that he was called out by Tucker Carlson? Why is he still around?

"MEDIA FOCUSES ON CROOKED GRANNY…As Chelsea Gives Birth To Campaign Baby In $1,700/Night Maternity Ward…But Where Are Chelsea’s In-Laws?","As anyone who remotely follows the news knows, media whore Hillary has been dying for a reason to appear in photos unrelated to a story about her criminal activities. True to form, Hillary capitalizes on the birth of Chelsea s campaign baby by standing alone and waving to the crowd how very  grandmotherly .You won t see the other set of grandparents in any pictures however, as the royal Clinton family has banned their son-in-laws family from appearing in any pictures with them Chelsea Clinton has emerged from hospital for the first time with her newborn son Aidan.The former First Daughter beamed at cameras on the steps of New York s Lenox Hill Hospital on Monday, flanked by her husband Marc Mezvinsky and parents Bill and Hillary Clinton.Despite the soaring temperatures, Hillary wore a button-down coat, while Chelsea opted for a floral mini-dress.Aidan, Chelsea s second child with husband Marc Mezvinsky, was born on Saturday in the $1,700-a-night maternity ward.- DMWho is Chelsea Clinton s father-in-law and why are he and his wife banned from appearing in pictures with Crooked Queen Hillary and her sexual predator husband? Edward Maurice  Ed  Mezvinsky, Chelsea Clinton s father-in-law and her daughter s grandfather, is a convicted Felon. The former Democrat Congressman from Iowa s 1st Congressional District in the United States House of Representatives, served two terms, from 1973 to 1977.Ed Mezvinsky has known Hillary Clinton since the days when he served on the House Judiciary Committee that decided the fate of President Richard Nixon. This harsh critic of President Richard Nixon, had called Nixon  a crook  and  a disgrace to politics and the nation , and called for Nixon s impeachment.But, did you ever wonder who that allusive  Nigerian Prince  is who might be sending you those emails looking for money? Look no farther than the Clinton Family Tree.Through a series of Nigerian email scams and Ponzi schemes, Ed Mezvinsky, Chelsea Clinton s father-in-law embezzled more than $10 million dollars. In 2001, Ed Mezvinsky was convicted of 31 (out of 69!) charges of fraud, and served five years in federal prison. His fraud charges included bank, mail, wire, as well as other offenses involving financing bogus oil development and other trade deals in Africa.But don t think Ed doesn t keep it in the family. In addition to his law clients and friends, he even bilked his own (now deceased) mother-in-law out of money. To date in 2015, the Fraudster still owes over $9.4 million in restitution to his victims.A lot of political pundits have made allusions to the fact that the Clintons  and the Mezvinkys  behaviors are so similar, that it is what bonded the two. Be that as it may, the Clintons go to great lengths to never, ever, be seen or photographed with any of Chelsea s in-laws. So afraid is the Clinton Dynasty of being tarnished by the Mezvinkys that neither Ed nor his second wife and Marc s mother, Marjorie Sue Margolies-Mezvinsky, were allowed in any of Chelsea s wedding pictures.

 Watch This Mattress Company’s Impossibly Vile 9/11 Sale Commercial (VIDEO),"Miracle Mattress of San Antonio wants everyone to know that they ll never forget Sept. 11, 2001. To that end, they posted the most amazingly, disgustingly tone-deaf and just plain terrible commercial to commemorate the anniversary of the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil. It was cheerful, it talked about the Twin Towers and used them to promote discounts on all their mattresses, and then And then they took it too far. Way too far. So impossibly far that we can t even see it from the boundaries of decency with the Hubble Space Telescope.Because using a national tragedy to promote a sale isn t classless enough.Watch it for yourself (TRIGGER WARNING):It was posted to a parody page aimed at shaming Miracle Mattress up one side and down the other for this, and remains viewable there. It has been removed from social media elsewhere.Miracle Mattress has been shredded to confetti for this, to the point where they ve posted a letter of apology on their main Facebook page, and changed their background image to show part of that letter. That s not enough for some of the people on their page, though. Many of the comments below are from members of the military, people who were in NYC on that horrific day, and even some of the responders.They re rightfully angry and their comments are heart-wrenching. For them, and for anybody with the tiniest micron of a heart, the apology rings hollow and false and just plain isn t enough.         Miracle Mattress  last post on Facebook is a screenshot of a second letter from the owner, Mike Bonnano. The company has closed the doors of their store indefinitely, will remain silent through the 9/11 anniversary, and then will issue a formal statement next week.That will be of major comfort to the people who are pissed off, offended, and hurt by that video, we re sure. This will definitely cost the company business. It might push them out of business, and for a company that s so clueless that the owner didn t know his own daughter made that video, perhaps that s for the best.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",News,"September 10, 2016",2083
 Trump TERRIFIES THE HELL Out Of Dept. Of Energy With Invasive Questions About Current Employees,"Trump s transition team is certainly doing a good job of keeping things moving along, but that s about the only thing they re doing well. What they re busy doing, while keeping things humming along, is another story entirely. Trump s pick for head of the Environmental Protection Agency is enough to send alarm bells ringing, but then his transition team had to go and make things considerably worse.Trump s team has contacted the Department of Energy with some unusual requests that would worry pretty much anyone. They want to know who had attended the U.N. s climate summits over the last five years. As we all know, there was a major climate change summit in Paris at the end of 2015, and we eventually ended up signing onto the agreement that emerged, much to the dismay of climate deniers who want to derail all the progress we ve made as a global climate leader.Their questionnaire, which has 74 questions (more than many tests, employment exams, etc.), also asked who had attended any meetings on the social cost of carbon, which is what our government uses to determine the costs and benefits of new climate and energy regulations. They also want a list of all publications from employees who are at the 17 national laboratories run by the Dept. of Energy for the last three years. Dan Reicher, a professor at Stanford University, said: They re certainly sending an aggressive signal here with some of these questions and they need to be careful. Yeah well, Trump and his cronies, his lapdogs, and the people who are giving him blow jobs and sucking his balls don t really want to be careful. They want to prove they re on Cheetolini s side. Why? Likely because Trump is a massive climate denier, regardless of what he says now, and because everyone he s choosing to run the agencies in charge of both energy production and environmental protection are avid climate deniers.If you re not a climate denier, good luck keeping your job. Trump and his cabinet picks could undo every environmental regulation we ve implemented in the last, well, who knows? 20 years? 30? The people who oppose that, and the people who are just dying to sleep with King Cheeto, would rather perform fellatio than stick by the truth of climate change.Some employees at the Dept. of Energy feel like this is an  enemies list,  of sorts: When Donald Trump said he wanted to drain the swamp it apparently was just to make room for witch hunts and it s starting here at the DOE and our 17 national labs. Yup. Most likely. Energy and environmental policy are good places to start since not many people really think about those things. Care? Absolutely, but not think about on a daily basis, which is sad considering the fact that we still need this planet to survive, and if it changes faster than we can adapt, we ll all die.But who cares about that, right? Climate change is always happening, and it s not man-made because man can t be so arrogant as to thwart the Almighty Christian God, so trying to save the environment is dumb since businesses need profit and man will either survive or die anyway.Or that s how they sound.Anyway.The Dept. of Energy should be afraid because they might be the start of a government-wide purging of people who don t agree with every single syllable Trump utters, either in front of a mic or on his Twitter account. They ll be first, but who might follow?Featured image by Drew Angerer via Getty Images",News,"December 9, 2016",3419
OBAMA’S BAGS OF CASH? Trump Discovers $300 Million Spent Annually On “Ghost Soldiers” In Afghanistan [Video],"Do you remember the stories of bags of cash given to President Karzai in Afghanistan?

How could the DOD not check into this until recently?According to the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction, John Sopko, who recently sat down for an interview with Sharyl Attkinson of Full Measure, the ongoing problem may have been worse than anyone realized, but was being addressed by President Donald Trump s Pentagon. We ve been raising this concern about ghosts going back a number of years,  Sopko said.

 Conservative Conspiracy Theorist ARRESTED After Threatening To Kill Sandy Hook Parent,"Lucy Richards, a Tampa woman who believes lunatics like Alex Jones who say the Sandy Hook tragedy is a hoax, was arrested this week for threatening to kill a parent of one of the children who died in 2012. This is just the latest in the potentially long list of what we can expect to come from fake news conspiracies being spread by right-wing nutjobs.Richards started making threats back in January, saying things like  you gonna die, death is coming to you real soon,  according to court documents released on Wednesday. She also wrote,  Look behind you. It s death,  to the parent, who was identified as Len Pozner in a statement he released after Richards  arrest. Pozner s son Noah was the youngest victim of the Sandy Hook massacre.Pozner, who now resides in Florida and spends his time disproving these so-called  truthers,  said in his statement:We are comforted to know that the system is working to protect the victims of violent crime from re-victimization by potentially violent Hoaxers.Sadly, Lucy Richards is not the only one from this group of Sandy Hook  hoaxers  that has harassed or threatened Mr. Pozner. He s been dealing with this for years.According to The New York Times:The conspiracy theorists have criticized Mr. Pozner and his counterinvestigations of their work. Mr. Pozner has filed complaints with law enforcement, private companies, and the attorney general s office. He even wrote a 165-page book raising questions about a champion of the hoax theory according to a September article in New York Magazine. People don t understand what trolls are,  Pozner said,  If you don t feed them, they don t just go away. When Mr. Pozner asked a Florida Atlantic University professor, James F. Tracy, to stop posting photos of Noah, the professor sent him a certified letter asking for proof the boy existed.The professor, who was tenured, was soon fired and he blames Pozner.Professor Tracy didn t actually commit any crimes, no matter how disgusting his actions were, but Lucy Richards on the other hand   Richards committed 4 counts of felony threat transmission and if convicted will spend up to 20 years in prison.

WOW! KY Dem House Speaker Makes Insane Speech Following Crushing Defeat In Gov Race [Video],"State Reps Forced To Stand Awkwardly In BackgroundAt one point it appears as though someone approaches the two State Representatives who appear to be trapped behind the rambling, incoherent train wreck, Kentucy House Speaker and Democrat, Greg Stumbo and offers them an opportunity to get off the stage. This wealth accumulation in America has to cease.   Kentucky Republicans had a very good election day. Matt Bevin defeated Democrat Jack Conway to become only the second Republican Kentucky governor in four decades. Jenean Hampton won her quest for lieutenant governor, becoming the commonwealth s first African-American to hold a statewide office.  Rising Democratic star  State Auditor, Adam Edelen, was ousted by Republican state Rep. Mike Harmon, despite raising nearly $900,000 to Harmon s $37,000.Democrats held on to some seats, but the defeats were crushing in part because Conway was ahead in polling up to election day. With so many Democrats ousted from office or unable to win their campaigns, Kentucky House Speaker Greg Stumbo is one of the top-ranking Democrats still standing.He gave a speech that was striking for its odd content and rambling delivery. Flanked by state Reps. Martha Jane King and Jeff Greer, Stumbo discussed his thoughts on the political affiliation of Jesus and his view on what Scripture really is and how it influences politics. And the other thing I know is that if in fact the Bible is a book of parables, like I believe it is, think about this: Mary did not ride an elephant into Bethlehem that night,  he said to a restrained crowd.[ ] For entire story:The Federalist   h/t:Weasel ZippersHmmmm .I wonder where he got the idea America is beginning to think of the Democrats as the  Godless party?

HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER Makes “Shooting At Trump” Option For Answer On Multiple Choice Test,"EAG News  A Wyoming high school is under fire after parents exposed an online student quiz that offered  shooting at Trump  as one of the multiple choice answers.An unidentified English teacher at Jackson Hole High School gave students a multiple choice quiz on Thursday about George Orwell s novel  Animal Farm  that included a question that many are pointing to as an example of the district s  liberal bias,  the Jackson Hole News and Guide reports. Napoleon has a gun fired for a new occasion. What is the new occasion?  the quiz read.Possible answers included  He was shooting at Trump,   His birthday,   For completion of the windmill,  or  To scare off the attackers of Animal Farm. Jim McCollum told the news site he did a double-take when his son showed him a screenshot he took of the test. I had to read it two times,  McCollum said.  I was like,  Are you kidding me? McCollum, a Jackson Hole High School graduate and Trump supporter, shared the quiz on Facebook, where it was shared widely and generated a lot of angry comments. It was so inappropriate to show a name of a sitting president in that question,  he said.  To me, that is so wrong in light of the situation in our country and the divisiveness and all. He told the news site the incident is one of other examples of  liberal bias  in other classes at the school that make conservative students like son out to be  the outcast. He told me,  Dad, they crapped on everything I believe in,  McCollum said of his son.  Rylee is very patriotic, very supportive of our military and of our country  and is considering enlisting in the U.S. Marines.School officials eventually issued a statement about the quiz on Monday. (District) administration learned late yesterday that a quiz was administered to a class of high school students that contained an inappropriate answer to a multiple choice question. Administration is investigating this incident and verifying the information we have received,  the statement read. (The District) takes seriously threats of any kind, regardless of the intent. We apologize to the students, families, and community for this incident and will be addressing the issue with personnel. It s unclear what, if any, discipline the teacher may face.The incident occurred in the Teton County School District #1.According to The Washington Post:Last year, deeply conservative Wyoming voted for Trump by the widest majority of any state, 70 percent. In Teton County, Hillary Clinton got 60 percent, the only Wyoming county the Democrat won.Teton County is a wealthy ski and summer recreation destination. Residents include former Vice President Dick Cheney and his daughter, Republican U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney.In 2015, school administrators canceled an  America Day  tradition for homecoming in which students donned red, white and blue and rode around on a diesel truck to show their patriotism and love of country. Activities director Mike Hansen put the kibosh on the event because he alleged some students might get offended.The school s juniors and seniors didn t buy it, however, and many showed up to school decked out in stars and stripes, then paraded the diesel truck around the school parking lot at the end of the day, waving American flags. It s homecoming week and our school administration thought it was too  offensive  to have an America Pride Day! So this is my kids answer to that!  local parent Ted Dawson posted to Facebook with pictures of his kids in patriotic get-ups.  Where have we gone wrong!

 Trump Goes On Insane Rant About Female News Anchor Bleeding; Here’s Her Response (TWEETS),"It can easily be said that there is a madman who has been allowed to take residence in the White House.

ROMNEY CRITICIZES TEA PARTY CANDIDATE TED CRUZ ABOUT TOUGH RHETORIC ON IRAN AND CRUZ COMES OUT SWINGING: “You got clobbered [by Obama] because you didn’t have the guts to keep going.”,"A transcript from the Friday, July 31, 2015 Rush Limbaugh show. Rush is truly one of the most brilliant political analysts of our time. He proves it with this commentary on Mitt Romney and Ted Cruz:RUSH: Mitt Romney is out there ripping into Ted Cruz, and I made the observation that I can t recall a presidential candidate   losing presidential candidate   ripping presidential candidates in his own party in the next election cycle. I was trying to think, in the modern era, if there was an example of it. I couldn t think of one. It wasn t so much trying to think of Reagan s 11th commandment as I was thinking more about establishment Republican versus upstart Tea Party conservative.By the way, here s another thing: I ve been doing  In the course of show prep, I ve been doing just a voluminous amount of reading about the divide here between the establishment in Washington, both parties, and the Republican Party, what s happening with Trump and so forth. Now, I knew! I knew that the Democrats had elevated the Tea Party into being something horrible and giant and bad, negative. I had no idea Eh, that s not quite true. I didn t fully appreciate the extent to which the Republican Party has enmity for the Tea Party. The Washington establishment treats the Tea Party  They re genuinely afraid of it. Let me put it this way: They re genuinely afraid of it because of its size and its power, and the amazing thing about that is the Tea Party is not something about which is organized around an individual. I think this is why they fear it. It is genuinely bottom-up.It s an effervescent movement of average, ordinary people fed up with Washington, just totally fed up with government, totally fed up with what government is doing. Peggy Noonan has a piece today, and she says that the Tea Party and others, it s not hatred for government they have, it s contempt for government. But the Tea Party is genuinely feared, and it s genuinely feared because it is thought to be huge, and it s put the whole Republican establishment on defense.So, anyway, Ted Cruz  isn t backing off the tough rhetoric he s used to describe the Iran nuclear deal, despite criticism leveled by  Mitt Romney yesterday. Cruz  fired back at Romney in a Thursday radio interview   So Mitt Romney s tweet today said,  Gosh, this rhetoric is not helpful,  Cruz said.  John Adams famously said,  Facts are stubborn things.  Describing the actual facts is not using rhetoric; it is called speaking the truth.'  Cruz then fired another fact. Part of the reason that Mitt Romney got clobbered by Barack Obama is because we all remember that third debate where Barack Obama turned to Mitt and said,  I said the Benghazi attack was terrorism and no one is more upset by Benghazi than I am!  And Mitt, I guess listening to his own advice, said,  Well gosh, I don t want to use any rhetoric. So OK, never mind. I ll just kind of rearrange the pencil on the podium here,  Cruz said.  And he s right! We do remember that debate.I mean, Romney must have had three, different, slow-pitch curveballs, softballs, just tailor made for grand-slam home runs, and he just didn t even take a swing at them. Remember that? After the first debate, when Romney just cleaned Obama s clock, do you remember that? The Democrats and the media were all asking,  What happened to Obama? Oh my God, does he even want to be reelected?  They were scared to death because Romney just made mincemeat.After that one, it was like it never happened, almost like Romney felt guilty for doing it. Because he went into a defensive mode and did not do anything else that might offend or upset or irritate anybody. And it was clear that the consultants had gotten hold of him. Maybe they didn t have to. Maybe he believed it himself. But the consultants had gotten a hold of him and said,  Look, you can t keep criticizing the president. The independents don t like that! We re never going to win. We have to show we can cooperate. We have to show we can work with the Democrats!  So Romney shut up. But what Cruz s point is very simple (summarized):  What are you beating up on me for? I m not the enemy. I m not the Democrat Party. Why don t you start talking about them this way? They re the ones actually doing a deal that s going to put this country at risk. Why don t you say that?  Effectively what Cruz is saying is,  I m not the problem here, Mitt! And this isn t  rhetoric.  I m simply citing facts. So now people are starting to ask:  Is Cruz following in the Trump mold? Is Trump serving to show the way for other Republicans how to respond?  Well, maybe Trump is, but Cruz doesn t need to be shown. This is standard operating procedure for Cruz. I mean, it was just two weeks ago that he went to the floor of the Senate and accused the majority leader of lying to him face to face. Now he s firing back at Romney. But try this headline. Well, it s not a headline. It s a paragraph subhead. Both Obama and Romney have called Cruz s remarks inappropriate.  What has Cruz done? He s  maintained that [Obama] would become a leading state-sponsor of terror if the agreement it struck with Iran makes it past Congress. He and others have argued that Iran would use a windfall from sanctions relief to finance terror abroad.  He has said on that basis alone this deal ought not get done! And then Romney piped up and said in a tweet (paraphrased):  Gosh, this rhetoric isn t helpful. Gosh, this rhetoric isn t helpful! Cruz fired back:  You re telling me what s not helpful? You got clobbered by Obama for a reason! You got clobbered because you backed off. You got clobbered because you didn t have the guts to keep going.  So this is  I like this, folks. Whatever Trump s responsible for it or not.END TRANSCRIPTVia: RushLimbaugh.com",politics,"Aug 2, 2015",5778

The Nerve! Clinton Claims The VA Scandal Was No Big Deal,"Hillary Clinton has some nerve claiming that the VA scandal was not widespread. What does she know? She obviously doesn t know what she s talking about and has offended veterans once again   is she calling them liars? If it s the Republican  right wing conspiracy  then why is this a bipartisan cause that s using FACTS instead of sweeping criticisms? This woman has some nerve to make this claim after Dems blocked any help for our military or veterans.The VA scandal that left thousands of veterans on long waiting lists for care while officials received bonuses wasn t a really bid deal according to Hillary Clinton. She said on MSNBC that it wasn t as  widespread as it has been made out to be,  and then she went on to blame Republicans for failing to provide the VA with proper funding. It s all part of some plot to call for privatization.She said the problem is real, but cautioned that  it s not been as widespread as it has been made out to be  on MSNBC s  Rachel Maddow Show  on Friday.The former first lady blamed Republicans for using the issue as part of an  ideological agenda  and said they want the VA to  fail.   Now nobody would believe that from the coverage you see, and the constant berating of the VA that comes from the Republicans, in   in part in pursuit of this ideological agenda that they have,  Clinton said.  They try to create a downward spiral, don t fund it to the extent that it needs to be funded, because they want it to fail, so then we can argue for privatization.  Senate Democrats blocked a bill to fund the VA earlier this month in order to negotiate a larger budget deal. I m sure she left out the part about her party blocking VA funding so they could spend money on other things. Never mind that, or how President Obama is holding up a defense bill. President Obama is engaged in similar  hostage taking,  having just vetoed bipartisan defense legislation that, among other things, would pay the troops.Via: The Lonely Conservative",politics,"Oct 26, 2015",1976
WOW! Dem Rep Keith Ellison BLAMES Obama For Huge Democrat Losses: He’s “Put His Legacy In Jeopardy” [VIDEO],"Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN) said that President Obama bore some of the blame for Democrats  spectacular collapse in the 2016 election at an event at the University of Minnesota Wednesday.Ellison was quick to say that he voted for every radical piece of legislature that Barack Obama pushed for, but when it comes to uniting the party, it appears that the most narcissistic, self-serving president in history may have been much of a team player. Barack Obama could have been a better party leader, and I think that the fact that he wasn t has put his legacy in jeopardy,  Ellison said. Given that we   lost a lot of state house seats, governorships, secretaries of states, his true legacy is in danger,  Ellison continued.  And I don t think he can say that he wasn t part of those losses. NTKNetworkBarack Obama s not exactly a team player unless of course you re talking about the times that he worked with Al Sharpton and Eric Holder to divide our nation. When it came to promoting other Democrats however, Obama didn t have such a great track record.

REVEALED: The Dark Agenda Behind Globalization and Open Borders,"The T.I.N.A. Doctrine    There Is No Alternative  Brandon Smith Alt-MarketWhen people unfamiliar with the liberty movement stumble onto the undeniable fact of the  conspiracy  of globalism they tend to look for easy answers to understand what it is and why it exists. Most people today have been conditioned to perceive events from a misinterpreted standpoint of  Occam s Razor    they wrongly assume that the simplest explanation is probably the right one.In fact, this is not what Occam s Razor states. Instead, to summarize, it states that the simplest explanation GIVEN THE EVIDENCE at hand is probably the right explanation.It has been well known and documented for decades that the push for globalism is a deliberate and focused effort on the part of a select  elite;  international financiers, central bankers, political leaders and the numerous members of exclusive think tanks. They often openly admit their goals for total globalization in their own publications, perhaps believing that the uneducated commoners would never read them anyway. Carroll Quigley, mentor to Bill Clinton and member of the Council on Foreign Relations, is often quoted with open admissions to the general scheme: The powers of financial capitalism had (a) far-reaching aim, nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole. This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements arrived at in frequent meetings and conferences. The apex of the systems was to be the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland; a private bank owned and controlled by the world s central banks which were themselves private corporations. Each central bank  sought to dominate its government by its ability to control Treasury loans, to manipulate foreign exchanges, to influence the level of economic activity in the country, and to influence cooperative politicians by subsequent economic rewards in the business world.    Carroll Quigley, Tragedy And HopeThe people behind the effort to enforce globalism are tied together by a particular ideology, perhaps even a cult-like religion, in which they envision a world order as described in Plato s Republic. They believe that they are  chosen  either by fate, destiny or genetics to rule as philosopher kings over the rest of us. They believe that they are the wisest and most capable that humanity has to offer, and that through evolutionary means, they can create chaos and order out of thin air and mold society at will.This mentality is evident in the systems that they build and exploit. For example, central banking in general is nothing more than a mechanism for driving nations into debt, currency devaluation, and ultimately, enslavement through widespread economic extortion. The end game for central banks is, I believe, the triggering of historic financial crisis, which can then be used by the elites as leverage to promote complete global centralization as the only viable solution.This process of destabilizing economies and societies is not directed by the heads of the various central banks.  Instead, it is directed by even more central global institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the Bank for International Settlements, as outlined in revealing mainstream articles like Ruling The World Of Money published by Harpers Magazine.We also find through the words of globalists that the campaign for a  new world order  is not meant to be voluntary.  When the struggle seems to be drifting definitely towards a world social democracy, there may still be very great delays and disappointments before it becomes an efficient and beneficent world system. Countless people   will hate the new world order   and will die protesting against it. When we attempt to evaluate its promise, we have to bear in mind the distress of a generation or so of malcontents, many of them quite gallant and graceful-looking people.    HG Welles, Fabian Socialist and author of The New World Order In short, the  house of world order  will have to be built from the bottom up rather than f rom the top down. It will look like a great  booming, buzzing confusion,  to use William James  famous description of reality, but an end run around national sovereignty, eroding it piece by piece, will accomplish much more than the old-fashioned frontal assault.   Richard Gardner, member of the Trilateral Commission, published in the April, 1974 issue of Foreign Affairs The New World Order cannot happen without U.S. participation, as we are the single most significant component. Yes, there will be a New World Order, and it will force the United States to change its perceptions.    Henry Kissinger, World Action Council, April 19, 1994I could quote globalists all day long, but I think you get the general idea. While some people see globalism as a  natural offshoot  of free markets or the inevitable outcome of economic progress, the reality is that the simplest explanation (given the evidence at hand) is that globalism is an outright war waged against the ideal of sovereign peoples and nations. It is a guerrilla war, or fourth generation warfare, waged by a small group of elites against the rest of us.A significant element of this war concerns the nature of borders. Borders of nations, states and even towns and villages, are not just lines on a map or invisible barriers in the dirt. This is what the elites and the mainstream media would like us to believe. Instead, borders when applied correctly represent principles; or at least, that is supposed to be their function.Human beings are natural community builders; we are constantly seeking out others of like-mind and like-purpose because we understand subconsciously that groups of individuals working together can (often but not always) accomplish more. That said, human beings also have a natural tendency to value individual freedom and the right to voluntary association. We do not like to be forced to associate with people or groups that do not hold similar values.Cultures erect borders because, frankly, people have the right to vet those who wish to join and participate in their endeavors. People also have a right to discriminate against anyone who does not share their core values; or, in other words, we have the right to refuse association with other groups and ideologies that are destructive to our own Continue this story at Alt-MarketREAD MORE NWO NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire NWO Files",US_News,"October 27, 2016",6603

However, the DNC announced last week it was only donating $30,000 of that money. Furthermore, the groups getting the cash were openly pro-Democratic organizations Higher Heights, Emily s List, and Emerge America.After an event at the University of Wisconsin on Friday, Perez was asked by a tracker whether the DNC would return its contributions from Weinstein.IS THIS ALL THEY CAN SAY?

Target is making the right call. The current federal minimum wage, at $7.25, is extremely low compared to historic averages when adjusted for inflation.In fact, when you adjust for inflation, the minimum wage has steadily dropped since 1968.Republicans also try to make the case that most minimum wage workers have just entered the workforce and are not supporting families on their income (i.e. are students). This, too, is false. Less than half of minimum wage workers are aged 16-24. Additionally, tens of millions of hardworking Americans are paid nearly minimum wage, and would also be affected by proposed raises. It s not high schoolers with after-school jobs being paid minimum wage   it s anybody working a job at a business that can get away with shifting the burden of its employees to the public.And make no mistake   if you re a taxpayer, you re supporting underpaid employees. People working full-time (or part-time and can t get more hours) who are under the poverty line are eligible for benefits, and many choose to take them, being partial to eating and whatnot. That means if a business isn t paying their employees enough to eat, the government has to subsidize that employee. If a business can t afford a living wage, it has no right to exist.From Pew Research:While the idea of raising the minimum wage is broadly popular, a Pew Research Center survey this past August found clear partisan and racial differences in support. Overall, 52% of people favored increasing the federal minimum to $15 an hour, but that idea was favored by just 21% of Trump supporters (versus 82% of Clinton backers). And while large majorities of blacks and Hispanics supported a $15 federal minimum wage, 54% of whites opposed it.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"September 25, 2017",2386
 50 Top Republicans Pen BRUTAL Letter Warning Trump Would Be A National Security Disaster,"Donald Trump is nigh-universally recognized as a walking, talking, national security disaster. From The Donald s promise to our allies that we can t be trusted if he becomes President, to his threat to essentially throw out the Iran nuclear deal by modifying it until it is meaningless, to his almost salivating over the thought of pushing the  big red button  and unleashing our nuclear arsenal on, presumably, the first world leader to make him angry on Twitter, The Donald has succeeded in getting himself ranked as one of the top 10 global security risks.It s gotten to the point that fifty top Republican officials have now signed a letter acknowledging that Trump would put at risk our country s national security and well-being.  According to these Republicans, many of whom were top aides or cabinet members for George W. Bush (so they are well aware that a President can be a top national security risk), Trump lacks the character, values and experience  to be President and that he would be the most reckless president in American history.  The NY Times reports:The letter says Mr. Trump would weaken the United States  moral authority and questions his knowledge of and belief in the Constitution. It says he has  demonstrated repeatedly that he has little understanding  of the nation s  vital national interests, its complex diplomatic challenges, its indispensable alliances and the democratic values  on which American policy should be based. And it laments that  Mr. Trump has shown no interest in educating himself. None of us will vote for Donald Trump,  the letter states, though it notes later that many Americans  have doubts about Hillary Clinton, as do many of us. Among the most prominent signatories are Michael V. Hayden, a former director of both the C.I.A. and the National Security Agency; John D. Negroponte, who served as the first director of national intelligence and then deputy secretary of state; and Robert B. Zoellick, another former deputy secretary of state, United States trade representive and, until 2012, president of the World Bank. Two former secretaries of homeland security, Tom Ridge and Michael Chertoff, also signed, as did Eric S. Edelman, who served as Vice President Dick Cheney s national security adviser and as a top aide to Robert M. Gates when he was secretary of defense.Robert Blackwill and James Jeffrey, two key strategists in Mr. Bush s National Security Council, and William H. Taft IV, a former deputy secretary of defense and ambassador to NATO, also signed. He is unable or unwilling to separate truth from falsehood,  the letter says.  He does not encourage conflicting views. He lacks self-control and acts impetuously. He cannot tolerate personal criticism. He has alarmed our closest allies with his erratic behavior. All of these are dangerous qualities in an individual who aspires to be president and commander in chief, with command of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. Many of the signatories declined to add their names to a similar letter in March, but say Trump s promise that Russia would be  rewarded  for hacking his political enemies and his vow to be selective with which allies we defend caused many to change their minds.John B. Bellinger III, who served as Ms. Rice s legal adviser at the National Security Council and the State Department and who drafted the letter, says that  some  of the signers  will vote for  Clinton, and some will not vote, but all agree Trump is not qualified and would be dangerous. Trump indeed would be dangerous, not just to our allies but to average Americans thanks to his proposed Muslim ban and his unabashed attempts to prop up the Ku Klux Klan by warmly embracing their support   among, of course, other things.You can read the full letter below:  Donald Trump National Security Letter by German Lopez on ScribdFeatured image via Getty Images/Scott Eisen",News,"August 8, 2016",3870
UN AMBASSADOR SAMANTHA POWER Unmasked Hundreds of Trump Associates During 2016 Election [Video],"Adam Kredo of WFB asks the question we all want the answer to:  The fact that this information subsequently leaked to the press, I think raises even more questions about why a U.N ambassador over in Turtle Bay needs to unmask.  Samantha Power is a longtime Obama loyalist but her husband might be the key to all of this (see below).Power is believed to have made  hundreds  of unmasking requests to  identify individuals named in classified intelligence community reports related to Trump and his presidential transition team, according to multiple sources who said the behavior is unprecedented for an official in her position,  according to the Washington Free Beacon.Hannity asked Kredo how Power would ever have the authority to make the unmasking requests, and then asked whether this has ever happened previously to his knowledge. No, it s truly unprecedented,  Kredo said.  It s certainly odd, and I think the House Intelligence Committee, rightfully so, has subpoenaed her to find out what is going on here. Look, it s hundreds of unmasking requests in just the final year of the Obama administration. WE VE FOLLOWED THE  QUEEN OF GEORGE SOROS  AND HERE S WHAT WE KNOW:In 2005 06, Power worked as a foreign policy fellow in the office of U.S. Senator Barack Obama.In a 2007 interview, Power said that America s relationship with Israel  has often led foreign policy decision-makers to defer reflexively to Israeli security assessments, and to replicate Israeli tactics  The United States, she explained, had brought terrorist attacks upon itself by aping Israel s violations of human rights.Power has had her fair share of controversy, specifically after she was forced to resign from the president s 2008 campaign following negative remarks she made about Hillary Clinton.In an interview with The Scotsman during the heat of the 2008 presidential race, Power called Clinton a  monster. Power was soon back in with the Obama camp. Her husband is Obama s former Regulatory Czar Cass Sunstein.SUNSTEIN IS ONE SCARY GUY WHO WANTED GOVERNMENT TO INTRUDE ON YOUR PRIVACY:SALON reported:Cass Sunstein has long been one of Barack Obama s closest confidants. Often mentioned as a likely Obama nominee to the Supreme Court, Sunstein is Obama s head of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs where, among other things, he is responsible for  overseeing policies relating to privacy, information quality, and statistical programs.  In 2008, while at Harvard Law School, Sunstein co-wrote a truly pernicious paper proposing that the U.S. Government employ teams of covert agents and pseudo- independent  advocates to  cognitively infiltrate  online groups and websites   as well as other activist groups   which advocate views that Sunstein deems  false conspiracy theories  about the Government. This would be designed to increase citizens  faith in government officials and undermine the credibility of conspiracists. The paper s abstract can be read, and the full paper downloaded, here.Sunstein advocates that the Government s stealth infiltration should be accomplished by sending covert agents into  chat rooms, online social networks, or even real-space groups.  He also proposes that the Government make secret payments to so-called  independent  credible voices to bolster the Government s messaging (on the ground that those who don t believe government sources will be more inclined to listen to those who appear independent while secretly acting on behalf of the Government). This program would target those advocating false  conspiracy theories,  which they define to mean:  an attempt to explain an event or practice by reference to the machinations of powerful people, who have also managed to conceal their role.

UNREAL! RETIRING SENATOR IS 34TH VOTE TO CLINCH OBAMA WIN ON IRAN DEAL,"Obama s minions in the Democrat party never disappoint in their efforts to support this president on just about anything. Mikulski is retiring so what does she care? Sad day for America CALL HER Office Office of Senator Barbara Mikulski 503 Hart Senate Office Building Washington, DC 20510 (202) 228-1122Sen. Barbara Mikulski of Maryland became the crucial 34th vote Wednesday, declaring the agreement was the best way to curb Iran s nuclear ambitions.In a statement, Mikulski said she had studied the deal carefully, and had concluded it was the best way forward. I ve considered the alternatives very closely. But in the end, they don t present a more viable option to this deal,  she wrote.  No deal is perfect, especially one negotiated with the Iranian regime. I have concluded that this Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action is the best option available to block Iran from having a nuclear bomb. For these reasons, I will vote in favor of this deal. She also called on Congress to affirm its  commitment to the safety and security of Israel. Mikulski, 78, has been lauded by the Jewish community as a staunch supporter of Israel during her Senate career, the longest for a female in US history.Congress is to vote later this month on a resolution disapproving the deal, which is unanimously opposed by Republicans, who call it a dangerous giveaway to Iran.The backing from Mikulski, who is retiring next year, gives supporters the margin they need to uphold an Obama veto of a congressional resolution of disapproval if Republicans pass such a measure later this month.And it spells failure for opponents of the international agreement who sought to foil it by turning Congress against it. Leading that effort were Israel and its allies in the US, who failed to get traction after spending millions of dollars trying.Read more: Times of Israel ",Government News,"Sep 2, 2015",1847
"BATON ROUGE COP KILLER Had “Inspirational” YouTube Channel, Was Racist Member Of Farrakhan’s Nation Of ISLAM: “My Religion Is The Religion Of ‘Justice'” [VIDEO]","This cop killer was a hateful, racist sub-human. He not only hated white people and cops, he bragged about it. The scary thing is, much like ISIS, who has no trouble recruiting people with hate in their hearts, there are no shortage of people to carry out Obama s war on cops in America. These are terrorists and our very own  President  has inspired these people to act on their hate for Whites, for cops and for America. This, is Obama s real legacy The 29 year old ex-marine, Gavin Eugene Long, who ambushed and killed three unsuspecting Baton Rouge police officers on Sunday morning, hated those who did not share his skin-tone and harbored a particular hatred for the police. As revealed in the hours after the shootings, a Youtube account operated by Long under the handle I Am Cosmo where the alleged killer posted dozens of clips, provides insight into what motivated the young man to kill three police officers and wound three more on his 29th birthday.In the Youtube videos, Long rants against  crackers, and makes multiple references to the July 5th killing of Alton Sterling at the hands of police officers only five miles away from Sunday s attack. The videos also detail that Long is a member of the Nation of Islam, labelled a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center for its black supremacist and racist views towards Jews, Asians, and whites which the group s leaders argue have  sucked the blood from and exploited the black community.As Daily Caller details, the 29-year-old was a native of Kansas City, Missouri and was honorably discharged from the Marines in 2010 after reaching the rank of E-5. He preferred to go by the name Cosmo Ausar Setepenra rather than Gavin Eugene Long.In a video published on Thursday, the racist shooter says that  If I would have been there with Alton   Clap  before promoting a book that he wrote that discusses black liberation ideology.  I wrote it for my dark-skinned brothers,  said Long.  If you look at all the rebels like Black Panthers, Huey P. Newton, Malcolm X, and Elijah Muhammad, they was light-skinned. But we know how hard y all got it. https://youtu.be/kGuUq6eUoFwThe assailant also suggested that the black community should buy only from black-owned businesses rather than  working for the white people. In one video Long is heard lamented  working for the white people.  He encouraged one man riding in his vehicle as he filmed using a body camera to shop only at black-owned businesses. He brought up a hypothetical scenario in which a family member who wanted to buy carpet was forced to buy from non-black business owners saying    Who s she going to f  with? The cracker, the Arab, the Chinese? These Arabs, these Indians, they don t give two fucks about us,  said the shooter.Come to think of it, he may have a point.

 Mitt Romney Thinks Trump’s Tax Returns Will Show Mob Ties (VIDEO),"In a Facebook post on Wednesday, Mitt Romney discussed the fact that Donald Trump has vowed that he won t release his tax returns before the election. Romney insists that Trump must have a  bombshell  in his tax returns and that they might reveal something really nefarious and  disqualifying. This statement was in response to the bombshell Trump dropped on voters on Wednesday, in which he said he wouldn t release them. Trump has previously said that he would release his tax returns once the IRS is done auditing them. This claim is bizarre on its face. Here s Trump during a debate talking about the alleged audit:Tax experts are dubious:An audit by itself would not prevent Trump from releasing his tax returns, said David Cay Johnston, a Pulitzer prize winning tax author. It is up to an individual whether to disclose his or her tax return to the public, a lender or anyone else who wants to see it.Audits are rare. Overall, fewer than 1% of all individual returns are audited, although the rate is closer to 10% for tax filers with incomes over $10 million. The IRS says it expects to conduct 1.2 million individual audits this year, the lowest level in 11 years.Source: CNN MoneyThe IRS agrees: Federal privacy rules prohibit the IRS from discussing individual tax matters. Nothing prevents individuals from sharing their own tax information,  the IRS said in a statement released to NBC News.Source: NBC News Originally, the speculation was that Trump s tax returns would show that he s worth far less than his claim of $10 billion (or whatever he s saying today), but apparently Romney feels that it could be something much, much worse, and that Trump might have ties to the mob. Of course, that s not a huge leap to make, especially since Trump is in the construction business and in the casino business. Both industries are known for mob connections. That doesn t mean he has the mob connections, or more importantly, that he benefits from the mob connections, but it s not surprising that Romney could draw that conclusion.The irony, though, is that the tables have done a complete 180 from 2012 to now. Four years ago, Romney hadn t yet released his tax returns and it was Trump calling for transparency. Here s Romney being asked about his tax returns:Trump did eventually endorse the multi-millionaire, but not after saying this about Romney s tax returns:I think Mitt was hurt really very badly by this whole thing with the income tax returns. I believe he should have given them April 1, but I didn t think going into a little bit of detail without going into a lot of detail was positive thing. He ll come back. He has proven to be very resilient guy. He has been hurt a number of times by number of different things, he comes back. He really seems to be very tough and resilient. You have to hand it to him.Source: Fox NewsIt s somewhat surprising that Trump won t release his tax returns. He has famously said that he could shoot someone from the middle of Fifth Avenue and his followers would still love him. Sadly, that s probably true. A few billion less on his tax return can t make a difference, right? It s doubtful that even mob connections could damage him politically. Even white supremacist connections make his followers say  meh.  It could be that Trump s tax returns have something much worse, for him. They could point to illegal activity. This could be mob related, or it could be something else.Featured image via Ethan Miller/ Getty Images.",News,"May 11, 2016",3480
 Comedy Central’s Roast Of Rob Lowe HIJACKED As Comedians EPICALLY Roast Ann Coulter,"Comedy Central s roasts of various celebrities are well known by this point, and it s just as well known is that the roasts almost never focus exclusively on the person being roasted. This year s roast is all about Rob Lowe, and the roasters do go after him quite heartily and gleefully. However, it seems that Ann Coulter is also inexplicably a roaster this year, and the other roasters decided to burn her about as bad as they did Rob Lowe.Coulter is a Trump fangirl. She s also just about the most racist and hateful public figure in all of existence. She takes all of Trump s bizarre rhetoric 700 steps farther than it needs to go, while calling him out for not going far enough. These comedians don t really seem to like her all that much, and neither did the audience. They actually booed her for using her appearance there to promote her most recent book,  In Trump We Trust.  Oh, please.Variety did us all a favor and captured the following zingers delivered at Coulter s expense:Nikki Glaser:  The only person you will ever make happy is the Mexican who digs your grave. Peyton Manning:  I m not the only athlete up here. As you know, earlier this year, Ann Coulter won the Kentucky Derby. Davidson:  If you are here, Ann, who is scaring the crows away from our crops? Lowe:  After seeing your set tonight, we ve seen the first bombing you can t blame on a Muslim. Jeff Ross:  Ann is against gay marriage. What is your thinking on that? If I can t get a husband, they can t either? Jewel:  I do want to say as a feminist that I can t support everything that s been said tonight. But as someone who hates Ann Coulter, I m delighted. Rob Riggle:  If Ann Coulter is here, someone must have said her name three times. Beetlejuice! Beetlejuice! Beetlejuice! And perhaps the harshest, from Jimmy Carr:  Ann is one of the most repugnant, hateful, hatchet-face bitches alive. It s not too late to change, Ann. You could kill yourself. Coulter herself tried to play comedian, too, and threw out this, ahem, gem, which was probably the only  gem  she uttered all night: I want to welcome everybody to the Ann Coulter roast with Rob Lowe. That s about the only thing she s ever gotten even close to right, even if she did solidify the idea that this roast is all about her. Everything she thinks is twisted, bigoted, false, and delusional. As the old clich  goes, even a stopped clock is right twice a day. Coulter, however, is right considerably less frequently than that.These are just a few of the jokes various Rob Lowe roasters shot her way, despite the fact that she was likewise a roaster, but has no connection to Lowe. Lowe explained her appearance by saying that they need all flavors at these roasts in order to make them work, and that s why she was there.Whatever the reason, though, Variety insinuates that her entire performance fell far more flat than anybody else s. Poor, poor Ann. Our hearts bleed for her and how stupid she ll look on Labor Day, which is when this will air.Featured image by Christopher Polk/Getty Images",News,"August 28, 2016",3039

You could play  Let me count the ways  for days with this president but here s one that s a doozy: President Obama has budgeted $17,613 for each of the estimated 75,000 Central American teens expected to illegally cross into the United States this year, $2,841 more than the average annual Social Security retirement benefit, according to a new report.The total bill to taxpayers: $1.3 billion in benefits to  unaccompanied children,  more than double what the federal government spent in 2010, according to an analysis of the administration s programs for illegal minors from the Center for Immigration Studies. The average Social Security retirement benefit is $14,772.The report notes that the president s budget, facing congressional approval, includes another $2.1 billion for refugees, which can include the illegals from Central America, mostly Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.What s more, the administration is also spending heavily on a program with the United Nations to help the illegal minors avoid the dangerous trip by declaring them refugees and handing them a plane ticket to the U.S. where, once here, they get special legal status.The report, titled  Welcoming Unaccompanied Alien Children to the United States,  is a deep dive into the administration s evolving efforts to let hundreds of thousands of mostly 16- and 17-year-old males settle in the country.Read more: WT ",politics,"May 2, 2016",1496

What Neighbor Said About MUSLIM MAN ID’d As London Terrorist Speaks Volumes About The Danger Of “Islamic Non-Assimilation” [VIDEO],"The terrorist who killed three people and injured dozens in Westminster on Wednesday was a married 52-year-old living with his family in an inner city suburb of Birmingham, according to police and a neighbour.Khalid Masood was born in Kent on Christmas Day 1964 and was described by a neighbor in Winson Green on Thursday as  very calm  and part of a  very reserved family . But in fact the man who crashed a rented Hyundai into dozens of people on Westminster Bridge and stabbed PC Keith Palmer to death was a violent convicted criminal with multiple offenses to his name, including assaults, grievous bodily harm, possession of offensive weapons and public order offenses.His first conviction was in November 1983 for criminal damage and his last conviction was in December 2003 for possession of a knife, according to Scotland Yard, who finally named him on Thursday afternoon. They were a nice family   very reserved,  said his neighbour Iwona Romek, a factory worker, who confirmed his identity to the Guardian.  He was very calm. I saw the photos on the TV and knew it was the man who lived here. The attack in Westminster came out of the blue not only for police, who stressed he had never been convicted of any terrorism offenses, but also for some who knew him in Birmingham, where he and his family lived on the modern Quayside estate about a mile from the city centre.However, he was once  investigated in relation to concerns about violent extremism .

Nancy s even more bizarre than usual behavior has led a lot of Americans to question her mental capacity and wonder if she s one of the members who s receiving the medications to treat  serious health problems ?Something is clearly wrong with Nancy Pelosi. Why is everyone in Washington DC and in the media ignoring her bizarre and incoherent interviews that leave viewers wondering how in the world she is fit to serve. American Mirror   During her recent weekly press conference, the House Minority Leader was seen stumbling over words, uttering gibberish, staring blankly at reporters, and on at least two occasions, suffering from face spasms.

FATHERS OF SONS MURDERED By Illegal Aliens Have Brutal FATHER’S DAY Message For Paul Ryan,"US Citizens should never have to beg members of Congress to put the safety and security of their families before the donors who support their campaigns. The fact that Congress has allowed our current illegal crisis to spin this far out of control is unforgivable. Border Agents who spend years training to apprehend illegal aliens who cross our borders are not only being told to stand down by the Obama regime, they are also being asked to stand by and watch these aliens being transported to cities across America in a coordinated effort to populate red states with Democrat voters. This Father s Day, fathers whose sons were murdered by illegal aliens are calling on House Speaker Paul Ryan to resign   describing his policies as  treasonous  and taking particular objection to Ryan s recent attempts to undermine Donald Trump s proposals to enforce U.S. immigration law. I would invite Speaker Ryan to forsake spending Father s Day with his kids to come down here to Houston and visit the place I will spend every Father s Day for the rest of my life  my American son s grave. This way Speaker Ryan can see first hand what pandering to the cheap illegal labor lobby means to Americans who can t afford to put a security fence up around their house,  said Dan Golvach.Golvach s 25-year-old son, Spencer, was murdered by an illegal alien. Spencer was shot in the head while stopped at a red light. The best thing Ryan could do to protect his family from what my family is experiencing is resign today!  Golvach added.  His policies are not only treasonous to us, they are also treasonous to any American that ever happens to be sitting at a red light like Spencer was. This wasn t Syria or Iraq. It was the neighborhood I grew up in. Do your kids ever sit at red lights, Mr. Speaker? Billy Inman, whose 16-year-old son was murdered by an illegal alien, said that it was a  disgrace  for Paul Ryan to suggest that he may sue a President Trump for using executive authority to pause Muslim migration. He s more upset with Trump than he is about what happened to our families,  Inman said.  If Ryan sues Trump on the Muslim ban, we could sue him and most of our elected officials for not stopping illegal aliens from crossing the southern border. In addition to Father s Day, this week marks the 16th anniversary of the death of Inman s child. Inman s 16-year-old son Dustin was murdered while he and his family were on their way to celebrate an early Father s Day family fishing trip. An illegal alien rear-ended the family s vehicle at over 60 mph. Dustin s parents, Billy and Kathy, were both knocked unconscious. They were unable to attend their son s funeral because they were in accident-induced comas for weeks after their son s death.Dustin s killer remains at large today.Inman sees it as symbolic that Donald Trump   the first national politician to make their family feel heard   launched his presidential campaign on the same day Inman lost his son fifteen years ago. I d like for Ryan to try wearing my shoes for a week. I don t think he d make it a day,  Inman said while discussing the anguish he and his wife go through daily. Ryan is just one of Obama s puppets. I don t consider him a Republican,  said George Wilkerson, whose 18-year-old son Joshua was tied up, beaten, strangled, set on fire, and tortured to death by his illegal alien classmate while he was on his way home from school.Wilkerson described Ryan s policies as  treasonous  and voiced his own frustrations about Ryan s tone:His tone is totally against Americans as far as I m concerned. He s been paid by the taxpayers, but he hasn t done anything for them. He s been there for two decades. He s not doing his job. He s not looking out for Americans. He s doing more for foreign citizens than he is for his own American citizens.Addressing Ryan s recent denunciations of Trump s immigration proposals, Wilkerson said,  Ryan doesn t speak for me. He hasn t done anything to help us. By contrast, Wilkerson said that Trump has helped his family, but that  it s starting to get harder when you have people like Ryan standing up and telling the American public that Trump is wrong on this issue. Paul Ryan has a two-decade history of pushing open borders immigration policies and fighting to maintain illegal immigrants  access to benefits paid for by U.S. taxpayers. Ryan s 2015 omnibus spending bill fully funded sanctuary cities; and earlier this week, Ryan seemed to suggest that the reason the House has not pushed Kate s Law   named for Kate Steinle   is because he s opposed to  clogging up our jails  with illegal alien drunk drivers. Ryan s immigration agenda that caters to his GOP donors, who benefit from illegals being here, is totally wrong,  Wilkerson said.  We re in tough times. For him to sit there and not be for Americans and for America is absurd  I m supporting Paul Nehlen. Absolutely, I want Paul Nehlen to take Paul Ryan s place . We need more people like Nehlen.

HEARTWARMING: Support For Socialism On College Campuses Much Less Than Media Would Like Americans To Believe,"Proof that sanity still exists on college campuses.Capitalists on campus won t have to stand by any longer while communists and socialists celebrate May Day, as they ve appropriated the holiday. Turning Point USA offered free materials to students with a comprehensive plan for the Socialism Sucks Day of Action.More than 500 campuses are participating in the counter-celebration on Monday.  I want the American Dream. Socialism only takes away my chance to start a multi-billion company in my apartment,  Turning Point USA s Josh Thifault declared.  It s important that we stick to the values that made our country great   capitalism and freedom. Some students have caught on to what Venezuela has learned the hard way. Venezuela s brewing company, responsible for 80 percent of its beer supply, began to shut down its last plant on Friday, according to The Wall Street Journal. In addition to how Venezuelans  like to celebrate,  there is concern because the beer factory also provided jobs. The country has suffered food shortages and power outages, and can no longer afford to print its own money. Venezuelans are also learning that  socialism sucks  and are petitioning to recall President Nicol s Maduro.In stark contrast to the student activities in other parts of America, May Day was celebrated with violence in Seattle. At least nine were arrested for pelting officers with rocks, batons, and molotov cocktails, which injured at least five officers.

 Watch Karl Rove Get Proven Wrong About His Virginia Prediction In Less Than Five Seconds (VIDEO),"We ll never forget Karl Rove s meltdown at Fox News when President Obama was re-elected in November of 2012. It was a moment when he simply couldn t wrap his head around Fox declaring Obama the victor and he was in complete denial. It was as though his schemes to prevent Obama from winning didn t work, and now it seems as if his embarrassing moments didn t cease there.Now, in a new   and pretty damn embarrassing   video of him trying to say his clear establishment choice of Marco Rubio might still pull out a victory in Virginia, he s proven wrong in literally less than five seconds.When Chris Wallace asked Rove what he thought about the race in Virginia, Rove replied: Well, I think this race is going to continue to tighten However, it was then that Rove was abruptly cut off with Wallace saying: Wait, wait, hold on just a second  Apparently we ve got a call in Virginia, so you can tell us after we get the call. And that  call,  as we all know by now, was for Donald Trump being declared the winner. Wallace then asks Rove while laughing: Karl, tell me, what does that mean for Marco Rubio and Donald Trump? What does it mean? It means Rubio can t win is what it means, and the GOP s only shot at an establishment candidate just went out the window. Sure, Rubio won Minnesota, but that s the only state he s won so far in the Republican primary battle. The chances of him securing the nomination are little to none.Rove, much like with what happened during his meltdown in 2012, is likely in utter disbelief. His puppet strings to control Republican elections are no longer working and he s probably in a deep panic.

 Rape Apparently Doesn’t Earn Jail Time Anymore – Even If The Victim Is Only Two Years Old,"If you are a young white male in America, apparently you are free to stick your genitalia into whomever you please without having to fear that you will end up in prison. Consent be damned. Proof of this is the disgusting case of an Iowa teen who raped a toddler   on camera   and was given a free pass when he was finally hauled in front of a judge for his repulsive crimes.Kraigen Grooms has admitted to raping the 2-year-old in April of 2013 when he was 16 years old. Not only did he rape the small child, but he did it on camera so he could livestream the sexual assault for another pervert to watch online. Investigators believe that the attack was premeditated, and also that he had plans to rape a 3-year-old boy in the same manner.Grooms was arrested in March 2014, when he was 17. Initially, he was charged with second-degree sexual abuse, a felony that could have put him in prison for 25 years. However, after spending two years in a juvenile detention center and county jail, he cut a deal and pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of engaging in a lascivious act with a child in July. This week, Judge Randy Degeest handed Groom, who also goes by the alias Kraigen Simmers, a 10-year suspended sentence and sent him home.This means that he will see absolutely no prison time for raping a 2-year-old. Let that sink in for a minute.This is just the most recent in a string of high-profile sexual assault cases that have ended with the rapist getting a slap on the wrist and being sent on his way. The most well-known of these cases being that of Brock Turner, who raped an unconscious woman behind a dumpster and was given just six months in jail, but ended up only serving three before being released.Is there any question that anyone who rapes a toddler   a f*cking toddler   should be behind bars until hell freezes over? Is there any question that America s rape culture has spiraled completely out of control when you can rape a 2-year-old, on camera, livestream it on the internet, and not end up in prison?Featured image via KTVO screen capture",News,"September 14, 2016",2057
 Democratic Senator Joins #THERESISTANCE: Says Trump Stole Obama’s SCOTUS Seat (DETAILS),"We all remember when Justice Antonin Scalia died last year, leaving a vacancy on the United States Supreme Court. As a result of his death, President Barack Obama did his job and nominated a qualified federal judge to replace Scalia on the Supreme Court, Merrick Garland.Garland was a centrist, and a completely uncontroversial nominee for the land s highest court. However, Mitch McConnell decided that his goal was to obstruct President Obama, and he and the rest of the Republicans in the Senate decided not to meet with Judge Garland, and to give him no hearing and no vote. Now that we have a new president in Donald Trump, a right-wing extremist approved by far-right activist groups like the Heritage Foundation has been nominated in one Neil Gorsuch. To that end, Democrats are taking to the streets as they have been doing since Trump s election to pressure their elected Senators to oppose Trump s pick.One Democratic Senator, Jeff Merkley (D-Oregon) has said that he will defend and keep open the Supreme Court seat that was effectively stolen from President Obama. Merkley says via Twitter:Not only is this a stolen seat, but @realDonaldTrump has nominated a far right extremist. Unacceptable. https://t.co/9bkw4QODXD pic.twitter.com/iVHDdb2Pn9  Senator Jeff Merkley (@SenJeffMerkley) February 1, 2017Part of the statement reads: This strategy of packing the court, if successful, could threaten fundamental rights in America, including workers  right to organize, women s reproductive rights, and the rights of ordinary citizens to have their voices heard in elections rather than being drowned out by the corrupting influenceof dark money from the richest Americans. If President Trump were serious about healing the divisions in America and undoing the damage wrought by Senate Republicans last year, he could have named Merrick Garland to fill this seat. Garland is a centrist jurist who is respected on both sides of the aisle. Instead, he doubled down on division by picking an ideological and extreme nominee to satisfy the far right. Senator Merkley is right. The Court should not be packed with far-right   or, for that matter, far-left- ideologues. It should be filled with thoughtful, intellectual jurists who will not let personal opinions supercede the rule of law. That means nothing to the GOP, though; they just want their anti-worker, anti-poor, anti-gay, anti-immigrant, anti-woman agenda pushed through   damage to the nation s highest court be damned.In short, Merkley is urging his Democratic colleagues in the United States Senate to stand up to Republican obstruction, to make them look as bad as possible, and to save the Court from far-right ideologues who would destroy and roll back rights for all Americans except the rich, straight, white, and male a century.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"February 1, 2017",2841

 Debbie Wasserman Schultz Refuses To Debate Primary Challenger,"Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz s career is in jeopardy as a wave of resentful backlash in the Democratic Party over corrupt politics has affiliated her with everything that is wrong with establishment politics. Her poor leadership and lack of impartiality as Chair of the Democratic National Committee has disenfranchised millions of Democrats around the country, and has inspired thousands of progressive independents to not only support Senator Bernie Sanders for president, but her Democratic Primary Challenger, Tim Canova, as well.Refusing to take money from corporations or Super PACs, Mr. Canova has raised over $550,000 in the first quarter of 2016 from small donations averaging $20 each. Ms. Wasserman Schultz s flailing public image began its downward spiral after allegations surfaced she rigged the debate schedule of the Democratic Primaries to shield Hillary Clinton, on whose campaign she served as co-chair in 2008, from exposure.Now Debbie Wasserman Schultz is shielding herself from exposure by refusing to debate her Democratic primary challenger. On April 11th, Tim Canova tweeted a video clip of a Debbie Wasserman Schultz s District Director, Jodi Bock Davidson, swatting a cell phone out of one of Mr. Canova s campaign staffers hand after asking Debbie Wasserman Schultz if she would agree to a debate. Most staffers of politicians would have lost their job after such an incident, but Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who is no stranger to dirty politics, most likely applauded the response. Mr. Canova told a local South Florida newspaper he has sent three letters to the Debbie Wasserman Schultz campaign requesting to schedule a debate and has yet to receive any response. He has also started a petition on his campaign website for Debbie Wasserman Schultz to debate him. Debbie Wasserman Schultz continues to remain silent regarding his inquiries. She has often dodged questions about her primary opponent, hoping his surge will go away on its own if she ignores it. She told the Miami Herald Tim Canova won t change her campaign strategy, which makes little sense as she has never been challenged in her Democratic Primary since she entered Congress in 2004 until now, and her congressional district consists overwhelmingly of Democrats. It s no different than any other election I have. I have been on the ballot virtually every time. I do the same thing no matter whether I have primary opposition,  she said in the interview.Ms. Wasserman Schultz also dodged a question regarding why she thinks Tim Canova has gained the popularity he has. I really don t know,  answered Ms. Wasserman Schultz.  I am focused as I usually do on my own campaign, doing the best job I can to represent my constituents and that s my first responsibility is to do my job in Congress, to help elect a Democratic president and to make sure that in running for re-election people know the work I have done on their behalf. I m not remotely paying attention to what my opponent does. Apparently, not remotely paying attention to her opponent is synonymous with ignoring their requests to debate so voters can grasp a sense of where the two candidates differ on important issues to the constituency base. Ms. Wasserman Schultz s failure to engage with Tim Canova in a debate setting is undemocratic and sets a terrible example for the rest of the Democratic Party from its own Chair.Featured image via Flickr",News,"April 13, 2016",3416

MSNBC: “The Trump ‘Resistance’ has to become a church that seeks converts” [Video]," Persuasion is so important The Resistance has to become a church a church that seeks converts Huh??? This guy is allowed to spew his propaganda like he s an expert on Americans. Unreal! Did anyone else out there have to listen to that a few times to let it sink in?American Mirror reports:Despite Trump s obvious successes implementing campaign promises like tax cuts, rooting out ISIS, and bringing back jobs, Giridharadas believes  the resistance  has been effective in  protecting our institutions  in 2017. When you think about 2017, I think resistance was incredibly important, frankly, from my point of view. This president shattered every Democratic norm that people on both sides take for granted,  he alleged.  But if the movement that has done such a good job in 2017 at protecting our institutions only protects our institutions, I think they are going to miss an opportunity. The plan for progressives, Giridharadas argues, should be to take the resistance movement to people who allegedly don t like them, tell those folks their way of thinking is wrong, and convince them to join forces against the president. The same president who just cut their taxes.Notice how not one person on the panel refuted what he said! No fair and balanced here!",politics,"Dec 29, 2017",1256
 Hillary’s Latest Challenge To Progressives Is One That Needs To Be Taken Very Seriously (VIDEO),"Appearing on Face the Nation this past Sunday, Hillary Clinton was posed a question by host John Dickerson surrounding voters and how many want what they want, even when it comes to their candidate of choice. Dickerson insinuated that Hillary may be trying to get Bernie Sanders out of the race. However, when it comes down to who is going to win the nomination, many voters are undoubtedly going to be disappointed, because their candidate was not the one chosen. Yet, those voters will still have a voice, a voice that needs to be heard, and a message that needs to be spread far and wide.Hillary s response was honest, clear, to the point, and one that needs to be heard by every progressive everywhere who doesn t want to see the nation fall into the hands of Donald Trump. She said: I m three million votes ahead of Senator Sanders, nearly 300 pledged delegates ahead of him. He has to make his own mind up.But I was very heartened to hear him say last week that he is going to work seven days a week to make sure Donald Trump doesn t become president. And I want to unify the party. I see a great role and opportunity for him and his supporters to be part of that unified party, to move into not just November to win the election against Donald Trump, but to then govern based on the progressive goals that he and I share.We both want to raise the minimum wage. We both understand you have got to rein in bad actors on Wall Street and in corporate America to make sure they don t wreck Main Street. We have a lot of the same goals. And I hope we can unify around them. And she s absolutely correct. While the means to achieve some of the goals are different, the goals, nonetheless, are pretty much the same. While Bernie wants to overhaul health care and education in one fell swoop, Hillary wants the same things, but done over time. It s all about unifying behind the message and making sure we get there somehow, because if Donald Trump is to become president, or we can t manage to turn Congress blue again, honestly, it won t really matter who is president. Everything that needs to get done would be virtually impossible (see also: President Barack Obama with Republican Congress).No matter who the Democratic candidate for president is, it s time to unite behind them with the common goal of progress for the greater good, not just the few on top. Let s do this, progressives.Watch the whole segment from Face the Nation here:Featured Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images",News,"May 9, 2016",2482
 WATCH: Liberal Redneck Completely Demolishes Ted Cruz (VIDEO),"Yesterday, Trae Crowder, otherwise known as the Liberal Redneck, released an awesome YouTube comedy segment celebrating the demise of Ted Cruz.After his devastating loss in Indiana on May 3, Cruz solemnly resigned from the republican presidential primary race. While a few of his supporters booed at the announcement, the overwhelming majority of Americans were anything but sad to see Cruz drop out.Crowder devoted a short segment to the topic, beginning his monologue by announcing that  everyone s favorite murder-lizard has dropped out of the race. He goes on to recite the story of how Ted Cruz came to run for president, explaining: The Cruz family spent hours praying about about whether or not he should run, until god came down and spoke to his wife directly and said he should. Continuing with the story, he says  and so Ted hit his knees and offered himself up and said  I m your servant lord, use me in this as you see fit. Now that Ted has admitted that there is no possible way he can ever become president, Crowder surmises what this means, saying: To Ted, the use that his lord picked out for him was to completely destroy the republican party as we know it, while getting dusted by a carny-handed mango man. It s comedy, but the Liberal Redneck makes some great points in the segment, honing in on the message that Cruz s abject humiliation sends to right wing Christian extremists.That message is clearly  ya ll have lost. Crowder points out that Cruz could not beat a guy  who could come out tomorrow and announce Hulk Hogan as his running mate. But the ultimate message sent to the Christian right by Cruz s butt- spanking is that we re done with this. Crowder sums it up by saying: We re done with you wasting our time on trivial bullshit like laws about who uses what bathroom and how gay a cake s allowed to be before you gotta call a prayer circle. We re done. Watch the video below, courtesy of Liberal Redneck via YouTube. Featured image via video screen capture via Trae Crowder on Youtube",News,"May 7, 2016",2016
 Trump: Obama Just Looks Anti-Cop (VIDEO),"After the horrific murder of three police officers in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, President Obama gave a heartfelt speech   one that could have been given by any politician   condemning the  cowardly and reprehensible attack  against those who  put their lives on the line for ours every day.  Obama declared that  justice will be done. That, though, wasn t convincing enough for Trump, who stated in a Fox News interview that somehow, Obama must be in collusion with the murderers because of his  body language. After Fox & Friends host Steve Doocy read Donald Trump a statement from a Cleveland police union president   which accused Obama of having  blood on his hands    Trump replied,  Well, it s true. I watch the president and sometimes the words are okay, but you just look at the body language and there s something going on. Source: NY MagazineHere s the video:When the hell did Donald Trump become a body language expert? Oh, he isn t.  Body language  is nothing but code. President Obama is black. To racists, and Trump, that means that he s anti-cop and he must be a member of the Black Panthers, just as all Muslims are terrorists and all Mexicans are rapists.For decades, and probably centuries, part of the country s narrative was that cops and black people don t mix. Who can blame the African-American community, really? The justice system has been rigged against them from the start.Of course, white people turn that around to prop up the image of black people as criminals; they only have problems with the justice system because they are lawbreakers. Of course, that s not true (more on that in a minute), but that doesn t stop those on the right, including their leader, Donald Trump, from playing that particular race card with the highly educated African-American President of the United States, who must hate cops, simply because he has black skin.Here are the ugly facts, and they don t bode well for the justice system:If I were African-American, I d be pissed, but Obama is the President of the entire United States, a fact that has made some civil rights leaders, like Dr. Cornel West, turn on him. Sure, Obama doesn t deny his race, but he knows injustice wherever he sees it, and the shootings of cops was unjust.  There was nothing in his  body language  but weariness from our seemingly increasing rash of violence.See for yourself:As for Trump, his rhetoric is only ginning up the violence, all while the President tries his hardest to soothe a nation being driven to crisis level, partly because of Trump.Featured image via Drew Angerer at Getty Images.

 Second-Largest U.S. Paper Now Wants Readers To Decide If Trump’s Lies Are Lies (VIDEO),"Donald Trump is a consummate liar. He lies so much that it appears that his strategy is to tell enough lies that there s no way the media fact checkers can keep up. Well, the second largest paper in the country, the Wall Street Journal, has thrown in the towel. Their editor-in-chief, Gerard Baker, says that determining if Trump is lying is no longer their job and that it will be up to us. I d be careful about using the word,  lie.   Lie  implies much more than just saying something that s false. It implies a deliberate intent to mislead,  Baker told Chuck Todd on Meet the Press on Sunday.As an example, Baker cited one of Trump s more outrageous lies: When he claimed that thousands of Muslims in New Jersey gathered on rooftops to celebrate 9/11. Baker noted that the WSJ investigated his claim and found it baseless. I think it s then up to the reader to make up their own mind to say,  This is what Donald Trump says. This is what a reliable, trustworthy news organization reports. And you know what? I don t think that s true.  I think if you start ascribing a moral intent, as it were, to someone by saying that they ve lied, I think you run the risk that you look like you are, like you re not being objective,  he said.Source: Think ProgressHere s the video:The Wall Street Journal was purchased by News Corp in 2007. They are the same company that owns Fox News. Fox News, with its previous  We Report, You Decide  motto, deserves much of the blame for the fact that the media no longer does its job and instead relies on the  both sides  fallacy in covering real news. For example, there is only one legitimate side when discussing climate change, yet Fox has somehow convinced Americans that it s up for debate.Despite Fox s insistence that they present both sides of the story, they don t, and they are hardly beacons of truth. According to reports, about 60 percent of the facts Fox reports are complete lies and Fox viewers are far more likely to vote Republican than are other cable news watchers.While Fox News targets voters, the Wall Street Journal targets the business world. If Trump s lies go unchecked on Wall Street, it could wreak havoc with our financial markets.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video ",News,"January 1, 2017",2248
 President Obama Says He Believes The Affordable Care Act Will Survive Trump (VIDEO),"The president says he doesn t think Obamacare is going anywhere just yet. In an interview on ABC s This Week, Obama said he doesn t think the Affordable Care Act will be fully repealed quite like Republicans hope   and millions of Americans fear.President Obama said that although there is definitely the  risk  of a full repeal, he simply doesn t think the GOP can come up with a viable replacement plan. After all, he explained with amusement, they have been trying to do so for seven full years and have always failed. But when asked directly if he thought his signature health care legislation would survive, the president said he had faith that the ACA would endure. I think it will,  he said.  It may be called something else. And as I said, I don t mind. If in fact the Republicans make some modifications,  Obama continued. Some of which I may have been seeking previously, but they wouldn t cooperate because they didn t want to make the system work, and re-label it as Trumpcare, I m fine with that. Obama said he isn t worried about having his name attached to the ACA, he is worried about the millions of Americans who depend on the legislation for their medical care. He noted all the letters he gets from real people whose lives have literally been saved because of Obamacare and said that this is what matters to him. This is his legacy, he insisted, not having his name stamped on it.Republicans are still bound and determined to repeal Obamacare and replace it with  something better.  However, as Obama points out, this isn t necessarily what the American people want. He notes that many Trump voters have said they never really believed that Donald Trump would take away their health care. Obama is hopeful that the will of the American people can keep the ACA around for a long time to come, even if it is called Trumpcare.Watch what President Obama had to say about Obamacare today, here:[ad3media campaign= 1414 ]Featured image via Ron Sachs-Pool/Getty Images",News,"January 8, 2017",1981

"WIKILEAKS: CLINTON CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN Held 75,000 Shares In Putin-Connected Energy Company"," The disclosure that Clinton Chair John Podesta transferred his shares in Putin-backed Joule Unlimited to an anonymous holding company when he joined the Obama Administration is extremely concerning Hillary Clinton s campaign chairman John Podesta s membership on the executive board of an energy company, Joule Unlimited, which received millions from a Putin-connected Russian government fund, also included  75,000 common shares,  according to an email exchange uncovered by the Wikileaks hacks. In the newly-uncovered email exchanged under the subject  Podesta Outstanding Docs for Joule,  Eryn Sepp, who was an assistant to Podesta at the Center for American Progress, forwarded a message to Podesta from Mark C. Solakian, who was Senior Vice President and General Counsel at Joule Unlimited Technologies, Inc. It is my understanding that John transferred the resulting 75,000 common shares from the option exercise to the Leonidio LLC.,  Slovakian wrote in a January 2014 email, referencing the Delaware-based holding company.  As such, we would need to edit the Transfer of Share Agreement to reflect the transfer of 75,000 common shares to the LLC.

 Half The World’s Salmon Supply Threatened As Trump’s EPA Withdraws Alaskan Mining Restrictions,"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency gave the go-ahead on Friday for a massive copper and gold mining operation to seek permits to mine the headwaters of an Obama-era protected world-class fishery in southwest Alaska.After an agreement through a court settlement, the EPA will start withdrawing restrictions on mining development in the Bristol Bay region, a pristine Alaskan fishery that provides the world with half of its sockeye salmon.This unfortunate agreement comes only four months after Trump came into office, which the Pebble mine supporters hoped would be their ticket to big money through Trump s promises of environmental deregulation.Environmental rights groups are worried this agreement will act as a dangerous precedent for industry to challenge the EPA in court on environmental issues they previously wouldn t have gone after during the Obama Administration. It obviously sends a psychological message to big mining companies that if they were nervous about getting permits in the past   that this is their golden opportunity to get their mine through the process.  said Brett Harti, the government affairs director for the center for biological Diversity environment group.It s being called a  backdoor deal  by critics and a  slap in the face  to the citizens of the Bristol Bay region who petitioned to keep the region protected.The Pebble company sued the EPA in federal court claiming the agency colluded with environmental groups to block the mining project. The suit followed an EPA study that concluded the proposed large-scale mining posed a siginificant risk to the region s salmon and cause adverse effects to Alaskan Natives who based their culture around the salmon resources in the area. The EPA inspector general found no evidence that the EPA predetermined the outcome of the study in any way. Protecting Bristol Bay from the Pebble Mine has been a priority issue for the hook-and-bullet community for 10 years. This was a real test for President Trump, who said all the right things to sportsmen during the election,  said Scott Hed, the director of the Sportsman s Alliance for Alaska. This is a direct assault on our values. America s hunters and anglers are extremely disappointed but we will not let up in the fight to protect Bristol Bay.

This is more than just about Trump winning, it s about Trump doing the job the media should have been doing to expose Hillary Clinton as an accomplice to her perverted husband for decades Fresh from using the  R  word during a recent sit-down with Sean Hannity, Donald Trump on Monday released on Instagram a new campaign ad against Hillary Clinton featuring the voice of Bill Clinton s rape accuser, Juanita Broaddrick.

And the second time he tries to kiss me he starts biting my lip   He starts to, um, bite on my top lip and I tried to pull away from him. And then he forces me down on the bed. And I just was very frightened, and I tried to get away from him and I told him  No,  that I didn t want this to happen but he wouldn t listen to me.   It was a real panicky, panicky situation.

" Elizabeth Warren Calls Trump A ‘Two-Bit Dictator,’ Slams His RNC Speech","America got i s first true glimpse of a Trump presidency on the final night of the RNC. Instead of a speech focused on the economy and bringing back jobs to the United States, the charade delivered by the Republican presidential candidate was filled with hate and fear, resembling an almost Nixon-esque rhetoric not seen in almost fifty years.The nation needs to wake up. Luckily, we have Elizabeth Warren to help us do that.While appearing on CBS  Late Night with Stephen Colbert immediately following Trump s speech, Warren (who has been rumored as a potential VP choice for Hillary Clinton), slammed the Republican candidate for sounding like a  two-bit dictator  and chided him for his divisive rhetoric: What Donald Trump says is there s a problem out there and what you have to understand is that it s all about each other. What you need to be afraid of is every other American. I ve got to tell you, that speech tonight, he sounded like some two-bit dictator of some country that you couldn t find on a map. Through the applause and a hilarious  defense  of Trump from Colbert, Warren doubled down: He sounded like a dictator of a small country rather than a man who is running for the highest office of the strongest democracy on the face of the earth. That s what he sounded like. And just like that, Elizabeth Warren summed up exactly how we all feel. To put it plainly, as Warren did,  Donald Trump is a bad guy. Elizabeth Warren has been a special thorn in Donald Trump s side. No one, not the media or even Hillary Clinton, has gotten under Trump s skin more than she has. An attack dog in her own right, Warren has been absolutely spot on in her criticism of the potential fascist-in-chief: he s a thin skinned, dictating fraud.We learned earlier this week that Trump has no plan to actually take on the domestic or foreign roles needed to make a great president. That s what Mike Pence will be for.Hopefully Warren will reiterate her observations come the Democratic National Convention, where substance (not just venom) will be front and center for the whole country, and indeed the whole world, to see.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"July 22, 2016",2162
MUSLIM DEMOCRAT WOMAN Is Asked How She Feels About Trump’s Presidency: “If Arab countries can ban Muslim Brotherhood why can’t we?”,"Anila Ali was born in Karachi, Pakistan, and studied in London, where she became a volunteer in the All Pakistan Women s Association. In 1996, she came to California. She is an active member of the Council of Pakistan-American Affairs (COPAA), the author of  Mommy am I a ?  and a contributor to the largest Pakistani paper in the U.S., The Pakistan Link.Ali is the founder and board member of the American Muslim Women s Empowerment Council, which is the only Muslim women s organization that works on the ground with law enforcement and interfaith leaders to counter radicalization and build capacity in the Muslim community do they can be the first line of defense against radicalization.She graciously agreed to speak with Clarion Project Dialogue Coordinator Elliot Friedland about being a Muslim-American since the election. The views expressed herein are the author s own and do not necessarily reflect the view of Clarion Project. Ryan Mauro previously interviewed Anila Ali for Clarion Project.1. Clarion Project: Since Trump s election many Muslim groups are feeling scared that he will implement repressive policies targeted at the Muslim community. How do you feel about such fears?Anila Ali: There is a real fear in the community that a Trump presidency will mean restrictions on Muslims. There is talk of internment camps and it was in registry and that is generating a lot of misconceptions and fears. There is also a concern that Mosques and citizens will be monitored as well.Personally, I have faith in the constitution of the United States of America and I feel majority of America knows and understands that you cannot make generalized statements about all Muslims and paint all Muslims with the same brush stroke.But we have also realize that it is time that Muslims in America step up their game and get more involved in making sure that the neighbors understand who they are and that they are peace-loving patriotic Americans.For it is mostly the fear of the unknown that spreads misconceptions.2. Clarion: What should public figures be doing to calm inter-communal relations?Ali: Public figures, especially the ones in the majority party, have a responsibility to represent all Americans. Their words can help alleviate fears about Muslims and stop the Muslims from getting marginalized. Show of support unity with all unities that maybe feeling slightly marginalized, will help them from further isolation.The level of hateful rhetoric that I have heard in the past one month has been the worst since 911. It seems people have a newfound courage to tell  Muslims to leave the country,   pack up and leave the country  etc. Anti-Muslim sentiment is rampant and most people are not able to distinguish between a radical and a moderate.There is a general perception that all Muslims condone violence and that all Muslims want sharia law in America. There is also a very toxic perception that Muslims like myself who are any patriotic, modern and progressive are lying as mandated in the Quran to convert people, the concept being taqqiya. This notion must be dispelled because the majority of Muslims don t even know what this concept is. Muslims who have come from South Asia have no idea of this Arabic concept because it is part of the Wahhabi Salafist ideology and Muslims like me, majority coming from South Asia, have never even heard of it.These misconceptions in the mainstream community must be countered and dispelled.3. Clarion: What do you think the impact of designating the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization would be if it passed?Ali: If Arab countries can ban Muslim brotherhood why can t we? Any organization that has terrorist ties should be banned in the US. Any organization that condone the killing of an innocent, or promote so insights hatred for non-Muslims should be banned.4. Clarion: What organizations or activists would you recommend as standing up for the rights of the community and are unaffiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood or related organizations?Ali: Of course I would promote my own organization American Muslim women s empowerment Council, formed to counter extremism which gives women a voice, promotes the real Islam, gives women equality and completely condemns all shapes and forms of terrorism and hatred.Whoever wants to follow sharia law should migrate to a Muslim country like Saudi Arabia.For entire interview, go to the Clarion Project",politics,"Feb 13, 2017",4419

Sara snapped back,  Nobody was in the dark Jonathan! You wanna create this false narrative. If we want talk about ah contradicting statements and people that were maybe in the dark, how about the Democrats?  Let s read a few of them. You wanna talk about  em? Here s what Democrats said not that long ago about James Comey :Harry Reid said,  Comey should resign and be investigated by the Senate. Senator Chuck Schumer,  I don t have confidence in him anymore.  Senator Bernie Sanders said,  It would not be a bad thing for the American people if Comey resigned.  Nancy Pelosi said,  Comey was not in the right job.  Former DNC Chair, Debbie Wasserman Schultz said that she thought Comey was no longer able to serve in a neutral and credible way.  President Obama s advisor Valerie Jarrett reportedly urged him to fire Comey.  Just yesterday, Representative Maxine Waters said that,  Hillary Clinton would have fired Comey.  You wanna talk about people who are in the dark? The people that are in the dark today are the Democrats.Boom!Earlier today, we posted a video that President Trump posted to his Twitter page pointing out the absurd hypocrisy of the Democrats and their allies in the liberal media. This video pretty much sums up how hypocritical Democrats and their media arm really are when it comes to anything related to Trump.Watch:The Democrats should be ashamed.

 Bette Midler Weighs In On #CruzSexScandal And It Is Absolutely HILARIOUS (TWEET),"Bette Midler has made her distaste for the GOP s 2016 Clown Car perfectly clear, usually via her twitter account. On Monday morning, we woke up to the gross hashtag #CruzSexScandal trending on Twitter, and on Tuesday, the Divine Miss M made her thoughts on the matter perfectly clear in hilariously appropriate tweet. The tweet reads: I don t know if Ted Cruz really has 5 mistresses. If he does, let s hope they have better access to birth control than he would propose. Here is the tweet:I don t know if Ted Cruz really has 5 mistresses. If he does, let shope they have better access to birth control than he would propose.  Bette Midler (@BetteMidler) March 29, 2016Midler is right, of course. Now, to most of us, the idea that Ted Cruz could find five women who would voluntarily sleep with him is pretty gross, not to mention downright unbelievable. However, that s not the point here. Ted Cruz is no friend to women. He is completely against easy access to birth control, and he is adamantly pro-birth. We re talking about a guy who would make rape and incest victims give birth, no matter what, if he could. The idea that a man like that wants to be president of the United States in this day and age is downright scary. Cruz wants to get inside our bedrooms and uteri, but then again, that s the entire GOP s idea of so-called small government.Hopefully, if this is true, the women Cruz is stepping out on Heidi with think twice before they crawl into bed with him again.Featured image via Twitter",News,"March 29, 2016",1505
CHICAGO THUGS Watched 9 Yr Old Play On Swings Before Carrying Out His Brutal Murder In Retaliation Against Dad’s Gang,"UPDATE: No #BlackLivesMatter Protests PlannedChicago has no shortage of thugs. What they do have a shortage of is support from the #BlackLivesMatter terrorists and Obama Regime. You don t hear our Community Organizer In Chief running to a microphone every time a young black man or woman is murdered at the hands of another black man or woman. Sadly, it doesn t fit their narrative. This young boy s murder is far more tragic than the plight of the Muslim boy, with a history of discipline issues, who took a fake bomb to school in Texas on 9-11 and was rightly punished for his behavior by school officials. The phony outrage that Obama showed the world over this little fake  clock boy s  arrest should sicken every American. It is especially disturbing when one considers Obama s deafening silence over the horrific gang violence that plagues his hometown of Chicago. Where were the tweets of outrage from the White House over the loss of this beautiful young boy s life? Crickets On Friday, prosecutors laid out their case against a man accused of murdering 9-year-old Tyshawn Lee on Nov. 2Corey Morgan, 27, of suburban Lansing, was charged in the murder. Police have one other man in custody who has not yet been charged, and a third man, Kevin Edwards, is also wanted in the slaying.Prosecutors say Corey Morgan (left) and Kevin Edwards planned the heinous murder of 9-year-old Tyshawn Lee.Assistant State s Attorney George Canellis said Friday the shooting stemmed from an ongoing feud between Morgan s gang, the BBG (Bang Bang Gang)/Terror Dome faction of the Black P Stones and the Killaward faction of the Gangster Disciples.The feud came to a boil after an Oct. 13 shooting in which Morgan s brother, Tracey Morgan was killed and his mother was wounded. Morgan was so enraged he threatened to shoot  grandmas, mamas, kids and all  in retaliation, prosecutors said.Tyshawn was hit in his back, forearm and head, and part of his thumb was shot off as if he was raising his hand to block the shots, Canellis said. This murder was committed in a cold, calculated and premeditated manner,  Canellis said.Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy vowed to destroy the group responsible for the boy s brutal murder. They are going to be obliterated,  he said.  That gang just signed its death warrant. McCarthy did not detail each suspect s role in the shooting. We know that there were three individuals involved in this,  he said.Morgan s arrest comes nearly a month after Tyshawn s Nov. 2 shooting death.Police are hunting for Kevin Edwards, also suspected in the shooting.Court documents paint a disturbing picture of the planned attack, explaining that Morgan and his accomplices allegedly saw Tyshawn playing on the swings in a playlot with his basketball beside him. One of the suspects allegedly started dribbling Tyshawn s ball, ultimately luring him into the alley where police say he was  executed.

" Trump Put Himself In Deep Sh*t, Personally Drafted Statement Lying About Jr’s Russia Meeting","Donald Trump and all of the people around him have a serious problem with the truth. That problem is giving them serious legal problems that do not have to be when it comes to Special Counsel Robert Mueller s investigation into the Trump campaign s possible collusion with the Russians to try and fix the 2016 election.First, they said there were not meetings with Russians. Then, we find out that Donald Trump Jr., former Trump Campaign Manager Paul Manafort, and Trump s son-in-law Jared Kushner met with a shady Russian lawyer, along with other people tied to the Russian government. After that, Trump Jr. came out with a statement saying that they were talking about Russian adoptions and nothing else. Then, that statement fell apart when it turns out that they went into that meeting thinking they were going to get dirt on then-Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton from the Russian government. Now, it turns out that while the lawyers wanted to be truthful in Trump Jr. s statement, Donald Trump decided he wanted to lie for his son, and personally put together the statement.Trump s advisers are furious. One said, on condition of anonymity, to the Washington Post: This was . . . unnecessary. Now someone can claim he s the one who attempted to mislead. Somebody can argue the president is saying he doesn t want you to say the whole truth. The adviser then went on to suggest that Trump doesn t fully understand that he and his people are in serious legal trouble over the Russia investigation: He refuses to sit still. He doesn t think he s in any legal jeopardy, so he really views this as a political problem he is going to solve by himself. A lawyer who investigated President George W. Bush regarding the unmasking of CIA Agent Valerie Plame, Peter Zeidenberg, says of the bumbling attempt at a cover-up by Team Trump: The thing that really strikes me about this is the stupidity of involving the president. They are still treating this like a family-run business and they have a PR problem. . . . What they don t seem to understand is this is a criminal investigation involving all of them. Well, hopefully, they continue to screw up in their responses to this. There s definitely wrongdoing here. Perhaps Robert Mueller already has the smoking gun, and wants to make sure the case is airtight before they are all indicted and hauled off to jail where belong. In the meantime, the entire administration is dangerous and should be removed. Congress, do your jobs and throw ALL OF THESE people out of our White House.Featured image via John Moore/Getty Images ",News,"August 1, 2017",2572
 GOP Governor Calls Blacks “Colored People” (VIDEO),"Georgia s Republican governor Nathan Deal stirred up a hornet s nest of controversy when comments he made referring to black Americans as  colored people  surfaced on Wednesday night.Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal (R) went after opponents of an education ballot measure known as Amendment 1 in a speech last month, saying if they wanted to help  colored people,  this measure was a good place to start. The irony of some of the groups who are opposing doing something to help these minority children is beyond my logic. If you want to advance the state of colored people, start with their children,  Deal said in an Oct. 3 speech, Fox 5 in Atlanta reported Wednesday.Deal told a local news station that he meant to reference the NAACP, and didn t mean to say  colored people,  which is a dubious claim at best.The governor is a former member of congress who once wrote a formal letter to the Obama White House to formally raise questions about President Obama s place of birth as part of the birther conspiracy theory.Many have pointed out that the birther conspiracy is steeped in racist attitudes about the presidency and President Obama being the first black president, who was quickly challenged to present papers verifying his place of birth (it is Hawaii).Deal s comments come precisely when Republicans are still being forced to grapple with their presidential nominee Donald Trump s blatant embrace of racism. Trump s bigoted push has emboldened cells of white supremacists, who see their beliefs reflected in his words. That includes former Klansman David Duke, who is now a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate in Louisiana. And on the same night Deal s comments were publicized, Duke took part in a debate at a historically black university. Within the Republican Party, Duke has attracted a small following, but enough to qualify him for the debate stage.Featured image via screen capture",News,"November 3, 2016",1898
DANISH CITY OVERRUN WITH MUSLIM MIGRANTS Makes Pork Mandatory On All Municipal Menus,"Assimilate or go hungry  Human rights lawyers descend in 5 4 3 2 1 COPENHAGEN, Denmark   A Danish city has ordered pork to be mandatory on municipal menus, including for schools and daycare centers, with politicians insisting the move is necessary for preserving the country s food traditions and is not an attack on Muslims.Frank Noergaard, a member of the council in Randers that narrowly approved the decision earlier this week, says it was made to ensure that pork remains  a central part of Denmark s food culture. Denmark is a major pork producer and it is the most popular meat, but it is forbidden to Muslims and Jews. Most of the asylum-seekers who have arrived in the country in the past months are Muslim.Noergaard, a member of the anti-immigration, populist Danish People s Party that proposed the council motion, said Thursday that it wasn t meant as a  harassment of Muslims,  but added that he had received  several complaints about too many concessions  being made to Muslims in the small, predominantly Lutheran country. The signal we want to send here is that if you re a Muslim and you plan to come to Randers, don t expect you can impose eating habits on others. Pork here is on an equal footing with other food,  Noergaard told The Associated Press. He said that halal meat, vegetarian dishes and diets for diabetics would still be available.In 2013, then-Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt lashed out at some nurseries after they started serving halal-butchered meat instead of pork because Muslim children had refused to eat it.

DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ Accuses Obama’s DHS Director Jeh Johnson of Lying Under Oath [Video],"Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz dropped a big bomb during an interview on CNN today. She claimed that Jeh Johnson s  testimony about the DNC computer hack is  wrong in every respect  and  utterly misinformed.  Whoa! Who s telling the truth?Schultz told the CNN anchor  He s wrong in every respect. Let me be very clear. At no point during my tenure at the DNC was I contacted by the FBI, DHS, or any government agency, or alerted or made aware that they believed that the Russians, an enemy state, was intruding on our network. In case you missed it, former DHS Director Jeh Johnson testified to lawmakers this week that the DNC rejected his agency s offer to protect its network despite receiving warnings about a computer hack. Instead, the DNC chose an outside cyber security firm to help solve the computer hacks that led to WikiLeaks publishing thousands of its emails.CNN s Bolduan asked Schultz how both accounts could be true:  Secretary Johnson says DNC rebuffed the help offered. You are saying no one contacted you? Schultz replied with a shocking statement:  Secretary Johnson is utterly misinformed. That is simply not accurate. Schultz went further and blamed the FBI for not helping: They left the Russians on our network for more than for almost a year before we discovered that they were there.

 McCain CALLS OUT Trump: Show Us The Evidence!,"Donald Trump screwed himself over by letting his tiny little hands go Twitter-happy over the weekend. Just because he was pissed off over Jeff Sessions  recusal, Trump failed to manage his emotions like an adult and couldn t keep his temper tantrum in check. America watched on, horrified, as the current POTUS accused former President Barack Obama of wiretapping his phones in the Trump Tower on Saturday morning. And now, he s facing severe consequences as people want answers.It is already highly probably that Trump has zero evidence to back up his accusation of Obama, mostly because he frequently lies and spreads false information based on his emotional state. Trump has also repeatedly been asked to provide concrete proof that Obama tapped his phones, and hasn t been able to show anything that would make his inappropriate accusations believable. Even Trump s fellow Republicans are demanding answers to such a ridiculous attack, one of them being Sen. John McCain, who has been a critical conservative voice against Trump since his presidential campaign.On Monday, McCain demanded that Trump release evidence to support his allegations, and also trashed the White House for not being able to provide more information about Trump s claims. McCain argued that Americans have a right to know on what basis the president of the United States said that his predecessor had broken the law by wiretapping Trump Tower. Clearly shocked by the whole matter, McCain admitted to reporters,  I haven t seen anything like this.  Noting that the Trump administration  should answer questions,  McCain said: The American people should demand it. The dimensions of this are huge. McCain went on to say just how shocking Trump s weekend tweets had been. McCain admitted that when he saw Trump s first tweet against Obama on Saturday morning, his first reaction was  intense curiosity. This is unprecedented. I have never heard of a president of the United States accusing his predecessor or any other president of the United States of violating the law. Trump had given America many firsts over the past year or so, and none of them were good. That is something we all can agree on, regardless of party affiliation. McCain s comments prove that even the GOP is regretful and fed up of Trump s behavior.Featured image via Alex Wong / Getty Images",News,"March 7, 2017",2338
"OBAMA AGREES WITH MUSLIM NEWS Network Whose Facebook Page Celebrates Jihad Against Gays In Orlando…GUNS To Blame For Terror Act, NOT Hate-Filled, Intolerant Democrat Muslim","Liberals like to use the term  right wing extremists . They like to blame the Christian faith every time a Planned Parenthood abortion mill is shot up or an abortion  doctor  is killed. But the minute a Muslim terrorists kills or harms another human being, religion somehow, has nothing to do with it. America woke up to the horrible news of an unimaginable mass murder against over 100 innocent people in Orlando yesterday, at the hands of a Muslim man, who openly pledged his allegiance to ISIS. Instead of addressing America with a call to vigilance against Muslim radicals, Obama predictably called for gun control. Not that it comes as a surprise, but his friends over at the radical Al Jazeera news agree.Omar Mateen called the cops to pledge his fealty to ISIS as he was carrying out his mass murder in Orlando early Sunday. Twelve hours later, the president of the United States declared that  we have no definitive assessment on the motivation  of Omar Mateen but that  we know he was a person filled with hate. So I guess the president thinks Mateen didn t mean it?Here again, and horribly, we have an unmistakable indication that Obama finds it astonishingly easy to divorce himself from a reality he doesn t like   the reality of the Islamist terror war against the United States and how it is moving to our shores in the form of lone-wolf attacks.He called it  terror,  which it is. But using the word  terror  without a limiting and defining adjective is like a doctor calling a disease  cancer  without making note of the affected area of the body   because if he doesn t know where the cancer is and what form it takes, he cannot attack it effectively and seek to extirpate it.So determined is the president to avoid the subject of Islamist, ISIS-inspired or ISIS-directed terrorism that he concluded his remarks with an astonishing insistence that  we need the strength and courage to change  our attitudes toward the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community.That s just disgusting. There s no other word for it. Via: NYPWe re seeing the demonization of the AR-!5 all over liberal media in the wake of the Orlando terrorist attack. As usual they seek to deflect from the real problem, the Islamic terrorism, and try to shift blame to gun. It s perhaps particularly galling given that their readership is cheering the attack.So some facts for Al Jazeera and other fact-challenged liberal media.AR-15 is not an assault rifle and is not an automatic rifle. Fully automatic rifles have been severely restricted from civilian ownership since 1934. AR-15 is semi-automatic like most guns and is no more powerful than any other common rifle. It fires only one round with each pull of the trigger.The AR in  AR-15  rifle stands for ArmaLite rifle, after the company that developed it in the 1950s.  AR  does NOT stand for  assault rifle  or  automatic rifle. The AR-15 is one of the most common rifles in the country, popular for hunting, sport or self-defense.Al Jazeera is even incorrect in referring in the graphic to a magazine as a  clip .

HOUSE OF LIES: Pedophilia Allegations Levied Against Anti-Trump Actor Kevin Spacey Who Has Secret History With Bill Clinton,"How should the gay community feel about the Trump-hating actor, and Bill Clinton pal, Kevin Spacey, coming out as a  gay  man, as an excuse or distraction for attempting to molest a 14-year-old boy when he was 26-years -old? Star Trek: Discovery  actor Anthony Rapp claims Kevin Spacey got sexually aggressive toward him when he was only 14 years old, and Spacey has responded by apologizing and coming out as gay.Rapp told BuzzFeed News the incident occurred in 1986   the 2 were both on Broadway at the time. Rapp says Spacey told him he was having a party and invited him.Rapp says he got bored and retreated to the bedroom to watch TV. He said Spacey came in the room and appeared drunk, then  picked me up like a groom picks up the bride over the threshold. But I don t, like, squirm away initially, because I m like,  What s going on?  And then he lays down on top of me. Rapp says Spacey was holding him down as he struggled to get away, adding,  He was trying to seduce me.  He eventually got away and left.Spacey, now 58, responded on social media, saying,  I have a lot of respect and admiration for Anthony Rapp as an actor. I am beyond horrified to hear his story. I honestly do not remember the encounter, it would have been over 30 years ago. But if I did behave as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior  In response to the allegations, Spacey tweeted that he was  beyond horrified to hear [Rapp s] story.   TMZ I honestly do not remember the encounter, it would have been over 30 years ago. But if I did behave then as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior, and I am sorry for the feelings he describes having carried with him all these years. Here is Kevin Spacey s  Sorry, but I was drunk and I don t remember, but am truly sorry if I acted as a child predator and oh, by the way, I m gay, so can we just make that the news story?

CEO of Allied Artists excusing sexual assault of a minor  Lydia Snider (@LydiaSnider) October 30, 2017 In 2008, financier Jeffrey Epstein, whose friends included some of the most powerful people on the planet, was convicted of soliciting an under-age girl for prostitution.Spacey was on board Epstein s private jet with Bill Clinton when it flew from JFK Airport into the Azores before the former President and the actor enjoyed a tour of Africa.According to Fox News, Epstein,  Allegedly had a team of traffickers who procured girls as young as 12 to service his friends on  Orgy Island,  an estate on Epstein s 72-acre island, called Little St. James, in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Bill Clinton took at least 26 trips on the Lolita Express, a luxury jet fitted out with beds where prominent elitists allegedly had sex with young girls, ditching his Secret Service detail for 5 of those trips.Clinton chose to continue his association with Epstein even after, according to the Alliance to Rescue Victims of Trafficking,  everyone within his inner circles knew was a pedophile. Epstein also reportedly had 21 different phone numbers for Bill Clinton.While there is no evidence to suggest Spacey engaged in criminal activity while on board Epstein s jet, his admission that he sexually assaulted a 14-year-old boy is sure to provoke further questions.ABC Action News   Spacey, who has been famously private about his personal life, said that he now lives as a gay man   which marked the first time the actor has made a public statement about his sexual orientation. This story has encouraged me to address other things about my life,  Spacey said in his tweet. He continued that he has had  relationships with both men and women,  and added,  I have loved and had romantic encounters with men throughout my life, and I choose now to live as a gay man. Is Spacey suggesting that s it s  normal  behavior for all gay men to molest young boys?  Or is the Trump-hating actor attempting to convince people that it s okay for a 26-year-old man to molest a 14-year-old boy if he was drunk, or that if he  already forgotten about it, we should too?So many questions remain, like for instance, will Prince Charles  Un-Knight  the alleged pedophile actor?https://twitter.com/KevinSpacey/status/743590498456088576Spacey took the opportunity to bash Trump while in France at an awards ceremony: Watch Spacey and unhinged Late Show s  Stephen Colbert, who been allowing Donald Trump to live rent-free in his head for well over a year, bash Donald Trump: ",left-news,"Oct 30, 2017",5118
 Republican Insiders Predict The Party Will Implode At GOP Convention,"A caucus formed by Politico consisting of operatives and strategists in ten battleground states around the country responded overwhelmingly they predict neither Donald Trump nor Ted Cruz will win the Republican Presidential nomination on the first ballot of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this summer. Nearly 90 percent of the insiders in the Republican Party made this prediction, which is the hope and aspiration of many Republicans who are embarrassed both Ted Cruz and Donald Trump have garnered so much support from Republican voters.Cruz and Trump s insane rhetoric and policy proposals almost make Ohio Governor John Kasich look like a Democrat in comparison. As Republicans cannot come to a consensus over a presidential nominee, the Republican Party will likely fall apart at the convention. If Donald Trump doesn t win the nomination after winning the most pledged delegates, he would likely make a third party run as his ego will not accept losing as an option. His supporters will likely engage in violent protesting as the patients take over the insane asylum. Trump supporters have treated anyone who dares defy the Donald at rallies with violence, there is no telling what they will do if the Republican Party doesn t hand over the keys to the presidential nomination. Donald Trump has one chance to win the nomination, and that is on the first ballot. Right now, I put his chances at about 40 percent, and that will require him to get some number of delegates from the unpledged delegates in states like North Dakota, Colorado, Pennsylvania, and a few territories,  an Iowa Republican said in his response to the Politico survey, which was conducted anonymously. Even if Donald Trump does win the Republican nomination at the convention, so many Republicans despise him and his rise in the party, they would rather have a Democrat in the White House than listen to Donald Trump steer the direction of the GOP, which right now is going full speed off a cliff.Featured image courtesy of Flickr",News,"April 9, 2016",2024
"SWEDEN LOSES 14,000 Refugees Slated For Deportation: “We simply do not know where they are”","It s time for Sweden to take off the blindfolds and stop pretending their progressive policies are somehow benefiting their citizens. How does a country lose 14,000 foreign invaders anyway? And where did those 14,000 refugees go?As part of the just concluded  cash for refugees  deal between the EU Turkey, the FT adds that not only will migrants whose asylum applications are rejected be sent back to Turkey but that this  crackdown on irregular migration would be complemented by a parallel programme offering a legal route to Europe, resettling up to 500,000 Syrian refugees directly from Turkey, Lebanon or Jordan. The FT adds that, as expected,  if such an EU-wide scheme were made mandatory it would be flatly opposed by many eastern European countries. To avoid the proposals being blocked, Brussels and Berlin are exploring a  voluntary  scheme with 10 countries willing to take refugees. It is unclear whether other Schengen members would be asked to contribute to the costs of resettlement. But before crossing that particular bridge, which will sow even further anger, mistrust and antagonism spread among the member countries of the European  Union , a bigger question is just how will Europe track down and sequester those refugees that pose the biggest threat in the eyes of authorities, those who are already slated for deportation.As the following case study from Sweden proves, having once entered Europe, Europe may have problems trying to track down the hundreds of thousands of refugees having already found their way to the continent.As Sweden s Afton Bladet reports, over half of all the illegal migrants slated for deportation in Sweden have mysteriously disappeared.The National Border Police Section reports that of the 21,748 individuals due to be sent home after their asylum applications were turned down, a whopping 14,140 have simply vanished off the police radar. Around a third, or the remaining 7,608, still live and are accounted for in the Swedish Migration Board s premises or have indicated an address for their own homes. It is not clear if anyone has actually tried following up on said home address to see how many have simply made one up.Based on a translation of the Swedish report by Breitbart, some are expected to have left the country secretly,  but the majority are thought to still be in Sweden, having fallen through the cracks of the comprehensive welfare state. The local cops is brutally honest:  We simply do not know where they are , said Patrik Engstrom, a spokesman for the local police.This is not the first time refugees have vanished from official supervision: one month ago we reported that roughly 4,000 asylum-seekers who had initially been accomodated by the German state of Lower Saxony had  mysteriously disappeared.  To our knowledge they have still not been found. Via: Zero Hedge",left-news,"Nov 29, 2015",2847
HILLARY’S TOP AIDE Is About To See Her Husband’s Scandalous Life Played Out On Big Screen: “WEINER” Debuts In May [WATCH TRAILER],"Dinesh D Souza s  Hillary s America  will debut in theaters in July.  Clinton Cash  is a documentary that investigates donations made to the Clinton Foundation by foreign entities, paid speeches made by Bill and Hillary Clinton, and the Clintons  personal enrichment since leaving the White House in 2001. It also debuts this summer. And now,  Weiner  exploring the life of a world class narcissist who just happens to be married to Hillary s top aide and special friend who is also tied to Hillary s email scandal investigation, Huma Abedin. With so many scandalous movies surrounding the life of Corrupt Hillary debuting this spring and summer, it s hard to know what to see first. We only have one question. Did filmmaker, Mr. Kriegman credit Andrew Breitbart for  exposing  (pun intended) the truth about Anthony Weiner?Mr. Kriegman s careful chronicling of Mr. Weiner s campaign is poised to prompt a much broader reassessment of a tabloid-tarred politician.  Weiner,  a feature-length documentary by Mr. Kriegman and Elyse Steinberg, will be released on May 20, amid one of the most contentious presidential elections in memory, and it may be the most intimate and provocative portrait of a political race since  The War Room. Mr. Weiner   whose moth-to-the-flame instinct toward exposure led in part to his resignation from Congress in 2011 after admitting he had lied about online liaisons with women   granted extraordinary access to Mr. Kriegman, in exchange for the occasional use of his footage during the campaign. The filmmaker agreed to step out of the room whenever Mr. Weiner asked.And yet there is Mr. Kriegman in the back of a sport utility vehicle, filming as Mr. Weiner tries to persuade his wife, Huma Abedin, to appear at a primary-night party where Sydney Leathers, Mr. Weiner s erstwhile sexting partner, is lurking outside. Mr. Kriegman is inside the couple s apartment at breakfast time as Ms. Abedin, a frozen smile on her face, confides to the camera that she is  living a nightmare. There are startling moments of Mr. Weiner analyzing his own transgressions (he calls them  the things ) and facing teary-eyed staff members. Hours after Mr. Weiner s campaign is stricken by revelations of new online infidelities, the film finds husband and wife alone in a conference room, staring at each other for what may be the longest and most painful onscreen marital silence this side of an Ingmar Bergman film. The door closes, and I m filming, and I m riveted by what s happening,  Mr. Kriegman recalled in an interview last month.  But I m definitely thinking to myself:  I can t believe I m standing here right now. He almost never got the chance. Mr. Kriegman had known Mr. Weiner for years, serving as chief of staff in his district office. After a decade in politics, he began pursuing a film career, earning credits on MTV and PBS. He and Ms. Steinberg, who are both 36, and previously collaborated on a documentary about prison reform, came to view Mr. Weiner as an ideal subject.Via: NYT s ",politics,"May 12, 2016",3020
DEMOCRATS ARE AFRAID That Trump Will Beat Hillary…And Here’s The Proof [VIDEO],"Don t let Hillary s cheerleaders in the mainstream media convince you that she can beat Trump. Trump has proven himself to be a formidable opponent and don t forget that Hillary was beaten by an amateur Jr. Senator in 2008. I ve consistently said throughout the analysis of this race that I would not want to run against Donald Trump because I think he s the most dangerous candidate. Give me Ted Cruz, give me John Kasich, give me any of the vanquished they re traditional politicians, easy to beat. And, Ted Cruz, in particular, way outside the mainstream,  she said. Donald Trump, when you look from what he said the other day about the gender bill and using the bathrooms, it proves that point because he knows how to appeal to not only Libertarians but to Independents who support that, too.   So he will be a very, very tough candidate to face in a general election. I think it will be one of the closest elections we see since 2000. https://youtu.be/ZqtKc1aPiA4",politics,"Apr 25, 2016",968

 Louisiana Governor Blasts Trump Over His Photo-Op Exploitation,"While Republicans try to make Louisiana s deadly floods  Obama s Katrina,  there is only one person getting flack for being a raging opportunist   you guessed it   Donald Trump.Louisiana s Democratic governor, John Bel Edwards, blasted the Republican nominee for president after he showed up to Louisiana for a photo opportunity. While citizens are dying and being displaced by the thousands, Trump has decided he would exploit the carnage in an attempt to undermine President Obama.Remember when President Obama was chided by the GOP for not calling Gov. Rick Scott for two days after the Orlando massacre? Well, flooding has been going on in Louisiana for a week and still, Donald Trump has not reached out to the governor or any state leader tasked with handling the crisis. A spokesman for the governor pointed out:Donald Trump hasn t called the governor to inform him of his visit. We welcome him to LA but not for a photo-op. Instead we hope he ll consider volunteering or making a sizable donation to the LA Flood Relief Fund to help the victims of the storm.Trump, the self described billionaire and charitable man, should donate.While Republicans continue to bash President Obama, Edwards has gone on the record asking that President Obama not travel to Louisiana for at least a week until the state is more secure   out of respect and timeliness of those working to aid the state.Trump s newest campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said the trip is  a decidedly nonpolitical event, no press allowed, going to help people on the ground who are in need. And what did Trump do as soon as she said that? He took questions from the press and said President Obama would rather play golf than help those affected in Louisiana. Even though President Obama has secured the relief funds for the state and has expressed his support and thoughts for those affected, the Trump train has decided to use the opportunity to smear him and once again make Trump look like the unsung hero of the day.So much for no media and not being political.Once again, Trump is exploiting and using people s pain for personal gain. He s done that his entire life, so why stop now.Featured image via Joshua Lott/Getty Images",News,"August 19, 2016",2199
 Trump Is HOPING People Won’t See This Video That PROVES He’s Lying About Voter Fraud,"CNN talked to the man who conducted the study Donald Trump cited as  proof  that 3 million people voted illegally in the 2016 Election and Trump will not like what he said.During an interview with Wolf Blitzer, political science professor Brian Schaffner absolutely shattered Trump s claim that he only lost the popular vote because over 3 million people voted illegally.Trump s claim has been debunked multiple times and even many Republicans are embarrassed by it enough that they are begging him to stop repeating such a blatant lie.Blitzer asked Schaffner about the data his team collected in a 2014 study which found that  14 percent of non-citizens said they were eligible to vote. Schaffner has since called the study unreliable because his team went back to talk to the participants and found that none of them actually voted. As it turns out, they merely clicked the wrong button when answering the question.SCHAFFNER: Well, what the authors did was essentially use a question on our survey that asked people whether or not they were a citizen. What we did was actually go back and ask those people again whether or not they were a citizen, and a lot of people had just basically erroneously clicked on the wrong button, and the people who we could actually confirm were actually noncitizens, they were basically no voters among that group.BLITZER: Either   so, what you re saying, that no non-citizens voted as far as your study, your data was concerned, in those elections?SCHAFFNER: That s right. We could find   of the people who we were sure were noncitizens, we could not find any who had actually cast a vote.So Trump is literally citing an unreliable study as evidence of his claims, something that Schaffner finds absolutely  frustrating. It s very frustrating,  Schaffner said. The data certainly do not show that. We published a study basically showing that the study that the data   that uses our data to say that, is wrong. That study has been widely cited by news outlets to basically say what the administration is saying is false.And the notion that millions of people could vote illegally and no one would have any data to be able to show this is the case is just absurd. It s absurd that millions of people, millions of noncitizens, would have voted in 2016. It s just   it s just not even plausible. Schaffner went on to concede that a handful of non-citizens may have voted in the election, but the scale of voter fraud Donald Trump is talking about is impossible.Here s the video via Media Matters.Indeed, Trump claimed that massive voter fraud was being committed during the campaign, only to be refuted by Ohio s Republican Secretary of State Jon Husted. Our institutions, like our election system, is one of the bedrocks of American democracy,  Husted said in October.  We should not question it or the legitimacy of it. It works very well. The idea of widespread voter fraud would require some systemic problem in our system, and so if there s a systemic problem, please identify it. Don t just make an allegation on Twitter. Tell me, tell the secretaries of state around the country what the problem is so that we can fix it. But right now we re not aware of any systemic problems in our voting system. Are there cases of voter fraud? Absolutely, there are cases of voter fraud. But it s rare, and we catch these people. Most times we catch them before their vote is even counted. And that goes for every state across the nation. Trump should be embarrassed and ashamed. And if he really thinks our election was rigged then we should hold a brand new election immediately and give him something to really cry about when the American people reject him.Featured Image: Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"January 25, 2017",3727

 Obama Just Completely F*cked Over Trump’s ‘Muslim Registry’ Plan,"Donald Trump was really looking forward to using a dormant regulation as the basis for his Muslim registry. While The Donald planned to resurrect the Bush-era National Entry-Exit Registration System (NSEERS)   a program that was condemned heavily for targeting Muslims   Obama decided that he might as well just eliminate it before Trump can make good on his promise to bring it back.On Thursday, the Department of Homeland Security published a new regulation that completely eliminates NSEERS, which has lain dormant since President Obama suspended the program in 2011:The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is removing outdated regulations relating to an obsolete special registration program for certain nonimmigrants. DHS ceased use of the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System (NSEERS) program in 2011 after finding that the program was redundant, captured data manually that was already captured through automated systems, and no longer provided an increase in security in light of DHS s evolving assessment of the threat posed to the United States by international terrorism. The regulatory structure pertaining to NSEERS no longer provides a discernable public benefit as the program has been rendered obsolete.Accordingly, DHS is removing the special registration program regulations.The best part? This new rule takes effect almost immediately, so there is nothing at all Trump can do to stop Obama from scuttling his hopes of using NSEERS to create his Nazi-esque program.This seems to be a response to a plea from New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman to President Obama. In a letter addressed to the President, Schneiderman pointed out (very correctly): We can t risk giving President-elect Trump the tools to create an unconstitutional religious registry. Schneiderman praised the President s decision Thursday: This is a win for civil rights and for smart, effective law enforcement, as well as for the strong coalition of advocacy organizations and others who fought to dismantle this discriminatory tool,  he said.  My office will continue do everything it can to protect the rights of all New Yorkers, and ensure equal justice under the law for all, regardless of religion or national origin. If Trump wants to create a Muslim registry   and he really, really does  he s going to need to find another way to do it.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"December 22, 2016",2401
 Major Study Finds Marijuana Perfectly Safe For Teens,"We ve come a long way from the days of rampant stupidity concerning marijuana use. We used to believe in  reefer madness,  the laughable idea that smoking pot would drive you innnnsaaaannnnne! Then there was the idiotic idea that marijuana was a  gateway drug  that would inevitably lead potheads to become heroin addicts. Then, more recently, there was the belief that getting high would make teens less intelligent. But, like most propaganda, the myth of the pot-addled teen ahem went up in smoke when science got involved:The study, published online January 6 in the Journal of Psychopharmacology, found a statistical association between cannabis use and decreased intellectual performance. However, this association vanished when the researchers took other variables into account.  The notion that cannabis use itself is causally related to lower IQ and poorer educational performance was not supported in this large teenage sample,  wrote Claire Mokrysz of the University College London and her colleagues.A quick disclaimer here: I don t smoke marijuana. I have never smoked marijuana. I will never smoke marijuana (even if I didn t have asthma). Not interested, don t care. However, I grew up around a lot of people that smoked pot so I find the hysteria over it to be ridiculous. I find the idea of putting people in jail for smoking it offensive in the extreme. Cigarettes and beer are far more harmful but marijuana is dangerous? Spare me from your ignorance. Smoke m if you got em.That s not to say that the low I.Q. story appeared in a vacuum. A study released in 2012 clearly pointed to the possibility that marijuana use over a long period of time could lower your intelligence. People familiar with the drug were, needless to say, skeptical but the anti-pot crusaders latched onto this for dear life. After all, all of their other talking points (addictive, lethal, causes violence, etc.) have come up short. But now that the original research has been duplicated and expanded on, we know that the original study was flawed. That, of course, is the beauty of science, it self-corrects: People often believe that using cannabis can be very damaging to intellectual ability in the long-term, but it is extremely difficult to separate the direct effects of cannabis from other potential explanations,  Mokrysz added.  Adolescent cannabis use often goes hand in hand with other drug use, such as alcohol and cigarette smoking, as well as other risky lifestyle choices. It s hard to know what causes what- do kids do badly at school because they are smoking weed, or do they smoke weed because they re doing badly? This study suggests it is not as simple as saying cannabis is the problem. Will the anti-marijuana crusaders amend their narrative or will they continue to insist that smoking pot makes you dumb? Considering their fear of cannabis is irrational to begin with, it s unlikely they ll let go of such a useful fiction.Featured image via twitter ",News,"January 14, 2016",2966
 Video Of Man Casually Doing Interview After Just Being Shot Goes Viral (VIDEO),"A Quincy, Il, man was shot in the hourly hours of Thursday morning and then right after, did an interview while smoking a cigarette, in what appears to be one of the most interesting interviews of the year.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_wMhAFL188]The Quincy man, Devon, was  in the room, kicking like I usually do, drinking,  when someone fired bullets through his apartment, striking him in the chest.Despite the danger, Devon said that he  wasn t trippin, it was a petty wound and sh*t.  The first thing he thought about wasn t his wound though. His main concern was to get his son out of the way. Luckily, his son wasn t hurt.During the interview, Devon lifted his shirt to show his bandages from the wound, casually shrugging off the event, saying some people  probably want [him] dead  and are  on some other stuff. One can t help but notice how unaffected, calm, and desensitized Devon seems to be, at least while conducting the interview. Even the journalist, Reyna Harvey, who was interviewing him is calm, which lead Chad Douglas a broadcaster at the studio to lament that the entire event was  incredible. While the event is indeed incredible, there seems to be something quite eerie about the desensitization of all involved in this almost tragic event.

 Racist Moron Gets Fired For This 20 Second Video Of Him Shouting ‘Wetback’… At An Arabic Person (VIDEO),"It s not often that the stupidity of a racist has layers. Typically a slur is aimed at a minority that is easily recognizable, disgusting and crass followed by a video being released and the internet calling the bigot in question out for it.

During his hand-clapping chorus of  Beaner! Beaner! Wetback! Wetback!  the poster child for more education funding ignores one fun fact: The woman he is shouting at for being Latino tells him repeatedly that she is, in fact, of Arabic descent.That in and of itself shows just what a doofus the a-hole is. In the obvious circles he has to run in, being Arabic is far worse than being Hispanic. Hispanics are just drug dealers and rapists while Arabic people are all packing suicide vests.

 Billionaire Mogul Steve Cohen Pledges Nearly $300 Million To Give Veterans Free Healthcare,"In an age where billionaires are buying elections, tearing down the environment in pursuit of oil and gas, evading their taxes and just screwing over humanity in general, some are doing genuine good.Take billionaire hedge fund manager Steve Cohen, for instance. Cohen, founder and CEO of Point72 Asset Management and S.A.C. Capital Advisors, has pledged through his newest endeavor The Cohen Veteran s Network a whopping $275 million for our veterans. His goal? To provide them with free mental healthcare by picking up the cost. An additional $30 million will be used for research programs through Cohen Veteran Bioscience.In a statement, Cohen, who is worth over $11 billion, and his network partner Dr. Anthony Hassan, praised United States  veterans and called on America to  pay the debt  of gratitude:The wounds of war are serious. It is not easy to serve your country in combat overseas and then come back into society seamlessly, especially if you are suffering. These men and women have paid an incredible price and it s important that this country pays back that debt. We will treat anyone who served in the U.S. Armed Forces during the war on terror. If you wore the uniform, and you need help, you are welcome at Cohen Veterans Network period. The $275 million will be spent over the next five years to open 25 clinics all across the country, collectively named the Steven A. Cohen Military Family Clinics. So far, four are scheduled to open in July in southwestern cities including Dallas, Los Angeles and San Antonio. One will open in New York, and by the spring of next year, one will be opened in Philadelphia.According to the CVN website, goals of the network are:Cohen, a Republican, recently made a hefty donation of $2 million to now failed presidential candidate Chris Christie, and currently has a son, Robert, who served in the United States military.Some billionaires are bad.

BREAKING NEWS: OBAMA’S AG Loretta Lynch Ordered Manafort’s Phone Tapped During Meeting With Russian Lawyer,"Is anyone really shocked that another fake  Trump-Russian collusion  story points to Obama and his crooked administration?Today, Fusion GPS employee Rinat Akhmetshin today confirmed his attendance at a meeting with Donald Trump Jr, Paul Manafort, and Jared Kushner along with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.Accusations have arisen that the meeting was part of a wider setup to achieve a FISA warrant to wiretap phones of the Trump campaign during 2016. President Trump himself has accused the FBI under Loretta Lynch of wiretapping his campaign. Now, a former Trump campaign official reports that Paul Manafort s phone was subject to FISA wiretap during the infamous meeting.If true, this FISA warrant would have been carried out under Loretta Lynch, Attorney General to Barack Obama. Former FBI Director James Comey has testified under oath to instances of collusion between AG Lynch and the Clinton campaign during 2016, as well as obstruction of justice in the Clinton investigation. Yesterday, multiple news agencies and President Trump all stated that Veselnitskaya was granted special permission to enter the US by Attorney General Lynch after her visa had been initially blocked.FISA transcripts of the meeting in June 2016 may have also served the basis of the FBI s investigation into the Trump campaign s ties to Russia, now headed by Bob Mueller.Other senior members of the Trump campaign may have participated in the meeting via conference call. Update: This would have been illegal, as FISA court denied Obama s June 2016 request.For entire story: Jack Posobiac, The Medium",left-news,"Jul 14, 2017",1592

 Donald Trump Is Time’s Person Of The Year — So Was Hitler… And Stalin… And Putin,"Donald Trump has been crowned 2016 Person of the Year by Time Magazine. He is no doubt over the moon with all of his  winning.  The rest of us were left looking at his orange face staring back from the cover and wondering WTF? However, when you look at past recipients of this award you begin to see that maybe this designation is fitting after all.Adolf Hitler started WWII and inflicted human suffering on an unprecedented level. He was responsible for the  death of tens of millions of people, including more than 20 million in the Soviet Union.  Hitler was the man behind concentration camps and gas chambers. And he was named Man of the Year by Time in 1938.Image via TimeJoseph Stalin  was the dictator of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) from 1929 to 1953. Under Stalin, the Soviet Union was transformed from a peasant society into an industrial and military superpower. However, he ruled by terror, and millions of his own citizens died during his brutal reign.  He was named Time s Man of the Year twice, receiving the title in both 1939 and 1942.Image via TimeMore recently, in 2007, Vladimir Putin was Time s Person of the Year. This guy requires no history lesson. He is the president of Russia and was so anxious for Trump to win the presidency that he interfered in the U.S. election to ensure Hillary Clinton was defeated.Image via TimeWhen you look at it in that context, Trump being named this year s Person of the Year isn t so out of place. Indeed, Time has bestowed this award upon some of the most brutal dictators in recent history. With this understanding, Trump s face on the cover is all the more terrifying.

 Fox News Will NEVER Be Able To Say ‘Fair And Balanced’ Again After What Hannity Just Did (AUDIO),"There is a saying    In Politics, a gaffe is when you accidentally tell the truth.  With that in mind, Sean Hannity just committed the most epic of gaffes during his own radio show when he forgot everything and admitted the truth about not only himself but Fox News as well.The issue being discussed was Hannity s softball interviews with Donald Trump. While most of the Republican establishment are doing everything they can to stop Trump, Hannity has been practically turning over his own show to Trump for his propaganda purposes in every interview he conducts with him.Hannity has gotten some recent blowback on this behavior and took it VERY personally. It got him so worked up and upset, that in a moment of anger-fueled honesty he blurted out,  I m not a journalist!  Well, look who hit the final stage of grief   acceptance.Sean finally admitted the thing he s been denying for years; the fact that he s nothing but a screaming loser who has as much journalistic ability as a rotten egg. I ll be honest, if I m interviewing Hillary Clinton, it s going to be 100 times harder than any Republican, because I believe the Republicans have a far better vision, one that I agree with. I just have less disagreement with them. I m not a journalist, I m a talk show host. Fair and Balanced?   The hell you say!It surely has to be uncomfortable for the Fox News executives in charge of Hannity to be put into this pickle. He s a huge cash cow for them, yet now he s admitting that not only himself   but Fox News by extension in their employment of him   are nothing but hacks stirring a huge stinking pot of propaganda stew that they force feed gullible Americans every night.Listen to Hannity destroy that final scrap of his credibility below:Featured image via youtube screen capture",News,"April 14, 2016",1785
 Man Gets 25-50 Years In Prison After Son Is Fatally Shot By Sister With His Unsecured Gun,"A Detroit man has been sentenced to 25-50 years in prison after his 9-year-old son was killed in an accidental shooting when his older sister found their father s unsecured gun.On Monday, the 45-year-old man was convicted of involuntary manslaughter, child abuse and several weapons charges. This responsible gun owner  was negligent, and that negligence not only took the life of his child, but has also now put him behind bars for at least a quarter of a century. He apologized in court and said that he loves his children dearly.The boy and his 11-year-old sister were visiting their father at his home on Nov. 9. The father s loaded gun was reportedly hidden in his bedroom closet, but due to the curious nature of young children, the deadly weapon didn t stay hidden for very long.The young girl testified in court that she and her brother were playing an imaginary game and they were acting out a video game when the tragedy occurred. She had been holding the shotgun when suddenly, it accidentally fired, killing her younger brother. She was given immunity for her testimony.The names of the father, sister, and other family members are being withheld so as not to identify the victim in this tragic case.Accidental shootings of young children are the most heartbreaking victims of gun violence. According to The Gun Violence Archive, 350 children under the age of 12 have been killed or injured by guns so far this year. The number of older children that have been victims of gun violence in 2016 is even higher, with 1,699 teens age 12-17 being shot. And we are only in July.Meanwhile, the NRA and gun-loving right-wingers refuse to admit that America has a problem with guns.

HERE YOU GO! TRUMP CONDEMNS DAVID DUKE…Calls Him A “Bigot” and A “Racist” [Video],"Following the situation in Charlottesville, Trump was one of the very few people to call out all sides for displays of violence and bigotry: white supremacists, black supremacists, Communists, and Antifa. In short, this flurry of frustration was far from one-sided.Amidst all of the chaos, David Duke tried to link Trump to the bigotry and violence that was present in Charlottesville. This is certainly interesting considering the fact that Trump called Duke out on his own bigotry nearly seventeen years ago. In an interview with Matt Lauer in 2000, Trump condemned Duke while being questioned about his reasons for dropping out of the Reform Party primary.Trump attributed the party s  self-destructing  nature to the people involved with it, specifically Duke. When pressed on this matter by Lauer, Trump responded,  Well, you ve got David Duke just joined, a bigot, a racist, a problem, I mean, this is not exactly the people you want in your party.

HACKED EMAILS Reveal Clinton Foundation CEO Was A Mole…Where Is He Now?,"WHY WAS BRAVERMAN ON TRANSITION TEAM FOR OBAMA/BIDEN 2009 AND THEN CEO TO CLINTON FOUNDATION? A LITTLE INCESTUOUS DON T YA THINK? Podesta tells Tanden the mole is Eric Braverman to which she replies,  Holy Moses! Eric Braverman was the CEO Of the Clinton Foundation. He abruptly resigned a short time later after being pushed out by long-time Clinton loyalists who had apparently grown very comfortable with the status quo of accepting donations from questionable foreign donors.Rumors are he fled the country WE CANNOT CONFIRMMore on Braverman:In December [2014], the board of the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation approved a salary of more than $395,000, plus bonus, for its Yale-educated CEO, Eric Braverman, while voting to extend his board term through 2017, according to sources familiar with the arrangement. Braverman, who had worked with Chelsea Clinton at the prestigious McKinsey & Company consultancy, had been brought in with the former first daughter s support to help impose McKinsey-like management rigor to a foundation that had grown into a $2 billion charitable powerhouse.But in January, only weeks after the board s show of support and just a year and a half after Braverman arrived, he abruptly resigned, and sources tell Politico his exit stemmed partly from a power struggle inside the foundation between and among the coterie of Clinton loyalists who have surrounded the former president for decades and who helped start and run the foundation. Some, including the president s old Arkansas lawyer Bruce Lindsey, who preceded Braverman as CEO, raised concerns directly to Bill Clinton about the reforms implemented by Braverman, according to sources, and felt themselves marginalized by the growing influence of Chelsea Clinton and the new CEO she had helped recruit.The previously untold saga of Braverman s brief, and occasionally fraught tenure trying to navigate the Clintons  insular world highlights the challenges the family has faced trying to impose rigorous oversight onto a vast global foundation that relies on some of the same loyal megadonors Hillary Clinton will need for the presidential run sources have said she is all but certain to launch later this year.Already, a spate of recent news stories in Politico and elsewhere have highlighted questions about the foundation s aggressive fundraising both before and during Braverman s tenure, including the news that the foundation had been accepting contributions from foreign governments with lax oversight from the State Department when Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. The foundation has been Clinton s main public platform since she left State in February 2013.The hiring a few months later of Braverman, who had been a partner in McKinsey s Washington office, was seen as validation of Chelsea Clinton s view that the foundation needed to address recommendations from a 2011 audit for tighter governance and budgeting, as well as more comprehensive policies to vet donors and avoid conflicts of interest.When Braverman arrived to replace Lindsey as CEO, he moved quickly to adopt the auditor s recommendations, and then some. He diversified the foundation s board beyond the Clintons and their longtime political allies and restructured its finance department. He oversaw the creation of a $250 million endowment and implemented data-driven analytics to measure the effectiveness of foundation programs.No public explanation was offered for Braverman s resignation.",politics,"Oct 25, 2016",3477

 BOMBSHELL: Senate Intel Committee Hearing Reveals FRIGHTENING Extent Of Russia’s Meddling,"While the House Intelligence Committee s investigation into Russia s interference in our political process is a mess, the Senate Intelligence Committee is busily working together to conduct their own investigation in as impartial a manner as possible. And today s open hearing revealed a kicker: Russia s meddling with the U.S. government did not stop with the 2016 election.It s actually still going on.Clinton Watts, a senior fellow at the Center for Cyber and Homeland Security, said: This past week we observed social media campaigns targeting speaker of the House Paul Ryan hoping to foment further unrest amongst US democratic institutions. He went on to tell the Senate Intel panel this: They were in full swing during both the Republican and Democratic primary season   and may have helped sink the hopes of candidates more hostile to Russian interests long before the field narrowed. Sen. Rubio, in my opinion, you anecdotally suffered from these efforts. CNN acknowledges that today s hearing may well not be anything like as explosive as James Comey s statement to the House that the FBI is, in fact, investigating Trump for possible collusion with Russia during the election. However, this hearing is focused on Russia s disinformation campaign, which vice-chairman Mark Warner said was a deliberate attempt to undermine our elections.Yesterday, both Warner and Richard Burr, the committee s chairman, said that the committee had an unprecedented number of documents from Congress   Gang of Eight,  which usually severely restricts access to just such information. The Senate Intel Committee is busy trying to learn as much as it can before it calls in high-profile witnesses such as Paul Manafort, Carter Page, and even Jared Kushner and Michael Flynn.They have a list of 20 witnesses they plan to call in so far, but they haven t set dates as to when those witnesses will come in.

 ‘Turn The Lights Off!’: Spicer Literally Hid In the Bushes From Reporters After Trump Fired Comey,"Brave White House press secretary Sean Spicer had an odd appropriate reaction after his boss abruptly fired the man who was leading an investigation into his administration s ties to Russia. Spicer had just finished a brief interview with Fox Business from the White House grounds late Tuesday night then he took cover in the bushes to avoid questions, according to The Washington Post. Spicer huddled with his staff behind a tall hedge. To get back to his office, Spicer would have to pass a swarm of reporters wanting to know why Trump abruptly fired FBI director James Comey.The White House press secretary had to get back to his office somehow but to do that he needed to pass a swarm of reporters.Spicer and his staff turned themselves into pretzels for hours in an attempt to defend Trump s bizarre decision to fire Comey.The Washington Post reports:Spicer had wanted to drop the bombshell news in an emailed statement, but it was not transmitting quickly enough, so he ended up standing in the doorway of the press office around 5:40 p.m. and shouting a statement to reporters who happened to be nearby. He then vanished, with his staff locking the door leading to his office. The press staff said that Spicer might do a briefing, then announced that he definitely wouldn t say anything more that night. But as Democrats and Republicans began to criticize and question the firing with increasing levels of alarm, Spicer and two prominent spokeswomen were suddenly speed-walking up the White House drive to defend the president on CNN, Fox News and Fox Business.Between appearances, Spicer spent several minutes hidden in the bushes, as one does when their boss is totally not guilty. Janet Montesi, an executive assistant in the press office, emerged from the bushes (and this does not look suspicious at all) and told reporters that Spicer would answer some questions, as long as they did not film him. That s when Spicer came out of his safe place to face questions from reporters. Just turn the lights off. Turn the lights off,  Spicer demanded.  We ll take care of this.   Can you just turn that light off? Spicer s wish was granted and he found himself standing in near darkness between two tall hedges, with more than a dozen reporters closely gathered around him. For 10 minutes, he responded to a flurry of questions.Spicer had to answer questions as he stammered and hemmed and hawed. Spicer was asked when Trump and Comey spoke? last.  Uh, I don t know.

SOMALI PIRATE POSING AS A “REFUGEE” Found Covered In Blood After Stabbing Roommate 19 Times In German Government Funded Housing,"Apparently free housing, food and spending money wasn t enough for this murderous thug posing as a helpless refugee A Somali pirate who was in jail in France for seven years has been jailed for another eleven years in Germany after murdering a fellow African while pretending to be an  asylum seeker  in a Berlin invader camp.The astonishing story of the 35-year-old African invader has been revealed in the Potsdam, Berlin-based M rkische Allgemeine newspaper.The Somali who has still not been named, apparently by court order provided an astonishing story which dramatically illustrated how hordes of fraudsters have taken advantage of deluded European liberals to invade and parasite off Europe.He entered Germany in May this year and joined in the general rush to claim asylum, the M rkische Allgemeine reported.The German liberals immediately gave him housing, food, and welfare money. He received an apartment which he shared with another African  asylum seeker  from Somalia in a building on the Potsdamer Strasse in Teltow (Potsdam-Mittelmark).He fell out with his flatmate, a 21-year-old, and in a murderous frenzy, stabbed him nineteen times, cutting his carotid artery. The 35-year-old fled the scene, but was easily spotted on the streets a few blocks away not only because of his skin color, but also because he was drenched in his murder victim s blood.The Potsdam regional court found him guilty of the latest murder and rejected his plea of manslaughter, saying that the nature of the victim s wounds showed clear premeditation. He was sentenced to eleven-and-half-years in jail.During the court proceedings, his pretrial statements to the police were read out, and his incredible story emerged. In these statements, the Somali admitted to the police that he had previously been jailed in France for seven years after being convicted of piracy off the horn of Africa.In addition, he said, he had killed another inmate while in prison in France, and upon his release, he had simply crossed the border into Germany, thrown away his identification papers, and joined the asylum queue in Berlin.The lack of identification papers is also the reason why the court has not ordered his name to be released because they do not know his real name or even his actual age.The court found that he had documents which gave two different birth dates, and he himself had claimed a third, while he had been registered in the German asylum system under three different names.The latter maneuver is an old trick used by Third World swindlers in Europe to triple their welfare benefits, and is a growing problem with the latest wave of incomers.Nonetheless, the Somali s successful exploitation of the  asylum system wrecked only by his murderous behavior serves as a perfect case study in the criminal nature of the Third World invasion and of the stupidity of leftist Europeans in allowing the  asylum  racket to continue.

 Hypocrite Republicans Refuse To Investigate Flynn Scandal,"After years of investigating Hillary Clinton over Benghazi despite her resignation, Republicans are hypocritically refusing to investigate Michael Flynn.Donald Trump s national security adviser Michael Flynn resigned late on Monday night after getting busted for negotiating with the Russians while President Obama was still in office.Flynn s actions violated the Logan Act, which bars citizens from negotiating with foreign powers. Flynn s connections with Vladimir Putin run deep, and the Justice Department warned Trump last month that Flynn was at risk of being blackmailed by the Russians. Still, Trump kept Flynn on his team and even let him continue participating in meetings.Flynn, the national security adviser, was literally a national security threat and Trump refused to act.This comes months after an election that was tainted by interference from the Russians, and Republicans have yet to investigate that.And they are not going to investigate the Flynn scandal either.GOP Rep. Jason Chaffetz told reporters on Tuesday,  I think that situation has taken care of itself. I think he did the right thing stepping down. By that logic, the Benghazi investigation should have ended after Clinton stepped down as Secretary of State in February 2013. But Republicans continued the investigation into December 2016.Chaffetz then passed the buck by claiming that the House Intelligence Committee is responsible for investigating Flynn, not the Oversight Committee.When asked by reporters if he would launch an investigation, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes said he doesn t plan to do so and even went on to praise Flynn in the hope that the scandal will be swept under the rug.Here s the lawmaker who should be investigating Flynn and Trump s Russia ties, House Intel Chair Devin Nunes.Really taking this seriously. pic.twitter.com/ygfiajpYq3  Matt Fuller (@MEPFuller) February 14, 2017And so, Republicans once again demonstrate that they are complete hypocrites.Republicans like Chaffetz spent years and wasted millions of taxpayer dollars to investigate Hillary Clinton over Benghazi. It was a witch hunt that went beyond the amount of time Congress spent investigating 9/11 and in the end it found nothing.Republicans literally accused Clinton of  national security malpractice  even though it was their cuts of diplomatic security funding that played a role in the lack of security at the consulate.Nothing Hillary Clinton could have done in response would have saved the four Americans who died in the attack. Furthermore, there have been even deadlier terrorist attacks against American embassies overseas that did not result in investigations, especially when such attacks occurred under Republican administrations.But Michael Flynn broke the law, lied about his phone calls with the Russian ambassador, and was a national security threat because of his closeness to the Russians, particularly Putin, and was at risk of being blackmailed.This is a major scandal of the Trump administration and the American people are demanding a lengthy and thorough investigation by Congress. The fact that Republicans don t want to do it shows how little credibility these lawmakers have. They don t really care about our national security. They only care about launching investigations for political gain.They are hypocrites and they should be ousted from office in favor of people who will conduct a proper investigation into this matter. And when that investigation exposes Trump s collusion with Russia we ll all know why Republicans didn t want to investigate Flynn. Because protecting the party is more important to them than protecting America.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"February 14, 2017",3714
 Learn The FACTS About What The FBI Is Saying Concerning Hillary’s Emails; Trump LYING (DETAILS),"The media everywhere seems to be jumping on the new revelation of Hillary Clinton s emails without actually reading what was written by FBI Director James Comey.While Donald Trump, alongside pretty much every mainstream media branch, is saying that the FBI is  reopening  the investigation, that s not at all what was written.Comey, doing his due diligence and informing Congress that new emails had been discovered, sent the following letter: In previous congressional testimony, I referred to the fact that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had completed its investigation of former Secretary Clinton s personal email server. Due to recent developments, I am writing to supplement my previous testimony. Note the word  supplement. He continued: In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation. I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that they FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to out investigation. In other words, they are looking at them to determine if they should include them in the previous investigation. Which is solidified with this next point: Although the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant, and I cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work, I believe it is important to update your Committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony. In other words, Comey is being completely transparent as the emails are looked at, but he never said the investigation is being reopened. Rather, the additional emails that were found are being assessed to see if they need to be subject to further scrutiny.In addition:BREAKING: US official: Newly discovered emails related to Clinton investigation did not come from her private server.

Did anyone really expect her to have anything of value to say on the subject, or is Stein being used by the media so viewers will play clips of the incredibly ignorant and hilarious comments Stein during the MSNBC interview over and over again. You know, kind of like a cheap marketing campaign.Crazy Lil  Kim, and before him, his father, have been flexing their nuclear muscle for years. There is clearly a dominant crazy gene in that family and to ignore it or pretend they are somehow victims of the US, now that they appear to have nuclear missiles capable of hitting Chicago, Los Angeles or Denver would be almost as stupid as Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein.Watch:WATCH: @DrJillStein: North Korea has been demonized by US, forced to attain Nukes.

FORMER MEXICAN PREZ Sends “Middle Finger” To TRUMP Days Before “Apology”: “Don’t play around with us…We can jump walls…We can swim rivers…And we can defend ourselves”,"Wow these sound exactly like the type of people we want living next door to us. It s not so hard to see why so many Americans are enthusiastic about Trump s promise to build the wall BUILD THE WALL!The Huffington Post has published a photograph (above) of former Mexican president Vicente Fox giving Donald Trump the finger, taken a day before Fox apologized to Trump in an interview with Breitbart News.The photograph was originally shared on social media by Ben Mathis, host of the KickAss Politics podcast, which interviewed Fox last Tuesday. Breitbart News interviewed Fox the following day in Santa Monica, California.Mathis posted the photograph with the message:  Vicente Fox & I have a message for Donald Trump. Listen to a preview of his most controversial interview yet, recorded just one day before his apology to Trump aired on Breitbart. On Twitter, KickAss politics teased the interview as Fox  responding  to Trump   though the two had already responded to each other, with Fox apologizing via Breitbart and Trump accepting the apology the following day.KickAss politics also added the  NeverTrump  hashtag.In most controversial interview yet @VicenteFoxQue responds to @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/9AYIuVmJoo #NeverTrump pic.twitter.com/jFRkw5o8I7  Kickass News (@KickassNewsPod) May 9, 2016According to Huffington Post overnight editor Ed Mazza, Fox told Mathis that Trump is an  ugly American  and  hated gringo,  and reiterated that he would not pay for the  fucking wall  on the border, adding:  And please don t take out the  fucking  full word. Mazza adds:In the Kickass Politics conversation, Fox was anything but apologetic. He called the presumptive Republican presidential nominee  crazy  and a  false prophet,  and compared him to Latin American demagogues who  destroy economies.  He also said some of Trump s proposals could lead to war. Don t play around with us,  Fox said.  We can jump walls. We can swim rivers. And we can defend ourselves. The following day, Fox told Breitbart:  I apologize. Forgiveness is one of the greatest qualities that human beings have, is the quality of a compassionate leader. You have to be humble. You have to be compassionate. You have to love thy neighbor.

 Hannity Gets His A** Kicked By Newsweek For Lying Constantly And Insulting People With Epilepsy,"Sean Hannity is definitely going to blow a gasket about this.In recent weeks, major mainstream media outlets have been slamming the Fox News host for pushing lie after lie after lie in his effort to get Donald Trump elected in November.First, Jon Stewart came out of retirement for one night to slam Hannity so hard for being a hypocrite when it comes to the way he has treated Trump versus the shitty way he has treated President Obama that the conservative host could hardly stammer his way through an angry response to the comedian the next day.And then Hannity threw a hissy fit after Wall Street Journal foreign affairs columnist Bret Stephens called him  Fox News  dumbest anchor  for attacking Republican leaders for not blindly supporting Trump no matter what he does.Then CNN host Brian Stelter took Hannity to the woodshed for helping Trump claim that the election is rigged for Hillary Clinton.And if that weren t enough, the Washington Post also dealt Hannity a major rebuke for lying about Trump rescuing stranded Marines after the Gulf War came to a close.Now Hannity just got his ass handed to him by Newsweek over his constant stream of lies and the fact that he insulted people with epilepsy by questioning Hillary Clinton s health.Kurt Eichenwald absolutely destroyed Hannity in a published column and it s clear that he just smacked Hannity in the face with a gauntlet. HARD.A man who purports to be a dutiful Catholic, Hannity has made a career out of violating the ninth commandment (or eighth in his faith) against lying about others. If Hannity stopped vomiting up falsehoods, his program would be nothing but a test pattern. From him and the others in the  Who cares if it s false?  conservative media camp, we have heard over the decades that Hillary and Bill Clinton murdered many people, that the Bush administration found weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, that Obama could be on the verge of declaring martial law, and on and on.They are pretend journalists pumping out propaganda to scared, foolish people.Eichenwald then took Hannity to task for telling his audience that Hillary may have had a seizure in a video which shows Clinton  Being pulled in different directions by multiple speakers at once, Clinton playfully acted like a bobblehead doll, smiling and then speaking after the joke was over. But Hannity characterized Clinton s playfulness as a serious medical condition, which Eichenwald did NOT appreciate.I know this response to Sean Hannity is a little raw, but as someone with epilepsy, I hope my editors will let this slip through: Fuck you, Sean. Your willingness to deceive your viewers to degrade those of us with epilepsy, to suggest something is a seizure when it looks nothing like one, to leave people dumber about this condition is unforgivable.It is rare for a mainstream journalist to use such strong language, but Hannity certainly deserved it. And that was only the beginning.Eichenwald went on to talk about what a real seizure is, explaining: People do not smile during a seizure while standing upright and then immediately launch into a coherent sentence. There s no smiling because, if for some reason the person experiencing the seizure has not collapsed to the ground in unconsciousness, the moment the body begins to move uncontrollably is terrifying. After a seizure, someone does not instantly jump back into a conversation, making jokes. Eichenwald then delivered the final blow.While I know you almost never apologize for anything you do on the air, this sin requires some penance. It can be done in secret if you don t have the character to make a public pronouncement of regret. Write a check. Make a donation to help those you demeaned and damaged if you are unable to show the backbone to undo the damage you have done, you can understand why I say you  purport  to be a Catholic. If you really were one, you d be worried about burning in hell for what you ve done.Thus far, Sean Hannity has not responded nor has he thrown a temper tantrum over Eichenwald basically putting him over his knee and giving his an ass-whipping. But you can bet one will probably happen soon as Hannity has a thin skin just like Donald Trump.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"August 15, 2016",4222
IRAN MAY HAVE RECEIVED Over $33 Billion In Cash AND Gold From Obama,"Iran may have received an additional $33.6 billion in secret cash and gold payments facilitated by the Obama administration between 2014 and 2016, according to testimony provided before Congress by an expert on last summer s nuclear agreement with Iran.Between January 2014 and July 2015, when the Obama administration was hammering out the final details of the nuclear accord, Iran was paid $700 million every month from funds that had previously been frozen by U.S. sanctions.A total of $11.9 billion was ultimately paid to Iran, but the details surrounding these payments remain shrouded in mystery, according to Mark Dubowitz, executive director at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.In total,  Iran may have received as much as $33.6 billion in cash or in gold and other precious metals,  Dubowitz disclosed.New questions about these payments are emerging following confirmation from top Obama administration officials on Thursday that it was forced to pay Iran $1.7 billion in cash prior to the release of several U.S. hostages earlier this year. The administration insisted that cash had to be used for this payment.Read more: WFB",politics,"Sep 8, 2016",1144
"WATCH: KELLYANNE CONWAY Gives Dreaded Answer To Liberal Hack, “This Week” Host George Stephanopoulos’ Question About Trump’s Plans To Run In 2020","ABC host George Stephanopoulos sat down with Kellyanne Conway for an interview this morning on  This Week . Stephanopoulos started out the interview by mentioning the new jobs report and the explosion of the stock market under President Trump. He barely took a breath before he jumped directly to a poll that showed despite all of his many accomplishments, that Trump isn t very popular. Kellyanne Conway was quick to point out, that although Trump s poll numbers aren t as strong as she d like them to be, he s keeping his head down and focusing on his agenda. In other words, President Trump is laser focused on honoring the campaign promises he made to American people who elected him. What a novel idea One can only imagine the disappointment Stephanopoulos must have felt when he got the dreaded answer from Conway to his question about President Trump s plans to run in 2020. After all, who could forget when George Stephanopoulos  wife promised (but of course, didn t follow through) that she would move her family to another country if President Trump won the election?Watch:Conway responded to Stephanopoulos  question about Trump running in 2020:  The president says privately and publicly, often, George that he ll be president for seven and a half more years, so he plans on being a two-term president. Last week, the New York Times article attempted to convince their readers that the Republican Party is divided and fractured and that many of the members of the party were attempting to convince Vice President Mike Pence to run for president in 2020.Pence was furious at the accusation that he was somehow involved in a potential coup against President Trump. So much for the wishful thinking of not very credible and very biased New York Times.And finally, it wouldn t be an interview with the mainstream media if they didn t ask about Trump s phony Russia connection. Kellyanne Conway didn t disappoint with her answer as she blasted Stephanopoulos for pushing the fake narrative:  People just can t get over that election, George. It s corrosive to our body politic ",left-news,"Aug 6, 2017",2084
 New Audio Tapes Reveal Trump Called His Pregnant Wife A’Blimp’ And A ‘Monster’,"It turns out that there are more than just one audio recording out there where you can hear Donald Trump saying terribly misogynistic things. Around the same period a hot mic caught Donald Trump bragging about using his fame to sexually assault women in 2005, he also did an interview with Howard Stern where he said some very creepy and misogynistic things about his wife and daughter. This includes a bit of audio where Trump told Stern that it was okay for the shock DJ to call his daughter a piece of ass.  My daughter is beautiful, Ivanka,  says Trump during the interview.  By the way, your daughter,  says Stern. She s beautiful,  responds Trump. Can I say this? A piece of ass,  Stern responds. Yeah,  says Trump.During the show, Trump also called his wife Melania Trump a  monster  and a  blimp.   According to Trump he meant this to be a positive statement. That s because he was referring to Melania s breasts.  Like a blimp   in the right places. In her case, the right places. I mean she really has become a monster   in all the right places. I mean monster in the most positive way. She has gotten very, very large   in all the right places. Donald Trump s mouth is costing him big. It seems as if every hour another elected Republican has denounced Trump after Friday s release of the now infamous audio that has Trump s campaign burning in flames. Several have called for him to drop out of the race altogether. Even Mike Pence, his running mate had some sharp words for his electoral wingman. Funding halts suggest the RNC is prepared to stop supporting the Republican presidential nominee altogether. From now until the election   or Trump actually does end up dropping out   more skeletons from Trump s past are going to come out and consume his campaign. Remember just last week when it was revealed that Trump probably has not paid any income taxes in nearly two decades? The scandals just do not end with this loser. His campaign is toast. The fact that he has managed to stay as strong as he has in the race is a sad commentary on the state of the U.S. politics.   Trump, do yourself a favor and drop out already. It s only going to get worse from you from here on out.Featured image from Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"October 9, 2016",2236
 The Internet Loses It Over RNC’s Bizarre Statement About A ‘New King’ (TWEETS),"The Republican National Committee released a bizarre Christmas statement comparing president-elect Donald Trump to a  King.  We can recall all those times conservatives mocked our president, calling him  King Obama  so the irony is not lost on anyone. Over two millennia ago, a new hope was born into the world, a Savior who would offer the promise of salvation to all mankind,  RNC chairman Reince Priebus and co-chair Sharon Day wrote in the statement.  Just as the three wise men did on that night, this Christmas heralds a time to celebrate the good news of a new King. We hope Americans celebrating Christmas today will enjoy a day of festivities and a renewed closeness with family and friends.  (my emphasis)Some conservatives on Twitter defended the statement saying it was referring to Jesus, but most people did not. The odd wording that was used seems to indicate the RNC is referring to Trump.

Even as we celebrate, we must also remember those among us who are less fortunate. Many on this day are without hope, and need the kindness and compassion of those around them.

Many are stationed around the world today protecting our freedoms, and cannot be with their own spouses, children, parents, and siblings,  the message continues.  We express the deepest gratitude for service that takes them away from celebrating with loved ones, and we ought to remember them in our thoughts and prayers not just on Christmas Day, but the whole year round.

 Anti-Porn GOP Florida Lawmaker Was Just Caught Porning On Twitter,"The GOP has a thing for porn. In 2016, Sen. Todd Weiler introduced legislation asking his state to recognize that porn is creating a public health hazard and Republicans thought that was a cool idea. Well, now it s 2017 and a Florida lawmaker who filed a similar proposal was just busted favoriting a porn tweet. You could say he got Ted Cruzed.Just a few days ago, State Rep. Ross Spano filed a bill to declare pornography a public health crisis in Florida, but from his Twitter account, it appears he  liked  a pornographic tweet.According to the Orlando Weekly, the Republican s list of likes on Twitter is typically football clips, Bible verses, and GOP-related content about how evil Islam is. But, nestled into his  likes  list is a tweet from Jan. 8 by the  Goddess Lesbian  Twitter account, which features a video clip from adult entertainment company Reality Kings. On that same day, Spano liked a Biblical quote-tweet from Franklin Graham but we re not sure if that was before or after he was watching lesbians having sexy-time in front of the camera.Screenshot!This wouldn t matter in the least except for the bill Spano filled, HR157, which the Orlando Weekly notes is  incredibly harsh on adult content  and he left that  liked  porn tweet up for nine months. It appears to be deleted now. Franklin Graham s liked tweet is still there, though.The bill, which is contrary to research, states that  recent research indicates that pornography is potentially biologically addictive, resulting in the user consuming increasingly more shocking material to satisfy the addiction,  and adds,  Pornography has a detrimental effect on families and is linked to a reluctance to enter into marriage, dissatisfaction in marriage and marital infidelity. Spano says he didn t do it. It wasn t him being horny on Twitter.Obviously, I have a long social media history on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram since I was first elected in 2012. With a thorough examination of my accounts, it will be easy to see that this is not my doing. I have since gone back, once notified, and rectified the problem. And I m now looking into how it occurred in the first place.In addition, referencing my prior statement, I don t believe any of this takes the focus off of the fact that there is a direct correlation between pornography and a host of societal problems, including human trafficking, exploitation of children, sex slavery, and domestic violence.Sure, it wasn t Spano, it must have been that other Spano guy with the same Twitter account and password. Sounds legit!Image via YouTube screen capture.",News,"September 21, 2017",2590
"BREAKING: ISIS May Have Stolen Passport Machine, Making Unlawful Entry To U.S. Easy","At $200 a pop even a poor jihadi can find a new home in America U.S. intelligence officials are warning that the Islamic State terrorist group may have seized an official government passport printing machine and a trove of blank passports in Syria and could be printing fake passports that would allow some of its followers to infiltrate the U.S. border.The terror group has reportedly been able to print legitimate-looking Syrian passports since taking over the city of Deir ez-Zour last summer, home to a passport office with  boxes of blank passports  and a passport printing machine, according to a Homeland Security Investigations Intelligence Report issued to law enforcement last week and reviewed by ABC news.Another passport office was located in Raqqa, Syria, where the terror group has long maintained its de facto capital. Since more than 17 months [have] passed since Raqqa and Deir ez-Zour fell to ISIS, it is possible that individuals from Syria with passports  issued  in these ISIS controlled cities or who had passport blanks, may have traveled to the U.S.,  the report says, ABC reported.FBI Director James Comey admitted the U.S. intelligence community was concerned about the problem in testimony before Congress on Wednesday. The intelligence community is concerned that they [ISIS] have the ability, the capability to manufacture fraudulent passports, which is a concern in any setting,  Mr. Comey said.Fake Syrian passports have already been discovered in Europe, most notably two used by suicide bombers in the Paris attacks last month.According to the source that provided the passport information to homeland security officials, Syria is awash in fake documents. The source further stated that fake Syrian passports are so prevalent in Syria that Syrians do not even view possessing them as illegal,  the report says, according to ABC.  The source stated fake Syrian passports can be obtained in Syria for $200 to $400 and that backdated passport stamps to be placed in the passport cost the same. The report included one example in which law enforcement officials said that a Syrian passport discovered in Turkey was printed with a designator number indicating it had been printed in an ISIS-controlled area earlier this year.The last page of the report warns,  If ISIS ability to produce passports is not controlled, their operations will continue to increase and expand outside of their operational controlled areas.

"OBAMA’S RACISM CZAR, “REVEREND” AL SHARPTON CALLS FOR FEDERAL POLICE FORCE","Yeah putting the federal government in charge of our entire police force, sounds like a great idea Al. We re waiting for Al to call for an all black police force next you know, in the name of  fairness. Rev. Al Sharpton called for national policing legislation akin to the Civil Rights Act this morning at the kickoff his National Action Network s annual convention, just after the arrest of a white South Carolina police officer for murder in the shooting of an unarmed black man. There must be national policy and national law on policing,  Mr. Sharpton said.  We can t go from state to state, we ve got to have national law to protect people against these continued questions. Mr. Sharpton s comments, coming on the heels of multiple instances of police killings of unarmed men of color around the country, were met with applause from the crowd and from the dais, which was packed with elected officials including Mayor Bill de Blasio, Congressman Charles Rangel, Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, city Comptroller Scott Stringer and state Comptroller Thomas DiNapoliThe convention kickoff, which featured a ribbon cutting with the lawmakers, came just hours after it was announced last night that North Charleston, S.C., police officer Michael T. Slager would be charged with murder in the death of Walter Scott who can be seen in a widely publicized video running away from Mr. Slager, while the officer shoots into the man s back repeatedly. The video offers a markedly different story than the one Mr. Slager first offered up: that Scott had stolen his taser and left him in fear for his life.Mr. Sharpton praised the city s mayor and police chief for bringing the charges, but said the nation couldn t rely on the judgement of local officials. We commend them, but we cannot have a justice system that hopes we have a mayor in the right city or a police chief,  he said.  We have to have one policy that is national. Mr. Sharpton later noted that the comparatively small town s officials had been braver than police leaders in bigger cities. He has been vocal about his belief that New York City police Daniel Pantaleo should have been charged with a crime in the death of an unarmed black Staten Island man, Eric Garner. A grand jury declined to indict Mr. Pantaleo, spurring protests throughout the city.That death, too, was captured in a widely published video. And though the footage did not lead to any charges, Mr. Sharpton said today the national legislation should focus on  cameras  as well as  accountability. He compared the fight for police reform to the civil rights struggle, noting that activists did not try to fix discrimination in individual states or cities. They fought for a national Civil Rights Act, a national Voting Rights Act. It s time for this country to have national policing,  Mr. Sharpton said.After the ribbon cutting, Mr. de Blasio whose first year in office was dominated by an effort to reform police-community relations after Garner s death and a subsequent City Hall feud with police union leadership said he agreed some kind of national standard should be set. It s a broad point he s making, and I think he way he made the analogy to the Voting Rights Act is the right one. We ve got to figure out how to create the right relationship between police and community,  Mr. de Blasio told reporters.  The vast majority of police do their job well and want to work more closely with the community. Obviously community residents want to work more closely with the police. But we have to create more of a national standard that says we all have to be on the same page. The relationship between Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Sharpton was fodder for his woes with police unions last year: they took umbrage when Mr. Sharpton was seated next to the mayor and Police Commissioner Bill Bratton at a City Hall round table, and dismissed Mr. Sharpton as divisive. A poll later showed voters didn t like the approaches of either Mr. Sharpton or the union leaders and rank-and-file officers who later turned their backs on Mr. de Blasio at the funeral for two slain officers.Today, Mr. Sharpton offered a full-throated defense his relationship with the mayor, saying it was based not on political power but on a long history of working together, citing Mr. de Blasio s support on issues like wage increases and the silent march against stop, question and frisk before his election. He marched with us when other candidates wouldn t. So don t begrudge us for knowing somebody that we always knew, and that was there in the trenches with us,  Mr. Sharpton said, saying he had never asked for favors or back room deals only access and policy changes.  There s nothing in the back room we want. We want everything out front. Via: The Observer",politics,"Apr 9, 2015",4764
Message to President Trump from Syria’s Assad: ‘You Also Need Our Help to Defeat Terrorism’,"21st Century Wire says The following interview is the first western media appearance by Syrian President Bashar al Assad since Donald Trump took office in the US. In an exclusive interview with Yahoo News at the president s office in Damascus, Assad said President Trump s freeze on refugees into his country   part of an executive order that has drawn widespread protests and is being challenged in federal court    is an American issue  on which he would not take sides. But asked if some of those who fled are  aligned with terrorists,  Assad quickly replied,  Definitely. What is clear from this interview is that the President Assad has a much deeper and more realistic understanding of the real threat of terrorism, and the causes of terrorism   far and away beyond the shallow, childish rhetoric we hear on a daily basis from those US officials still openly supporting radical Islamist terrorists in Syria like US Senators like John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Bob Corker and other who are still clinging to the fictional narrative of the  moderate rebel  in Syria. It is also clear that Assad has a much more intelligent handle on the concept of  safe zones  than the Trump Administration so far, as well as a better understanding of the totality of refugee issue, who Assad said is partly fuelled by the crippling sanctions imposed by the US.

 Carly Fiorina: Ted Cruz’s Chances Of Winning Are As Real As Those Planned Parenthood Videos,"It s now official. Carly Fiorina needs help. I m talking real, pharmaceutical-grade, billed at $400 an hour professional help, because she s seeing things that are not there again. This is just like that time she screamed like a banshee that she totally really did see live fetuses getting cut to bits in those Planned Parenthood videos, which were so obviously fake that not even other Republicans talk about them anymore.Megyn Kelly invited Fiorina onto her show to ask her just why in God s name she agreed to be, of all people, Ted Cruz s vice presidential candidate. He s the only person that Republicans genuinely hate more than Trump, yet she thought this was a good idea. So, what s the deal?Kelly asked Fiorina why she chose Cruz when he has no chance at securing the nomination by a majority of delegates. Fiorina immediately insisted that her math (this is the imaginary stuff now) says that Ted Cruz can win. She even blamed the media for this by saying they just wish it would be over and he [Trump] would be the GOP nominee. Here s some non-Carly math. Cruz has 562 delegates. He needs 1,237 to win. There are 578 still available. Even if he won 100 percent of all remaining ones he comes up nearly 100 delegates short. It s mathematically impossible for Ted Cruz to  win  and avoid a contested primary, yet she still said she believes Ted will win the nomination based on numbers only she can see.Carly Fiorina actually said that the majority of Republicans do not want Trump to win, to which Megyn Kelly just stared with a look of pity and bewilderment. Trump has beaten Cruz by up to 40 percent in the popular vote in some states recently. Apparently that isn t a majority anymore.Kelly then went on to point out that even though Trump isn t exactly the favorite of the party, there is no alternative. Cruz is still in it, but nobody is uniting behind him to stop Trump. Of course, Fiorina responded by telling Kelly she was wrong because there s a huge line of supporters flocking to Cruz   which again only she can see.Carly either sees things that do not actually exist, or she intentionally lies. I don t really know which is worse, but she thinks this qualifies her to be our next vice president.It s 2008 all over again. We have another mentally flawed person in the VP seat for Republicans   except this time, it s so bad she won t even get to the general election. Carly Fiorina should think long and hard about that.

HEY DEMOCRATS! Judicial Watch Just Discovered Hillary Invited Putin To 2009 Clinton Foundation Gala…Is This The Collusion You’ve Been Looking For?,"The March 13, 2009, email from the Clinton Foundation showed that Putin and about 200 other leaders (including others just as controversial) were invited to attend a gathering that occurred at about the same time that the newly appointed secretary of state was attempting a  reset  with Moscow.The email, which was sent from Clinton Foundation director of foreign policy Amitabh Desai to Assistant Secretary of State Andrew Shapiro and then forwarded to top Clinton aide Jake Sullivan, also highlights the potential massive conflict of interest between a non-profit foundation and the federal government.Even after losing the election, Clinton has continued on the warpath against President Trump s stance on Russia. He doesn t just like Putin, he wants to be like Putin,  Clinton said of Trump on MSNBC s Rachel Maddow show Thursday night.But as secretary of state, Clinton took pains to engage with the Kremlin. Just one week prior to sending out the invites, Hillary flew to Geneva and presented the Russian foreign minister with an actual  reset button  to symbolize a new beginning in U.S.-Russia relations.Beyond the Putin invite, many serious conflicts of interests arose from the sitting secretary of state s invite list.Judicial Watch explains further:The list includes dignitaries from Saudi Arabia, which gave $14.5 million to the Clinton Foundation; Kuwait, which gave between $5 and $10 million; Oman, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar   all of which donated between $1 and $5 million over the years. In February 2015, the Washington Post reported,  A third of foundation donors who have given more than $1 million are foreign governments or other entities   and foreign donors make up more than half of those who have given more than $5 million.

 Ann Coulter: Trump Doesn’t Need GOP’s Support – ‘He IS The Party’ (VIDEO),"Conservative columnist Ann Coulter took her vomit-inducing support of Donald Trump onto MSNBC yesterday to argue that the presumptive Republican nominee shouldn t even bother trying to convince prominent GOPers like House Speaker Paul Ryan to support him. She said it was a complete waste of the business mogul s time because he pretty much owns the GOP and represents the  heart and soul  of the Republican party now.As the discussion about Trump s Thursday meeting with Ryan was being discussed, host Chris Matthews wondered what might actually convince Ryan to support a presidential candidate that he was clearly having reservations about   and who could blame him?! Coulter shrugged this off and laughed, asserting her opinion that Trump was only having this meeting with Ryan out of the goodness of his heart. Coulter told Matthews: It shows that Trump is being unbelievably gracious. He doesn t need to have this meeting [with Paul Ryan]. He is the party. He is the heart and soul of the party. Pointing out just how incredibly  gracious  this stunt by Trump is, she told Matthews that he could have just said,  hope he comes aboard, we re gonna have a lot of fun, but if he doesn t, oh well  after Ryan withheld his endorsement.To make Coulter s appearance on the show even more outrageous, she made sure to promote her new book, In Trump We Trust. She said that in the future, she hoped that Trump wouldn t waste any more of his precious time convincing the GOP to back him. The people are with him, and there s no point in meeting with all these generals without armies. According to Ryan, his meeting with Trump will be centered around  how to unify the Republican Party.  Ryan said: It s been a bitter and divisive primary. It s going to take more than one week just to repair and unify this party. Apparently, Trump thinks he s got this one in the bag.TwitterFeatured image is a screenshot",News,"May 11, 2016",1902
 Scottish Newspaper Hilariously Trolls Trump Inauguration With PERFECT TV Guide Description (IMAGE),"The Scots are geniuses when it comes to trolling Donald Trump. And this newspaper proves it.Sadly, Donald Trump s inauguration is on Friday and it is likely going to be an event that offends millions of Americans across the country as Trump makes the day all about him and attacking his critics.Trump s team has been desperate to find musical talent willing to sell their souls to Satan to sing for Trump and have only managed to get a reality show singer and a has-been band to commit.Furthermore, a massive protest against Trump has also been planned to occur at the same time. All in all, Trump s inauguration is going to be a shit show that ushers in a frightening period in American history that will impact this nation for generations as Republicans try to turn it into their own utopia where rich people and tyrants flourish while the rest of humanity suffers immeasurably.All the progress made over the last 150 years is about to go down the drain and one Scottish newspaper could only describe Trump s inauguration as the return of  The Twilight Zone. The Sunday Herald describes this newest  Twilight Zone  episode as  one of the most ambitious, expensive and controversial productions in broadcast history  featuring four years of answers to the question of what would have happened if the Nazis had won World War II.Calling the event  nightmarish,  the Sunday Herald goes on to say that Americans were unbelievably duped to make Donald Trump president. This huge virtual reality project, which will unfold on TV, in the press, and on Twitter over the next four years sets out to build on an alternative present. The story begins in a nightmarish version of 2017 in which huge sections of the US electorate have somehow been duped into voting to make Donald Trump president. It sounds far-fetched, and it is,  the description continues,  but as it goes on it becomes more and more chillingly plausible. Today s feature length opener concentrates on the gaudy inauguration of President Trump, and the stirrings of protest and despair surrounding the ceremony It s a flawed piece, but a disturbing glimpse of the horrors we could stumble into, if we re not careful.

Activist: ‘This is where you can make the most impact’,"21st Century Wire says If you ve been following the events outside of Burns, Oregon, you ll have seen 99% of the news coverage has been about the presence of  armed militia  and endless rumors of FBI  Waco Siege  plots   and not about the core legal issues surrounding the Hammond family. These stories often start out as local issues, then quickly spin out of control and end up being managed and contested at the Federal level.Sunday Wire host Patrick Henningsen spoke to independent activist Jason Casella from PANDA UNITE and the Solutions Institute about his recent experience at the Oregon Standoff, and also about America s  crisis of liberty , as well as some positive trends in activism today. Casella advocates getting closer to the sources of power and decision making in your local community: You have to make sure that your city council and county commission is acting on behalf of the people, and acting within the restraints of the Constitution, before you can ask somebody in DC, for example, or even at your state level of representatives.

 Store Owner Where Alton Sterling Was Killed Suing Baton Rouge Police,"The plot is definitely thickening when it comes to the horrific death of an African-American man at the hands of two white police officers in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Abdullah Muflahi owns the Triple S Food Mart, where the events of that fateful night took place. Now, he has filed a lawsuit against the police. The suit alleges that in the aftermath of the murder of Alton Sterling, whom Muflahi allowed to sell his CD s out front of the store, Muflahi was taken into custody like a common criminal, where the cops took his cell phone, along with surveillance video of the shooting. All of this was done without a warrant, which is definitely illegal, and reeks of a cover-up. The suit says of what happened: At all times defendants knew that plaintiff Muflahi was only a witness to the events at his store and that being a witness did not entitle police to hold plaintiff in custody or seize or commandeer his store and store equipment. Of course, the cops are not talking about these new developments. Muflahi is suing the cops who shot Sterling, as well as the city of Baton Rouge itself. Also named in the lawsuit are the investigating officers and the Baton Rouge police chief. There was no warrant for any of the store s surveillance footage until roughly five hours after the cops murdered Alton Sterling, so they had no right to immediately take that footage, and at no point should Abdullah Muflahi been taken into custody for any reason. He was a witness to a crime committed by the Baton Rouge police. He is not the criminal here.The document that requested the warrant claimed that Sterling did not put his hands on the hood of a car when he was told to do so, and therefore tasers were used. They saw what they believed to be a gun sticking out of Sterling s pocket, and therefore they tased him. Now, anyone with knowledge of tasers knows that they incapacitate the average person pretty well. There was no need to shoot and kill him, but of course the cops claim otherwise: When the subject attempted to reach for the gun from his pocket, the officers fired their police-issued duty weapon at the subject to stop the threat. I d be willing to bet they erased what footage they could, along with any video on the cell phone they unlawfully took from Abdullah Muflahi. It will be just as doctored as the stories they are telling regarding the shooting itself. This is nothing more than the police doing their damndest to keep their murderous brothers in blue out of an indictment and possible prison time.Featured image via Mark Wallheiser/Getty Images",News,"July 12, 2016",2565
 Guns In Schools Advocate Slammed By BBC Host (AUDIO),"During an interview with a BBC Live Host, a Texas gun advocate defended his state s new gun law policies by saying that the only way to stop gun violence is to arm more people. C.J. Grisham, president of the gun advocacy group Open Carry Texas and a candidate for the state senate believes that law-abiding citizens should be able to access guns easily in order to counter those who have them illegally. He said: You can pass all the background checks you want, but a criminal gang member in Chicago isn t going to run a background check on another gang member. The host then interrupted Grisham and asked:  Sorry. How many of the mass college shootings were carried out by criminal gang members? Grisham responds,  Well they were all carried out by criminals, not licensed carriers. The host then asks,  So how did those people manage to access the weaponry that led to all of those deaths then? Illegally. That s what I m saying,  said Grisham.The host continues to drill Grisham by asking,  How do you tighten that up then?  Grisham s response is ridiculous: Well, you can t stop all crime. You tighten it up by getting rid of gun-free zones and allowing people to defend themselves no matter where they walk, no matter where they go, no matter where they study. So, just to be clear, C.J.  asked the host,  The solution is actually having more guns in circulation in America. Therefore, when a Columbine happens, a teacher can open fire in a classroom against the assailant. So, guns in classrooms? You advocate that? Well, there s already guns in classrooms. It s just that they re in the hands of criminals and the good guys can t defend themselves,  said Grisham.The guns used in the Columbine shooting were bought from an unlicensed private seller.  The guns: Were all purchased for them by Dylan Klebold s girlfriend, 18-year-old Columbine student Robyn Anderson, who accompanied the two 17-year-olds to the Tanner Gun Show outside Denver, shopping with their cash. She was what is called a straw purchaser, but it would not have been necessary, since youths were allowed to buy rifles and shotguns in Colorado and no background checks are necessary when guns are sold by individuals rather than federally-licensed gun dealers. President Obama is currently proposing laws that would crack down on that type of easy access.Grisham s logic is very flawed. His idea is that if a person is in possession of a gun, then that person is likely to be safer in an unsafe situation. However,  a gun is more likely to discharge accidentally in the home or be used by a family member against another family member rather than against an intruder. The reality is that the more guns are around, the more likely the gun will not be used  for self-defense against a criminal.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQKpAmC3ASk]Feature Image Via YouTube",News,"January 4, 2016",2846
 WATCH: Chuck Schumer CRUSHES Trump’s Tweeting In Fiery Speech That He Will HATE,"Trump s team is working very hard to accommodate the Narcissist in Chief on everything, up to and including how he will, or won t, be more responsible with his tweeting. Sean Spicer, Trump s pick for White House press secretary, actually championed Trump s approach to disseminating information via Twitter by calling it a  direct pipeline to the American people.  Spicer also played up the  results  Trump gets when he tweets.Not everyone likes or appreciates this, and Trump has proven that his use of Twitter, now that he s actually been elected, is dangerous in several ways. Senator Chuck Schumer, the incoming Senate Minority Leader, absolutely destroyed Trump in a speech about it today: So, Mr. President, the issues facing this country are many  These issues are too important for mere words. Our challenge is too entrenched for mere tweeting. Making America great again requires more than 140 characters per issue. With all due respect, America cannot afford a Twitter presidency. We have real challenges and we have real needs to get things done. And many Americans are afraid, Mr. President-elect, that instead of rolling up your sleeves and forging serious policies, for you, Twitter suffices. In other words, Schumer just said what we re all thinking: Trump needs to buckle down instead of playing around on social media while avoiding real work. The presidency is a serious job and requires a serious head.To deal with the issues that Schumer lists in his speech creating jobs, raising incomes, making college and healthcare affordable, rebuilding our infrastructure, making trade laws work for American workers, keeping Americans safe from violence and terrorism, and taking care of our vets Trump actually has to work. He can t fuck around while everyone else tries to do his job for him. That s something he doesn t seem to get.Trump won t like any of this   especially since he recently said he likes Schumer more than many Congressional Republicans. Trump no doubt expects return favors for daring to say that.Trump uses Twitter to brag about things he s done, and also about things he hasn t done. He also uses it to blast individual companies for not doing exactly what he wants, when he wants, and sends their stocks tumbling. One of these days, those tumbles won t be temporary and he ll actually bankrupt someone with a single tweet.And that s assuming he doesn t get us into a nuclear war via his damned Twitter account. Schumer is right. We can t afford a Twitter presidency. We can t afford a president who does nothing and claims credit for every good thing that happens via Twitter.

UPDATE: CRUZ COMMENTS On His Desperate Vote Shaming In Iowa,"UPDATE:Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is defending a campaign mailer that Iowa s secretary of state says misrepresents election law.The mailer bills itself as a  voting violation  notice and tells the recipient it s been sent due to  low expected voter turnout in your area.  It then grades the recipient s voting history and that of several neighbors, citing public records.Cruz told reporters in Sioux City, Iowa, on Saturday that the mailing is  routine. He says he won t apologize for  using every tool we can  to encourage Iowa residents to vote.Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate says in a statement that there s  no such thing  as an election violation related to voting frequency and that insinuating otherwise is  not in keeping in the spirit of the Iowa Caucuses. How is it that Ted Cruz is opposed to gov t data collection yet he s using  big data  mining to shame voters in IOWA into voting for him. Strange, very strange.Residents have been receiving notices like this one:THE COPY AT THE BOTTOM READS: You are receiving this election notice because of low expected voter turnout in your area. Your individual voting history as well as your neighbors  are public record. Their scores are published below, and many of them will see your score as well. CAUCUS ON MONDAY TO IMPROVE YOUR SCORE and please encourage your neighbors to caucus as well. A follow-up notice may be issued following Monday s caucuses . Cruz, a critic of excessive government data collection, has been notably aggressive about gathering personal information for his campaign. Some of the data comes from typical sources, such as voters  consumer habits and Facebook posts. According to several sources, a donor-funded US startup embedded in Republican s campaign has been paying UK university academics to collect psychological profiles on potential voters. The result is a personalized citation sent to Iowan voters from the Cruz campaign.On Friday evening, personalized letters target individual Iowa voters and identifies them as having failed to vote in prior elections. Much like the China  social credit  system, it knows too much about its citizens, and it identifies the neighbors of the voter, and provides their voting history and their score as well.Ted Cruz claims to be running a positive campaign and paints himself as a trustworthy conservative. Attempting to shame voters into caucusing for him with these completely fake  Voting Violation  letters is a sleazy tactic that is sure to leave a bad taste in the mouth of undecided voters. Worse still was his decision to go ahead with sending these letters not thinking he would get caught. In the social media age, when you do something bad, people are bound to find out and expose you. This was clearly a last ditch desperation tactic from a campaign that has been going in the wrong direction in the polls for weeks now.Via: Red State Watcher",politics,"Jan 30, 2016",2880
 Republicans To Give MASSIVE Tax Cuts To The Wealthy While Taking Healthcare From Millions,"Republicans don t care about the American people and this is proof.One of the first actions Republicans intend to take when Donald Trump takes office in January is to repeal Obamacare, which would strip millions of Americans of their health insurance. It would return America to a time when insurance companies could deny people coverage because of pre-existing conditions, which would hurt women most since insurance companies consider being female a pre-existing condition. It would also reverse the ability of children to remain on their parents  insurance until the age of 26 and give insurance companies the power to raise costs like never before.Millions of Americans across the nation, especially those in red states would lose their healthcare coverage, causing the uninsured rate to skyrocket back to historic levels.Repeal would punish Americans simply for getting access to healthcare coverage.But repeal would be a windfall for the wealthy.That s right. Republicans are going to take healthcare away from Americans and give the rich a massive tax cut at the same time.According to Talking Points Memo,Two taxes that will be presumably axed with the law affect only those making $200,000 or more. The break the ACA repeal will bring to those taxpayers will amount to a $346 billion tax cut in total over 10 years, according to the CBO report on the 2015 repeal legislation GOP lawmakers say they ll be using as their model next year.These taxes help cover the subsidies many Americans received in order to help them afford a healthcare plan. But if Obamacare is repealed, those subsidies will be eliminated and will serve as a tax hike on the poor and middle class.This is how Republicans are going to begin 2017. They are literally going to prevent Americans from affording healthcare while giving even MORE money to greedy people who don t need it.On top of all this, Republicans are aiming to phase out Medicare by privatizing it and turning it into a worthless voucher system and have introduced legislation to slash Social Security.In short, Republicans are planning to break the back of the middle class and screw over the working class once and for all. The lives of every American who is not wealthy are about to become a living hell.Featured Image: Image of Paul Ryan by Joe Raedle/Getty Images.

 Trump Says Blacks Are In Worse Shape Than During SLAVERY (VIDEO),"Donald Trump has again made a huge mistake while referring to life experienced by many black Americans every day. The screw-up in question came as Trump seriously argued that the lives of blacks today are worse than they were during slavery and in the Jim Crow segregation era.Speaking at a rally in Kenansville, North Carolina, Trump again stumbled in an apparent attempt to endear himself to black voters. We re going to make our country safe again. We re going to rebuild our inner cities because our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape that they ve ever been in before,  he said.  Ever, ever, ever. The comment, made in a city named for a slave owner, is objectively untrue, and completely ignores that black people were once subjected to slavery and Jim Crow laws.While the media has largely viewed Trump s weird racial comments as a sign that he is  reaching out  to black voters, polls have actually shown that he is poised to do worse with that group than Mitt Romney or John McCain.Black voters have had an inherent distrust of Trump, which has been amplified thanks to his promotion of the racist  birther  conspiracy there for years.Trump also called for the death penalty for the Central Park 5, long after it had been proven that the young black men involved with the case had been proven innocent.Lately, Trump has argued that the black community in America is a desperate, infantile mess, relying on government welfare in order to simply get by. The image Trump has been spreading has not been for black audiences, but instead have been targeted to a conservative base, high on the idea that ethnic minorities always have their hands out.Black voters have found Trump s description of them insulting, particularly coming as the community has made huge strides forward.Featured image via screen capture",News,"September 21, 2016",1843

UNIV Of GA PROFESSOR Allows Students To CHOOSE THEIR OWN GRADES To Help Alleviate Stress,"A University of Georgia professor has adopted a  stress reduction policy  that will allow students to select their own grades if they  feel unduly stressed  by the ones they earned.According to online course syllabi for two of Dr. Richard Watson s fall business courses, he has introduced the policy because  emotional reactions to stressful situations can have profound consequences for all involved. As such, if students feel  unduly stressed by a grade for any assessable material or the overall course,  they can  email the instructor indicating what grade [they] think is appropriate, and it will be so changed  with  no explanation  being required. If in a group meeting, you feel stressed by your group s dynamics, you should leave the meeting immediately and need offer no explanation to the group members,  the policy adds, saying such students can  discontinue all further group work  with their remaining grade being  based totally on non-group work. Similarly, when it comes to  tests and exams  for Watson s  Data Management  and  Energy Informatics  courses, all will be  open book and open notes  and  designed to assess low level mastery of the course material  (the  Stress Reduction  section has been removed from both syllabi, but an archived version of the  Data Management  syllabus has been provided here).Finally, for in-class presentations, Watson will allow  only positive comments  to be made, while  comments designed to improve future presentations will be communicated by email.   For entire story: Campus ReformPerhaps someone should give the good professor a ticket to Afghanistan so he can spend time with some of our young, brave, college-age troops who don t get to chose their next assignment because it might be  too stressful  for them.Parents of these students need to start speaking up.

This means that very capital-intensive, highly leveraged employers, like coal-mining companies, will be forced out of business, with tragic consequences for our families and for many regions of our country,  Murray said. We won t have enough cash flow to exist. It wipes us out,  Murray told CNNMoney in an interview on Tuesday.

To add insult to injury, Chicago s murder rate is sky high with no end in sight but, but, but the illegals have a new  fancy  ID to give them the same benefits as everyone else in the city at a cost of millions to taxpayers. The card is free to the freeloaders while the taxpayers foot the bill The name  municipal ID  was initially floated for the program, but Emanuel revealed that Chicago s city IDs would actually be called  City Keys. He said City Keys were designed to give a person who doesn t have an ID or a driver s license essentially the same benefits as those who do.  When somebody says,  Can I see your driver s license?    what that unlocks and what that smooths out and all the speed bumps that literally get eliminated because you have a driver s license,  Emanuel said.The mayor says the IDs will also provide benefits including discounts at cultural centers, on public transit and for veterans and senior citizens at locations across the city. Chicagoans will be able to link their public transit and library card to the ID and potentially even open bank accounts with it.Critics of the program say it might be a way for undocumented workers or people illegally in the U.S. to obtain a valid ID.GREAT POINT!Read more: Fox News ",politics,"Dec 16, 2017",1424

 Trump Goes COMPLETELY Off The Rails Over Hillary’s Emails And Takes All His Followers With Him,"The right wing is still harping on the FBI s discovery of new emails that supposedly relate to the probe into Hillary Clinton. As expected, Trump has seized on this news as an opportunity to continue trying to smear her all over the pavement. This time, though, his statements about her emails go totally off into the ether: Can you imagine Anthony Weiner has probably every classified email ever sent? Probably studied every single one in between using his machine for other purposes.Including some brand new emails not previously turned over to authorities. Likely including some very, very classified information. Because he totally knows what s going on better than anyone else. But he s probably getting desperate   RealClearPolitics has Hillary ahead in most major polls despite this latest piece of a non-scandal that Republicans keep trying to use to crush her.It s still not yet clear what the FBI is seeing in these emails, so Trump s conclusions are even more questionable. However, of the 650,000 emails found, it s likely that only a small number might be relevant to the original investigation. Also, investigators would still have to find evidence that she knowingly broke the law, because Comey previously decided not to charge her.Earlier, Trump claimed that these emails were worse than Watergate, and one of the prosecutors for Watergate promptly destroyed him for that.  There is no evidence of any violation of law,  he said.  For Trump to reach that conclusion based on a total lack of evidence is reminiscent of the innuendo spread by Joseph McCarthy in the early 1950s. For Trump to continue firing up his loyal subjects by claiming that Anthony Weiner must have closely studied all these emails is just as bad, because he s still not presenting evidence. Just ridiculous suspicions. He hears the word  emails  in association with Hillary, and he jumps on it like a fly to feces because that s all he knows how to do.His supporters chanted,  Lock her up!  as they usually do, while the FBI remains busy tearing itself apart over this. Trump will say anything to get elected, no matter how far-fetched, ridiculous, and just plain stupid it is.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"November 5, 2016",2214

So everything you re learning about this, you re learning from us. After Cuomo s fatal misstep, he quickly began back-pedaling and obfuscating his troubling position regarding public access to items that are in the public interest:What is even more disturbing about Cuomo s off-hand legal declarations here, is that he is doing so in defense of Hillary Clinton s presidential run   whose numerous scandals are pervasive throughout the Wikileaks emails.

NEWSFLASH FOR CNN: If the leaked documents are about elected and appointed public officials (especially those seeking the presidency), and the content exposes illegal and unethical activities   and is clearly in the public interest (which these emails are)   then any decent journalist worth their salt (no such thing at CNN) would publish them and even encourage the public to comb over the documents, unless the media outlet in question functions as a gatekeeper (which CNN does). SEE ALSO: Congressman Jim Jordan stops CNN gatekeeper Chris Cuomo on Benghazi cover-upAs the son of former New York governor Mario Cuomo, and the brother of New York governor Andrew Cuomo, Chris is part of a political dynasty family and member of an elite establishment. It s doubtful he would ve been given such a prominent position in a major broadcast network if he wasn t part of that establishment.Last year, 21WIRE ran a scathing report criticizing CNN s Cuomo over his reliance on dubious ISIS and al Qaeda  online magazines  for his news  breaking news  reports.

It is well documented that the CIA has a number of media infiltration and propaganda programs, including Operation Mockingbird.Is Cuomo participating in such a program, in this case, being run out of CNN?*** SEE ALSO: CNN s New  Source  is ISIS Magazine   Claims a  Schweppes Bomb  Brought Down Russian AirlinerREAD MORE WIKILEAKS NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Wikileaks Files ",Middle-east,"October 20, 2016",3041
LOL! DEM Senator Dick Durbin Voted To Confirm Circuit Judge Gorsuch In 2006…Tells CNN Host “He Can’t Remember” How He Voted [VIDEO],"Sen. Dick Durbin (D., Ill.) announced Tuesday that he will join fellow Democrats in filibustering Neil Gorsuch s nomination to the Supreme Court, despite in 2006 supporting Gorsuch to become a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit.Durbin, the Senate s second-ranking Democrat, took to the Senate floor on Tuesday to voice his opposition to Gorsuch s nomination. He did not earn my vote,  Durbin reportedly said.  I ll vote no when his nomination comes before the committee next week. I will vote no on cloture, and I ll oppose his nomination on the Senate on the Senate floor. At least 21 other Senate Democrats have pledged to vote against Gorsuch as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) rallies support to filibuster the judge s nomination.Gorsuch, President Donald Trump s nominee to the high court, spent last week going through severals hours of testimony during his confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee as they asked him questions about previous rulings and his judicial philosophy.Durbin, a member of the Judiciary Committee, appeared to be impressed by Gorsuch s performance, calling the judge  very gifted  last week.Watch Senator Durbin explain how Democrats are dumbfounded after not being able to pin anything on Judge Gorsuch during his lengthy hearings. Durbin appears to be flabbergasted by the idea that Judge Gorsuch would actually rely on our US Constitution to make decisions as a possible future Supreme Court Justice.Durbin also previously voted to confirm Gorsuch to be a federal Circuit Court judge. The Illinois Democrat appeared on MSNBC s  Morning Joe  last month, when he was asked by co-host Willie Geist whether he supported Gorsuch in 2006. Do I have it right that you voted  aye  on the voice vote in 2006 when Gorsuch was up for the federal appeals court,  Geist asked. Good question, Willie. I just don t remember, to be honest with you,  Durbin responded.  On voice votes, you don t make much of a note of it and it s possible I don t believe there was a lot of controversy surrounding it, but let me tell you he s moving from triple-A ball to the big leagues here. Geist cited the congressional record to point out that Durbin did support Gorsuch. The congressional record shows you did vote in favor it was a unanimous vote, but has something changed in your view of Gorsuch since 2006 when you did vote  aye  for him?  Geist asked No,  Durbin said.Not a single Senate Democrat voiced an objection to Gorsuch in 2006, when then-President George W. Bush nominated him to the Colorado-based 10th Circuit Court of Appeals.For entire story: WFB ",politics,"Mar 29, 2017",2629
 Racists Are THRILLED With Trump’s New Campaign Boss,"The new head of Donald Trump s presidential campaign is already getting rave reviews from a core block of the right-wing coalition that hopes to propel him to the White House: racists.Steve Bannon, who runs the right-wing website Breitbart, is getting cheered on by the so-called  alt right,  the coalition of white power advocates who have come out of the woodwork to support Trump.White nationalists today invest a lot of energy worrying about growing Hispanic and Muslim populations in the U.S. Turns out, Breitbart News spends a lot of time worrying about those things, too. And in Bannon, they see a media-friendly, ethno-nationalist fellow traveler. Latterly, Breitbart emerged as a nationalist site and done great stuff on immigration in particular,  VDARE.com editor Peter Brimelow told The Daily Beast.VDare is a white supremacist site. It s named after Virginia Dare, the first white child born to British colonists in North America. Brimelow said he and Bannon met briefly last month and exchanged pleasantries about each other s work.Richard Spencer, of the white nationalist group National Policy Institute also told the Daily Beast that he was happy to see someone who shares a similar world view elevated to a major position within the Republican Party.Since Bannon has been in charge of Breitbart, since the death of its founder Andrew Breitbart, Breitbart News has been the launching pad for this segment of the right that was once kept much further below the radar within the mainstream conservative movement.His elevation to the head of the Trump campaign is being seen as a triumph of this world view on the right, and Trump s campaign, with its explicit bashing of Latinos and Muslims, appeals strongly to this group.The nominee himself was slow to distance himself from the endorsement of former klansman David Duke, and Trump has often promoted the work of white supremacists who back his campaign on his Twitter account.Featured image via YouTube",News,"August 17, 2016",1970

" Republicans Want A Trump/Gingrich Ticket, Think Six Wives Will Appeal To Women","Apparently, the fact that 70 percent of women view Donald Trump unfavorably is making Republicans think that what he needs is a running mate who also treats women like shit.A top Republican consultant thinks Trump and former disgraced Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich would make the perfect political pair because their six wives combined means they  understand women  better than anyone else. I think Newt is lobbying to be the vice president, and I think their people are paying a lot of attention to him,  Ed Rollins told the National Review on Monday.  It d be a ticket with six former wives, kind of like a Henry VIII thing. They certainly understand women. Wow. Just wow.Republicans are facing an unprecedented opposition from female voters and their solution to fix that is to double down on the whole  let s nominate someone who disrespects women  idea.Donald Trump is on wife number three. And given his history, you can bank on him eventually seeking wife number four when Melania is no longer  a 10  in his eyes.He cheated on his first wife with the woman who became his second wife and was quick to start a relationship with the third Mrs. Trump during the separation.And that relationship history is probably why Trump is so keen to count Gingrich as one of his top allies.Let s not forget that Newt Gingrich also cheated on his first wife with his second wife and callously asked for a divorce while she was recovering from cancer surgery in the hospital. Then he cheated on his second wife with the woman who would become his current wife. In 1993, Gingrich began an affair with House of Representatives staffer Callista Bisek and divorced his second wife after she refused to grant him the open marriage he wanted. Keep in mind, this hypocrisy unfolded as Gingrich and Republicans sought to impeach President Bill Clinton for his affair with Monica Lewinsky.And so, Trump has included Gingrich on his short list of vice-presidential candidates and some Republicans are thrilled because they think their six marriages make them experts when it comes to women and that they ll somehow be able to make women flock to their campaign.Frankly, it s insulting.If Republicans really think this is their best strategy to persuade women to vote for the GOP in November they truly never understood women at all. Just the idea that being like Henry VIII, who had two of his wives executed, would make them somehow more appealing to women demonstrates perfectly just how terribly Republicans have treated women. They literally think emulating a womanizing 16th century English king is the best way to deal with women in the 21st century. If anything can make MORE women hate Trump and the GOP, this is it.Featured Image: Wikimedia ",News,"May 23, 2016",2736
 Missouri GOP Throws Away $8.3 Million To Block Planned Parenthood From Getting $400K,"In a growing trend to keep backwards-thinking idiots voting on the issues that really matter, like a woman s right not just to choose but her right to accessible, affordable healthcare, the GOP is going to even more ridiculous lengths than ever to enshrine their antiquated beliefs into law. Between that and teaching your children to love God and worship him like the founders intended and making sure what happens in your personal life is regulated by overwhelmingly Christian beliefs, the zealots of the right have their hands full. To prove they can be bought with taxpayer money, Missouri Republicans are willing to spend $8.3 million so Planned Parenthood doesn t get $400K.It s so simple it s stupid, which is why it s the perfect play for the GOP. First, you decline all federal funding for healthcare costs associated with women s health care, which in this case is $8.3 million. You then take that money, less the cut intended for Planned Parenthood and anyone else who performs abortions and pay it out of the state s general fund. Go ahead and tack it on the deficit. You can call it the cost of saving lives you ll complain about having to feed. Considering abortions aren t funded with a single federal dollar unless a life is in imminent danger, this really shouldn t matter, but it does.Missouri is spending $8.3 million to block Planned Parenthood from receiving about $400k in federal funds https://t.co/e1drx0WFRH  Reid Wilson (@ConsultReid) April 25, 2016Planned Parenthood and other local women s health clinics that offer abortion also offer pelvic screening, cancer screening, STD screening and family planning services. Every dollar of the $400K cut is taken from those programs because federal dollars can t pay for abortions unless someone s life is at risk. So at great cost to the taxpayer, great cost to the community and without a second thought about how dumb a move this is, Republicans are applauding a victory over that evil Planned Parenthood.In the end, they ve shot themselves in the foot. Healthy, informed women starting at a young age have a huge effect on the teen pregnancy rate, which in turn has a huge effect on the public assistance rolls. Trying to destroy Planned Parenthood over some bogus videos, knowing that the funding you re blocking doesn t cover what you re opposed to and allowing your lie to cost the people $8 million to perpetrate are all signs of desperate people preying on the emotions of pro-lifers. We know them as Republicans.Senator Kurt Schaefer (R), who heads the state s appropriations committee, said that Planned Parenthood is free to do whatever it wants, but that the taxpayer wasn t going to pay for it anymore. That statement is mostly true if you consider that the taxpayer wasn t paying for it to begin with. The taxpayer will still be paying the health care costs for those women who need it, but it will be coming from state revenue and not federal dollars already allocated that your legislature TURNED DOWN. It s so sad when an idea backfires so bad that there s nothing to do but hold an entire party to blame.Featured image from LifeNews.com",News,"April 26, 2016",3125

The [FBI] has so much information about criminal conduct by her and her staff that there is no way that they walk away from this,  Joseph diGenova, formerly the District of Columbia s U.S. Attorney, told Laura Ingraham in a Tuesday radio interview.  They are going to make a recommendation that people be charged and then Loretta Lynch is going to have the decision of a lifetime. I believe that the evidence that the FBI is compiling will be so compelling that, unless [Lynch] agrees to the charges, there will be a massive revolt inside the FBI, which she will not be able to survive as an attorney general.

"Potential Shift: Trump Warns Israel, ‘New Settlements May Not Help Peace in Middle East’","21st Century Wire says Incredibly, Donald Trump may have just thrown an executive head fake to Bibi Netanyahu.Back in December 2015 during the GOP primary campaign,the Israeli Lobby started getting very interested in Trump after he appeared to blame Israel for not securing a lasting peace agreement with the Palestinians. You could hear a pin drop in the debate hall when Trump opined: I have a real question as to whether or not both sides want to make it,  Trump said, before explaining that his concerns predominantly reside with  one side in particular [Israel]. Months later, and only days before the Republican Party s National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio, Trump abandoned any pretence of  neutrality  on the Israel-Palestine issue, insisting that he was now firmly committed  to supporting Israeli settlement expansion in the illegal occupied territories, as well as not recognizing a Palestinian State.At the time this was music to Netanyahu s ears, and even better for the US-based Israel Lobby who spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year to buy-off US Congressmen and Senators in for for Israel to get everything it wants and desires.And then this happened this week By Abby Phillip and Karen DeYoung Washington PostThe White House on Thursday gently warned Israel that new or expanded settlements in the West Bank  may not be helpful  in achieving a Middle East peace, while insisting it has no  official position on settlement activity. A statement issued by press secretary Sean Spicer said that although the administration does not believe settlements are  an impediment to peace, the construction of new settlements or the expansion of existing settlements beyond their current borders may not be helpful in achieving that goal. The American desire for peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians has remained unchanged for 50 years,  Spicer s statement said, a reference to President Trump s insistence that a return to the Middle East negotiating table is a goal he hopes to achieve.While the statement carefully parsed it words, it marked a step away from what some Trump officials   and the president s designated new ambassador to Israel   have said in favor of settlements. Trump s first foreign call as president was to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and he has been sharply critical of former president Barack Obama, whom he characterized as weak on Israel.The apparent genesis of the statement was a story in Thursday s Jerusalem Post, which quoted an unnamed senior administration official telling Netanyahu s government to stop a spree of housing construction approved since Trump s inauguration, lest it interfere with Trump s plans to work toward a peace plan Continue this story at the Washington PostSEE ALSO: The Genealogy of Trump s U-Turn on PalestineREAD MORE ISRAEL NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Israel FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE   SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",US_News,"February 2, 2017",2919
US Middle Class Still Suffering from Rockefeller-Kissinger Industrial Transfer Scheme to China," Dick Eastman The Truth HoundWhen Henry Kissinger and David Rockefeller met with Zhou Enlai in China in 1973 just after President Richard Nixon had visited China establishing official relations an understanding was reached whereby the U.S. would supply industrial capital and know-how to China.In return Kissinger-connected corporations would gain the monopolistic advantage of low-cost labor production which could outcompete all U.S. domestic industry.The comparative advantage gained was being able to hire Chinese laborers who were ready to work hard at exceedingly low cost with no drugs, no alcohol, a strong work ethic, no unions, no paid benefits and weak environmental standards. And with such a large labor pool, burned out workers could simply be replaced. This gave the Rockefeller/Kissinger corporations a major edge over their domestic U.S. competitors who had to pay relatively high wages, high regulation costs, deal with union strikes and collective bargaining etc.Of course, the American consumer did not see greatly lowered prices commensurate with such greatly lowered labor costs. The $19.99 plastic action-figure toy marketed with a Hollywood movie still cost $19.99 even though it cost $12 to $15 to produce in the U.S. but less than $2.00 per copy to produce in China and transport to America s West Coast container ports for distribution throughout America.The consumer paid pretty much the old prices but the corporations split the monopoly profit with China s Princelings since it did not take much of a lowering of prices to drive high-wage, high-benefit, contracted-labor domestic corporations out of business (not to mention the environmental and workplace safety regulations with which domestic companies were saddled).  Then, Wal-Mart became a near-monopoly retailer that increased and reinforced the widespread selling of these off-shore manufactures.Thus, America s domestic producers were not simply being bested on one or another area of production; they were being bested across the entire spectrum of manufactured goods that American buy. It was anticipated that these domestic firms would fail, and their failure was hastened by the banks maintaining a deflationary domestic economy in the U.S. throughout the post Rockefeller-Kissinger-Zhou buildup of China and the degrading of American domestic manufacturing.Remember, the entire money supply of the U.S. is borrowed that is, the money co-created with a debt of an even bigger amount (principal plus compound interest) that must in due course be returned to the lender. But money in the domestic economy was going to multinational corporations and to China, while also going to taxes to pay on the national debt that resulted [NOTE: Due to U.S. industrial depletion, federal revenue receipts as well as the tax-take of state and local governments, shrunk, resulting in greater government borrowing and therefore greater public debts TRUTH HOUND note].  And of course, compound interest was attached to that debt.Rockefeller and Kissinger were (and to some extent still are) at war with middle-class America with intelligent, self-supporting, self-respecting, ambitious, industrious citizens who always pose the greatest threat in the form of populist politics to the bankers and their Bank-of-England/East-India-Company/Rothschild monetary and trade system, the very system that Rockefeller and Kissinger were representing and expanding when they visited Zhou Enlai.So here we are in 2016 and newly elected President Donald J. Trump says he intends to place a tariff on goods imported from China, while the media decries the tariff proposal as a violation of  long-standing liberal free-trade policies. One more thing in defense of who I believe was a great president and a warning for the new one.Richard Nixon opened China believing in peaceful co-existence and the fact that if given time for a fair comparison of how free-enterprise and representative government functions in contrast to the communist planned economy, that the U.S. model would win out over a system where each receives what the state deems he needs and where work is ordered by the state.But of course Kissinger and Rockefeller instigated the Watergate coup against Nixon a frame-up with John Dean and Kissinger as the real  Deep Throats  by my deductions from public information so that the Rockefeller/Kissinger plans for China s industrialization and America s deindustrialization could proceed unopposed, as it certainly did after Nixon resigned to avoid a constitutional crisis that would hinder the proper working of government.Nixon should have fought them because they were about to take a financial axe to this country as soon as Nixon was gone.  When Nixon was gone, they first robbed the middle-class of their savings with banker Paul Volcker s  QE  (quantitative easing) bond purchases at the New York Federal Reserve branch. Then, when that was accomplished, America s savings-and-loans were cast into crisis (because they had been taking in money short-term at 3% and lending long-term at 6%). This helped force the deregulation of banking to Rockefeller advantage after which Volcker moved to become Federal Reserve Chairman in control of the discount rate. With that lever of power that sets the interest-rate framework of the nation, Volcker inaugurated the tight-money (deflation) policy that has persisted to this day, making it very hard for firms to invest in automation to combat the cost advantage of Chinese subsistence labor.Japan was hit with deflation too   they were going to provide us with the robots.  THE WHOLE THING WAS A GREAT PLAN AGAINST US, COORDINATED AT EVERY LEVEL, WITH EVERY INSTITUTION, FROM THE NEWS TALKING ABOUT HOW THE LEVERAGED BUY-OUTS OCCURING IN THE DEFLATION WERE MAKING US  LEAN AND MEAN,  WHEN IN FACT THEY WERE TEARING OUT THE GUTS OF AMERICAN PRODUCTION.  And the news media and the economics and business administration courses in colleges sung the praises of international free trade and the  efficiency of markets  nonstop.I watched it all from a pretty good seat on the sidelines, but of course I was marginalized as just another excess white person who needed to stand aside so that blacks and women could have their fair chance.  And who could argue with that?  So I took to the internet to see what effect I could have simply speaking as a citizen, where I ve met encountered considerable abuse and ridicule, which certainly makes it unpleasant to try and be the  Paul Revere  awakening the good citizens.I do wish President Donald Trump the best. But let us make sure that none of the neo-conservatives he is taking into his administration are really  Kissingers  beholden to Goldman-Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein.

BUSTED! MEDIA Caught Red-Handed Trying To Demoralize Trump Supporters With Phony Polls,"In their desire to push Hillary Clinton across the finish line, the mainstream media and RINO pundits continue to ignore that one little important factoid; like the massive turnout for Trump in almost every state during the primaries. They also intentionally ignore the parallels between Ronald Reagan and Donald J. Trump going into the general election. Most Americans however, are unaware of the tricks our media plays so it s up to us to make sure we share these facts and inform friends, family, neighbors and co-workers about the truth. A new Reuters poll has many Republicans worried about the outcome of the 2016 presidential race and many on the Democratic side ready to pop the champaign corks.The poll shows presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton leading by a shocking 14 percent over her Republican rival Donald Trump: 47 percent to 33 percent.Unfortunately there s one problem with the poll. It is heavily skewed.The Gateway Pundit reports that of Reuters  1,201 respondents, 626 were Democrats and only 423 were Republicans.In other words, 52 percent of Reuter s respondents were Democrats and only 35 percent were Republican a huge 33% advantage for Democrats!According to AllenBWest.com, Reuters isn t the only misleading presidential poll. A new ABC News/ Washington Post survey found voters preferred Hillary 51 percent to 39 percent. In that sample, 36 percent of respondents were Democrats and only 24 percent were Republicans.The skewed polls are made less believable by the fact that Republican turnout in 2016 is likely to be higher than in previous years. As NPR noted in March, Republicans far outstripped Democrats in primary turnout, due in part to the insurgent nature of the Donald Trump candidacy.  Hannity.comIt s not just the leftist media who is beating the drum of doom for Trump, while (falsely) pushing the narrative that he can t beat Crooked Hillary in the general election.  FLASHBACK: You hear the establishment types talk about it nearly every day on the FOX News Channel.For his part, Donald Trump says he has not  even started  on Hillary Clinton.The elites also worried about Ronald Reagan s chances back in March 1980. Ronald Reagan was down 15 points in the polls in March. Here is the map showing how many states he won in the general election compared to Jimmy Carter who was polling at 15 points ahead of Trump:The CSMonitor reported, via Free Republic:The nation s Republicans are working against the clock to answer two key questions: Can conservative Ronald Reagan possibly attract enough independent and Democratic votes to win in November?An if he is likely to lose, has former President Gerald Ford time enough to challenge him for the GOP nomination?The consensus among political experts is that time has probably already run out for Gerald Ford, though he still appears the stronger choice to beat Jimmy Carter in November.But some experts caution: Don t count Ronald Reagan out as a national candidate for the fall. He is not, they say,  a McGovern or a Goldwater    fringe candidates who led their parties to one-sided defeats in 1972 and 1964. Intellectuals don t want to take him seriously, but he does well with working-class voters. He would take the West, challenge President Carter in the South, and do well in the pivotal Midwest states like Ohio and Illinois, whose southern regions titled toward Carter in 1976, they say.Back in March 1980 the establishment the establishment said the same thing about Ronald Reagan.They said he could never defeat Jimmy Carter.He was too divisive.  Gateway PunditHere are a few inconvenient facts you won t see in the mainstream media:The Republican Party started the year with 17 bona fide candidates for President. This was more candidates than any major party in history.Trump has more wins than any other Republican or Democrat candidate in this year s race with 36. He also has more primary wins with 33 and leads all candidates in percent of overall wins and in percent of primary wins.Trump surpassed the number of delegates needed to win the Republican nomination for President a couple weeks ago.This may be more delegates than any other Republican candidate and a higher percentage of delegates than any Republican or Democrat candidate in the race.Trump received 13,406,108 votes to date in the elections according to www.thegreenpapers.com.As a result Trump has more votes than any candidate in Republican history.Trump shattered the previous record by 1.4 million votes   and that was with 17 candidates in the raceGeorge W. Bush had 12 million votes in 2000. The Republican Party also set a party record this year in pre-convention state election turnout with over 28 million votes to date which is 139% of the record high voter turnout in 2008. This increase in votes can be attributed to Donald Trump.Via: Gateway Pundit ",left-news,"Jun 29, 2016",4846
 Trump National Security Pick Monica Crowley’s Book No Longer For Sale Over Plagiarism,"Conservative columnist Monica Crowley is set for a top role in Donald Trump s administration and it s just been revealed that she plagiarized a massive portion of her 2012 book, stealing from journalists, notable Republicans and even from Wikipedia. Who plagiarizes from Wikipedia, by the way? She even plagiarized from a statement made by Dick Cheney. Crowley plagiarized more than 50 times in her book  What the (Bleep) Just Happened,  according to an analysis. She literally had to plagiarize in order to be critical of President Obama in her book.We re pretty sure Crowley didn t plagiarize her tweet last year when she wrote,  I guess Putin is going to have to do it. RT  State Dept Won t Release Clinton Fdn Emails for 27 Months. Crowley was picked by the president-elect to serve as senior director of strategic communications for the National Security Council.On Tuesday, publisher HarperCollins said that it will stop selling Crowley s book after the investigation revealed the massive amount of plagiarism in it. The book, which has reached the end of its natural sales cycle, will no longer be offered for purchase until such time as the author has the opportunity to source and revise the material,  HarperCollins said.CNN Money reports:A request for comment from the Trump transition team was not immediately returned. A spokesperson for the Trump transition team told CNN s KFile Saturday when the initial report was published that they were standing by Crowley. HarperCollins one of the largest and most respected publishers in the world published her book which has become a national best-seller. Any attempt to discredit Monica is nothing more than a politically motivated attack that seeks to distract from the real issues facing this country,  the spokesperson said.It s not just her book. Yesterday, it was revealed that Crowley also  lifted, with little to no changes, from other scholarly works without proper attribution  in her PhD dissertation at Columbia University and the evidence is overwhelming.Last year, the right wing pundit tweeted out a picture suggesting that the existence of the Berlin Wall was a good thing.

“MY HOMETOWN IS GONE” A Shocking First-Hand Account of the Islamization of an American Small Town,"Did you know that over 15 thousand so-called Muslim  refugees  have been admitted to the US since inauguration day?WHERE DID THEY GO? 15,726 Mostly Muslim Refugees Admitted Since Inauguration DayAmericans have got to wake up and see what s happening to us!Loretta Brady has written the best ever first-hand account of the damage the refugee resettlement program is doing to America s small towns. It s truly a must-read! Please share!I gave a talk at a luncheon a few months ago that was basically relating my story of how my hometown has been Islamized by refugee resettlement. So it makes sense to do a blog post.I m from the Utica, NY area. Utica is the city nicknamed by the UN  the city that loves refugees!  Soon every American city will be a city that loves refugees! Get ready! So I would like to tell you what it is like living in an area where the major city is about 25% (or more) refugee, mainly MuslimI was born in Utica, a  faded industrial town  along the Mohawk River/Erie Canal corridor, and lived there until I was 8-years-old when my family moved to a nearby small college town. I loved living in Utica because there were lots of families on my block, big Catholic families with lots of kids. You could yard-hop, checking out who was available for play. You could bike around the neighborhood. There were block parties in the summer. My grandmother lived up the street. Life was good.My father and his father were born and lived in Utica, NY. My father was a judge in Utica, like his father before him. The Catholic school my father attended is now a community center for refugees. After I moved back to the Utica area as an adult I used to recite  Full fathom five  to the children as we drove by my father s former Catholic school. (Nothing of him that doth fade,/But doth suffer a sea change/Into something rich and strange.)When I had my first child I was living in New York City. Her father and I divorced when she was a baby, and when she was two-years-old, I beat a hasty retreat back home to Upstate NY. There I met my husband. We got married, we had babies (in that order, ahem), and we settled down outside of Utica.When I moved back home one of the first things I noticed was that an old Methodist church was being converted into a bright shiny white new mosque. The local paper touted this as immense progress and featured a local woman who had attended the church as a child and was positively brimming with joy it was being turned into a mosque. If that is the general sentiment, then it s odd that my county went for Trump, right? There are at least two mosques in the city now. They just built another.Where do I start? Utica had always been  the city that loves refugees  but under Obama things accelerated. Muslim immigrants were suddenly in these local bureaucratic positions where they had power over you. This, in what is probably one of the most corrupt states in the union, where the power of the state is everything.The social worker at my daughter s school was a Muslim immigrant. I looked for her profile on the school website, I googled her, I could not find information on her background, resume, qualifications, or educational attainments.When I began to homeschool my daughter the administrator to whom I had to submit paperwork was a Muslim immigrant. To homeschool in New York State you must submit detailed quarterly reports to an administrator at your local school district. I googled the administrator. He also worked at the local Board of Cooperative Educational Services, but I could not find any other information on his background, resume, qualifications, or educational attainments.I was friends with the wife of the Orthodox priest at our church, and she told me that this administrator found some problems with her paperwork and challenged her. It turned out she was right about the issue, and he backed down. Comfy little situation, right?Right before we moved I went to the ER. The nurse practitioner was a Muslim immigrant (Bosnia), and the doctor she worked under was a Muslim immigrant (Pakistan). I remember how during the visit I suddenly became very aware of the cross I always wear around my neck.In 2012 on the way home from my daughter s piano lesson, I left my children in the car, ran into the supermarket for ten minutes, and came out to find a man outside my car who informed me he had called the police. I called my husband and my parents and together we waited for the police officer who eventually arrived and arrested me. Lenore Skenazy wrote an account of the incident in the Wall Street Journal. It is pretty accurate except that it wasn t a suburb, it was a village of less than 2,000 people.It was a terrible thing to do, but it was not hot (we re about two hours from the Canadian border), it was the small safe village where I grew up (I think I was the only arrest that week), and I spent half my childhood hanging out in the car with my brother while my mother did errands. My friend sent me a Salon article (I don t read Salon) about a mom who did the same thing, and she like me was in her hometown where she grew up, and so automatically just living by the rules she grew up with. My mother never got arrested. It didn t occur to me I would be arrested. That s my only arrest. So far. But anyway, the point of this story is I was then investigated (and cleared which I hope should be obvious) by CPS.The CPS worker who investigated me was Muslim.So let me just summarize: the social worker at the school is Muslim, the administrator who ok s homeschooling is Muslim, the CPS worker is Muslim, the nurse practitioner at the ER is Muslim, the doctor at the ER is Muslim. These are positions of authority that wield a lot of power.Are you starting to get the picture?The spring before we moved Utica made national news because of a federal grant to the local community college (two million dollars) for a (Muslim immigrant) professor to teach teenage (Muslim) refugees how to build drones. The grant didn t mention explicitly that the drones would be equipped with bombs or anything, so it was all aboveboard. This was going on like down the road from us. My husband assured me he could shoot any drone out of the sky, and I m sure he could, but curiously enough that didn t assuage my anxiety, but only exacerbated it. The last thing I needed was my husband getting arrested on federal charges for taking down a drone.I looked up the Muslim immigrant professor on Linked In. It was an odd career trajectory. It looked like he had been a soccer coach a few years before. It wasn t exactly clear to me how he had landed his present job where he was getting federal money to train Muslims to build drones, but, hey, that s the Obama era for you.In 2015, a 26-year-old Bosnian refugee in Utica was arrested for supporting ISIS. The local paper reported that in his spare time when he wasn t supporting ISIS, he enjoyed mixed martial arts fighting at the local gym. Local law enforcement complained they hadn t been informed of the investigation. You know and I know that if anything happens, local law enforcement are the first responders.I went to a couple Trump rallies and meetings in Upstate NY before we moved. When I mentioned the arrest of this ISIS supporter to a local businessman at one of the meetings, he got a very serious look and said Utica was full of ISIS and the local police were really worried. The Trump meetings were emotional. The organizer picked a donut shop whose owner was friendly to the Trump platform so we could talk. Everyone went around the table and introduced themselves. Two of the women cried. New York State is not doing well.Don t believe the Start-Up NY commercials. Potemkin Village.My husband lost two jobs in three years in Upstate NY. Not by any fault of his own- he is a very skilled, dedicated, experienced, hard worker- but because his bosses went out of business. His first boss moved to North Carolina. His second boss had to close up shop, which seemed linked to a downturn in the stock market. A lot of the middle class in Upstate NY are boomer retirees, and when the stock market goes down, they get nervous and cut back on renovation and building. My husband is a carpenter.The Upstate New York economy is one of the worst in the country. That s why it s a good place to resettle refugees.After the second time my husband lost his job, I applied for food stamps for the family. When I moved back home I had tried to find a job as a lawyer, I could not. I finally found a job processing letters of credit for an investment bank. My salary was $27,000 a year. I actually got paid an extra $2,000 higher than starting salary for my translation skills. After I had my second child, most of my pay after taxes would have gone to childcare. The New York State tax system penalizes low-income people who work. So I stayed home. My parents helped us with bills.So my husband was unemployed, I was unemployed, we have four children, we certainly qualified for food stamps, and I felt stupid and irresponsible for not applying when we qualified for them, so I applied. The local Department of Social Services does not answer their phone. You can go there and wait in line. It is a very very long line, and a very uncomfortable place to be. By tacit agreement, the white people stick together in the waiting area. The Department of Social Services rejected my application several times without reason. I knew we qualified, so it became for me this bureaucratic challenge that I had to vanquish. It took a lot of wrangling and some certified sign-for-delivery mailings which were expensive. I managed to get us a month of food stamps. It was about $50 a week, I think, for a family of six. I don t know if that s average or not.Want to know why my application was rejected several times even though we qualified? Want to know why it was so difficult to get food stamps? The Department of Social Services in my area is swamped because of the refugees. 25% of the city are refugees. Virtually all of the refugees are on welfare. And when they apply for welfare, they don t do so as an independent entity, as I did. They go through their refugee resettlement agency who deals with the Department of Social Services for them. So basically Americans get the short shrift, and refugees get taken care of. And that s America. This is why so many Democrats voted for Trump. Americans are getting squeezed out by non-Americans at multiple levels.What else to tell you?New York State sued our local school districhttps://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/18/nyregion/new-york-state-accuses-utica-school-district-of-bias-against-refugees.html?_r=1t for trying to separate teenage refugees from the rest of the students. I went to a CLE where I sat next to a lawyer for the school district, and she was freaking out over this lawsuit. She was like, The state is coming after us, and we don t have any money. My county is a Democrat county, and Trump won my county. Issues like this are why. Americans can see that they are being forced to accommodate non-Americans to their own detriment and expense.There is TB in Utica. I m sure there is more than reported. Obama stopped screening foreigners for TB, which America has been doing since before the days of Ellis Island, and the refugees are from places where TB is endemic. Whenever I was in a hospital- when I gave birth or when I went to the ER- I would be very aware of my surroundings.The local Walmart is full of headscarves and burkas. I cried when I went into my first Walmart in North Carolina and all I saw were Americans.The nice lady who asked me to give a talk a couple months ago on my hometown asked me if there were any refugees who were an  asset to the community . I replied that they do not consider themselves part of your community, so if they are going to be an asset to any community, it is not going to be yours.I hope I ve presented an idea of why I m so opposed to refugee resettlement. I couldn t write this blog post where I m from. I d be scared that someone would target my house. I d be scared of the authorities. I had to wait to get to higher ground to speak more openly.North Carolina is like Heaven. People are so much happier here. I thank God every day we got here. I consider it a  free zone , and I want it to stay free.Please also check out my other blog post on Utica, NY. I wrote it after my husband and I drove into the city on a random Sunday and saw about a dozen refugees (all women, and you know there had to be men as well, who just weren t present at the time) moving into renovated housing. This is in an area where low-income Americans, white and black, languish in subpar housing. A lot went on under the Obama Administration. And I doubt a lot of it was on the books.

COLIN POWELL Picked On The Wrong Guy: GENERAL FLYNN Rips Him To Shreds Over Nasty Comments In Leaked Emails [VIDEO],"After General Powell s email server was hacked it seems that Hillary and Trump were not the only ones he attacked with insults and nasty rhetoric.Powell went after retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, a top Trump military adviser. Powell called Flynn  a jerk who is unchained  and a  right-wing nutty.  Powell however had to admit once called on the insults that he has actually never even met Flynn nor did he ever serve with him.He responded by stating,  Talking to people in the know, his real problem was leadership and management issues at DIA. Senior staff was in incipient revolt. He has been over the top in his comments, conduct unbecoming. But he is unchained.  He continues by saying,  Pattern of behavior which is why he was fired. Real question is how he got that far in the Army. Flynn did respond during an interview on the  Kelly File. I ve actually been called worse things by my little sister.  He went on to say,  Colin Powell, he s an amazing guy, amazing service, but he s actually, you know, as a footnote in history, he s going to be always struggling for his credibility because of the statement that he made to the United Nations that brought us into the war in Iraq. After the disparaging remarks towards Hillary, Trump, Flynn and a even a few other service members were highlighted as having been said by Powell, Flynn did caution that prominent individuals need to be more careful about what they send electronically.H/T [ Fox ] ",Government News,"Sep 16, 2016",1452
 Bernie Sanders Supporters Need To Support These Progressive Candidates,"When Senator Bernie Sanders speaks about a political revolution, he means grassroots organization propelling not just him to the presidency, but other progressive candidates into elected office as well. While Hillary Clinton has built upon her lead in the Democratic Primary, Bernie Sanders  supporters should still fight to help progressive candidates across the country on local, state, and federal levels. Many of these candidates represent the issues and concerns Bernie Sanders addressed that makes his candidacy so appealing to thousands of Americans.While his opponents court wealthy campaign contributors, the 6 8 tattooed Fetterman hosts meet and greets in Pennsylvania dive bars to raise small individual campaign contributions. The Harvard University graduate came to Braddock, PA in 2001 to help local youth earn their GEDs. In 2005, he won the election for mayor by a single vote and has helped transform a forgotten remnant of the once prosperous American steel industry into a budding new haven for small businesses, artists, and developers. Pennsylvania holds its Democratic Primary on April 26th. Debbie Wasserman Schultz s public image was significantly damaged as her leadership of the DNC as its chair was highly scrutinized by both Clinton and Sanders supporters, in addition to many of her colleagues. The corruption and poor leadership she has exhibited inspired Wall Street activist, Tim Canova, to become her first Democratic Primary challenger since she first was elected to congress in 2004. The primary will be held on August 30th.Congressman Grayson took a career risk, especially since he is running in a Democratic Primary against a fellow Congressman, Patrick Murphy, to formally endorse Senator Bernie Sanders for president. Grayson is known for his productivity in congress getting bills amendments proposed and passed, but he is also well known for irking Republicans and his fellow Democrats as well. The proud progressive offers an alternative to the moderate Patrick Murphy, who switched to the Democratic Party shortly after contributing to Mitt Romney s failed 2012 presidential bid.On June 7th, Tom Fiegen is running for the Democratic nomination to unseat Republican incumbent U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley. Fiegen, a proponent for campaign finance reform, wants to help the working class people who are all too often his clients as a bankruptcy lawyer in Iowa.A former Nevada Assemblywoman, Flores comes from a family of 13 children, born into a poor family in a low income neighborhood in the Las Vegas area, she turned her life around after a brief stint in juvenile detention, returning to school, and going on to college to become a lawyer, and eventually a state legislator by the age of 31. She maintains a strong lead against her opposition in the Democratic Primary on June 14th.Progressive candidate, Jesse Sbaih faces a tougher road in winning the Democratic nomination for Nevada s 3rd congressional district s seat. The immigrant from Jordan came to the U.S. with his family at the age of 11, and worked his way through school as a dishwasher. Now he runs his own law firm and is running for congress to put many progressive reforms proposed by Senator Bernie Sanders into legislation. Like most pro-Sanders candidates, Sbaih is funding his campaign on small, individual contributions rather than Super-Pac or corporate money.Zephyr Teachout, an Associate Law Professor at Fordham University, took the Democratic establishment by surprise after she won 34 won 34 percent of the vote in the 2014 Democratic Primary against incumbent Democrat, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. This year, she is running for congress and will most likely take the Democratic nomination in the primary on June 28th.Senator Bernie Sanders  campaign has also highlighted progressive superstars already in office. Aside from Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, who made national headlines after resigning for her position as DNC Vice Chair to endorse Sanders, self-proclaimed socialist, Kshamas Sawant, was elected to Seattle s City Council in 2013, and re-elected in 2015 despite opposition from the Democratic Party establishment. Sawant was a key leader in pushing for the passage of a $15 minimum wage in Seattle and has led efforts to combat increasing city wide rents. When you occupy elected office it is absolutely critical you remain unfailingly loyal to the needs of working people which means you can never be bought and every moment you have to use your position to amplify the voice of working people, the voice of people of color, and the voices of the marginalized,  she told the Huffington Post in a December 2015 interview.Featured image via Marc Nozell on Flickr",News,"March 16, 2016",4701

 GOP Columnist Bill Kristol Has The Goods On How Republicans REALLY Feel About Comey’s Testimony,"The entire nation has been glued to the coverage of fired FBI Director James Comey s testimony all day. When it was finally over, pundits continued to pick it apart. Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee claimed victory for Donald Trump in the government s investigation into potential collusion between Team Trump and the Russians. Trump s own lawyer all but called James Comey a liar in a statement whose clear purpose was to discredit the testimony altogether. And perhaps most pathetically of all, House Speaker Paul Ryan tried to excuse Trump s inappropriate  loyalty  requests of Comey as sheer ignorance of how Washington works. All in all, the GOP message is one of  nothing to see here, folks. Despite these bizarre public statements on the part of top Republicans, there is one prominent conservative who is willing to tell the truth about how the GOP is really feeling about the situation regarding Trump and the Russians. In short, they are shitting their pants. Conservative columnist and editor of the Weekly Standard Bill Kristol tweeted: I happen to have seen various GOP Senators this afternoon. Trust me: Basically, they re not just concerned. They re pretty terrified. I happen to have seen various GOP Senators this afternoon. Trust me: Basically, they're not just concerned. They're pretty terrified. https://t.co/WopZ2LiseR  Bill Kristol (@BillKristol) June 8, 2017This tweet comes as a result of an article in Politico that referred to the Republican leadership s interest in what James Comey would be saying on Capitol Hill as a  collective yawn.  Since this wouldn t be the first time the GOP has sold their souls and lied through their teeth to cover for Trump, I am more inclined to believe Bill Kristol. Further, they know they cannot publicly criticize Trump or show any sort of wavering in their confidence in his innocence in this whole Russia mess without having Trump light them up on Twitter and having his fans come for them.So, in other words, this Russia stuff is getting so hot that even Republicans cannot privately deny it any longer. But, they ll never say a word in public against Trump, because they care more about saving their proverbial political asses than they do about this country.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"June 8, 2017",2282
Robert Parry: US Intel Report on ‘Russian Hack’ Still Lacks Proof,"Consortium News Exclusive: Despite mainstream media acceptance, the U.S. intelligence community s assessment on alleged Russian  hacking  still lacks hard public evidence, a case of  trust-us  by politicized spy agencies, writes Robert Parry.By Robert ParryRepeating an accusation over and over again is not evidence that the accused is guilty, no matter how much  confidence  the accuser asserts about the conclusion. Nor is it evidence just to suggest that someone has a motive for doing something. Many conspiracy theories are built on the notion of  cui bono    who benefits   without following up the supposed motive with facts.But that is essentially what the U.S. intelligence community has done regarding the dangerous accusation that Russian President Vladimir Putin orchestrated a covert information campaign to influence the outcome of the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election in favor of Republican Donald Trump.Just a day after Director of National Intelligence James Clapper [image, left] vowed to go to the greatest possible lengths to supply the public with the evidence behind the accusations, his office released a 25-page report that contained no direct evidence that Russia delivered hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton s campaign chairman John Podesta to WikiLeaks.The DNI report amounted to a compendium of reasons to suspect that Russia was the source of the information   built largely on the argument that Russia had a motive for doing so because of its disdain for Democratic nominee Clinton and the potential for friendlier relations with Republican nominee Trump.But the case, as presented, is one-sided and lacks any actual proof. Further, the continued use of the word  assesses    as in the U.S. intelligence community  assesses  that Russia is guilty   suggests that the underlying classified information also may be less than conclusive because, in intelligence-world-speak,  assesses  often means  guesses. The DNI report admits as much, saying,  Judgments are not intended to imply that we have proof that shows something to be a fact. Assessments are based on collected information, which is often incomplete or fragmentary, as well as logic, argumentation, and precedents. But the report s assessment is more than just a reasonable judgment based on a body of incomplete information. It is tendentious in that it only lays out the case for believing in Russia s guilt, not reasons for doubting that guilt.A Risky BetFor instance, while it is true that many Russian officials, including President Putin, considered Clinton to be a threat to worsen the already frayed relationship between the two nuclear superpowers, the report ignores the downside for Russia trying to interfere with the U.S. election campaign and then failing to stop Clinton, which looked like the most likely outcome until Election Night.If Russia had accessed the DNC and Podesta emails and slipped them to WikiLeaks for publication, Putin would have to think that the National Security Agency, with its exceptional ability to track electronic communications around the world, might well have detected the maneuver and would have informed Clinton.So, on top of Clinton s well-known hawkishness, Putin would have risked handing the expected incoming president a personal reason to take revenge on him and his country. Historically, Russia has been very circumspect in such situations, usually holding its intelligence collections for internal purposes only, not sharing them with the public.While it is conceivable that Putin decided to take this extraordinary risk in this case   despite the widely held view that Clinton was a shoo-in to defeat Trump   an objective report would have examined this counter argument for him not doing so.But the DNI report was not driven by a desire to be evenhanded; it is, in effect, a prosecutor s brief, albeit one that lacks any real evidence that the accused is guilty. Further undercutting the credibility of the DNI report is that it includes a seven-page appendix, dating from 2012, that is an argumentative attack on RT, the Russian government-backed television network, which is accused of portraying  the US electoral process as undemocratic. The proof for that accusation includes RT s articles on  voting machine vulnerabilities  although virtually every major U.S. news organizations has run similar stories, including some during the last campaign on the feasibility of Russia hacking into the actual voting process, something that even U.S. intelligence says didn t happen.The reports adds that further undermining Americans  faith in the U.S. democratic process, RT broadcast, hosted and advertised third-party candidate debates.  Apparently, the DNI s point is that showing Americans that there are choices beyond the two big parties is somehow seditious. The RT hosts asserted that the US two-party system does not represent the views of at least one-third of the population and is a  sham,  the report said. Yet, polls have shown that large numbers of Americans would prefer more choices than the usual two candidates and, indeed, most Western democracies have multiple parties, So, the implicit RT criticism of the U.S. political process is certainly not out of the ordinary.The report also takes RT to task for covering the Occupy Wall Street movement and for reporting on the environmental dangers from  fracking,  topics cited as further proof that the Russian government was using RT to weaken U.S. public support for Washington s policies (although, again, these are topics of genuine public interest).Behind the CurtainThough it s impossible for an average U.S. citizen to know precisely what the U.S. intelligence community may have in its secret files, some former NSA officials who are familiar with the agency s eavesdropping capabilities say Washington s lack of certainty suggests that the NSA does not possess such evidence.Binney, in an article co-written with former CIA analyst Ray McGovern, said,  With respect to the alleged interference by Russia and WikiLeaks in the U.S. election, it is a major mystery why U.S. intelligence feels it must rely on  circumstantial evidence,  when it has NSA s vacuum cleaner sucking up hard evidence galore. What we know of NSA s capabilities shows that the email disclosures were from leaking, not hacking. For instance, that s the view of William Binney, who retired as NSA s technical director of world military and geopolitical analysis and who created many of the collection systems still used by NSA.There is also the fact that both WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and one of his associates, former British Ambassador Craig Murray, have denied that the purloined emails came from the Russian government. Going further, Murray has suggested that there were two separate sources, the DNC material coming from a disgruntled Democrat and the Podesta emails coming from possibly a U.S. intelligence source, since the Podesta Group represents Saudi Arabia and other foreign governments Continue this article at Consortium NewsREAD MORE  RUSSIAN HACK  NEWS AT: 21WIRE Russia Files",US_News,"January 8, 2017",7130
 Bill Maher Takes Down Trump’s Lying Chief Of Staff In BLISTERING Rebuke (VIDEO)," White House Chief of Staff John Kelly is a Four Star Marine General who gave his son to this nation. That is why it was such a relief when he joined the Trump White House. Everyone thought he d bring order to a dangerously chaotic situation. However, as Donald Trump s attacks on Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-FL) in the midst of a Gold Star family s grief, General Kelly revealed his true colors. Instead of smoothing things over, he escalated the attacks, and actually lied about Rep. Wilson from the White House press podium. Well, one person isn t having any of this crap: Comedian and host of HBO s Real Time Bill Maher.During a blistering statement on his Friday night panel, Maher said of Kelly: He smeared and lied. He smeared that congresslady and he lied about it. He was supposed to be the Trump-minder, but now he acts like Trump. You can be this guy that everybody says  you are the man of unimpeachable integrity,  or you can take political hit shots and be the hatchet man. You can t do both. Maher is correct. Kelly s integrity is no longer unimpeachable, because he chose to utter provable lies from the White House press podium and has also chosen not to apologize for it. He defended the indefensible with regards to Trump s appalling statements to the Myeshia Johnson, the grieving widow of Army Sergeant La David Johnson. With that, Kelly smeared something that is supposed to be sacred, and he cannot take that back.I never thought I d say this about a man who has given so much to this country   including his own son   but here it is: Shame on you, John Kelly. You ve disgraced your position with what you have done. You should apologize to Sgt. Johnson s widow, and to the nation   and then you should resign.Watch Maher s remarks below:Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"October 21, 2017",1802
"SHOCKING! EVIDENCE SHOWS WHY OBAMA IS HEART OF VIOLENT #BlackLivesMatter COP KILLING, ANTI-WHITE MOVEMENT"," There will be no peace in America until whites begin to hate their whiteness  -Reverend Jeremiah Wright, Barack Hussein Obama s pastor for over 20 yearsWhen the organization known as Black Lives Matter (BLM) was first formed right after George Zimmerman s acquittal in the death of Trayvon Martin on July 13, 2013, most overlooked the true intentions of the group beyond their calls for  justice . Fast forward to today and it can no longer be overlooked that their calls for justice now result in retaliatory violence against those whom they believe are the oppressors, namely those being white people in general and police officers specifically. By tracing the origins of the organization back to its philosophical formation in the 1960 s, we can begin to see how BLM is rooted in the radical ideological beliefs espoused by none other than President Barack Obama.Before we get to that point though, it is crucial for us to understand that BLM was founded by three militant feminists by the name of Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opel Tometi.While each played their part in contributing to the creation of the group, Garza is the driving force as she detailed the philosophy behind BLM in her October 2014 article titled A Herstory of the #BlackLivesMatter Movement. Garza writes the following in regards to BLM s philosophy: Black Lives Matter is a unique contribution that goes beyond extrajudicial killings of Black people by police and vigilantes. It goes beyond the narrow nationalism that can be prevalent within some Black communities, which merely call on Black people to love Black, live Black and buy Black, keeping straight cis Black men in the front of the movement while our sisters, queer and trans and disabled folk take up roles in the background or not at all. Black Lives Matter affirms the lives of Black queer and trans folks, disabled folks, Black-undocumented folks, folks with records, women and all Black lives along the gender spectrum. It centers those that have been marginalized within Black liberation movements. It is a tactic to (re)build the Black liberation movement. The key takeaway from Garza s statement is found in the last two sentences primarily as she notes that BLM was created with the intention to  (re)build the Black liberation movement.  The reason this statement is of utter importance is because it ties directly to the idea of Black Liberation theology, which was the doctrine taught to Obama for over twenty years at his church in Chicago made famous by Obama s pastor, Jeremiah Wright. Black Liberation theology was first formed on July 31, 1966. In an article published by NPR it is noted that: Black liberation theology originated on July 31, 1966, when 51 black pastors bought a full page ad in the New York Times and demanded a more aggressive approach to eradicating racism echo[ing] the demands of the black power movement. What is often overlooked in the formation of the group is the linkage between the Nation of Islam and Black Liberation theology as Wright s mentor and founder of Black Liberation theology James Cone credited Malcolm X with  shaking him out of his theological complacency. Stanley Kurtz of National Review highlighted this synergy in noting that according to Cone,  The black intellectual s goal is to aid in the destruction of America as he knows it.  Such destruction requires both black anger and white guilt. The black-power theologian s goal is to tell the story of American oppression so powerfully and precisely that white men will  tremble, curse, and go mad, because they will be drenched with the filth of their evil , wrote Cone.In an excerpt from Stanley Kurtz s piece drawing on the influence of Malcom X on Black Liberation theology, Kurtz states:So what exactly is  black power ? Echoing Malcolm X, Cone defines it as  complete emancipation of black people from white oppression by whatever means black people deem necessary.  Open, violent rebellion is very much included in  whatever means ; like the radical anti-colonial theorist Frantz Fanon, on whom he sometimes draws, Cone sees violent rebellion as a transformative expression of the humanity of the oppressed Theologically,  Cone affirms,  Malcolm X was not far wrong when he called the white man the devil. The false Christianity of the white-devil oppressor must be replaced. Couple these words to Obama s pastor Jeremiah Wright s statement that  there will be no peace in America until whites begin to hate their whiteness  and you can begin to understand that the rhetoric behind Black Lives Matter that blames  white privilege  for virtually everything is rooted in Black Liberation theology. However Wright was radicalized , notes Bud White of NoQuarterUSA,  it is clear that he consciously appropriated the language and tenor of the Nation of Islam.  White documents the following:Wright s statement that 9/11 was deserved retribution ( We have supported state terrorism against the Palestinians and black South Africans America s chickens are coming home to roost ) is a perfect echo of Malcolm X s statement that  The assassination of Kennedy is a result of that way of life and thinking. The chickens came home to roost.  Although it appears that Wright began his focus on Black Liberation Theology sometime after 1966, his racial attitudes and rhetoric have imitated that of NOI since at least 1970. Wright s blaming the United States for creating AIDS to kill minorities is but just one example of his thinking being in lockstep with NOI.The Nation of Islam and Black Liberation Theology are two doors to the same room.Black Liberation Theology is a  palatable  form of  Christian  black nationalism. The fiery anti-American, race-baiting words of Wright, Cone, and others behind the theology of Black Liberation  are from the same philosophical cauldron as the Nation of Islam , concludes White.From the beliefs that served as Obama s bedrock foundation for his ideology, is it any wonder that today that the radicals behind Black Lives Matter and the Nation of Islam are allowed a free pass to incite as much hatred and retaliation against those they deem are the oppressors? As violence has ramped up in the first half of 2015 in targeted assassinations against police officers, little to no coverage by the media is given to a meeting that was hosted by the White House on December 1st.On December 1, 2014, Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and Attorney General Eric Holder met with seven Black and Latino organizers   from Ferguson, Mo.; Columbus, Ohio; Miami, Florida; and New York City, who had been leading the ongoing actions to disrupt the status quo. In an article posted by the website FergusonAction, it is explained that during this meeting activists such as Ashley Yates were given the platform by the White House in order to reaffirm their belief that  most violence in our (their) community is coming from the police departments, and something needs to be done about it.  On December 20th  something was done about it  as two uniformed NYPD officers were assassinated in their marked car by Ismaaiyl Brinsley in what Brinsley himself boasted as an act of retaliation for the death of Michael Brown in Missouri and Eric Garner in New York at the hands of the police.Ashley Yates, BLM Organizer who created t-shirt praising cop killer, Assata ShakurThe reason Yates is emphasized here is because she, like BlackLivesMatter founder Alicia Garza, praise cop killer and former Black Liberation member Assata Shakur as a martyr for their cause.Alicia Garza, BLM founderYates even created T-shirts and hoodies that read  ASSATA TAUGHT ME  in a reference to Shakur that has become part of BLM s iconography. The fact that the president would even entertain the thought of meeting with those like Yates and other  activists  who hold cop killers as icons for their movement further goes to show how Obama s belief in Black Liberation theology, primarily that retaliation and violence should be used to further their cause, has never left him. Why else would Obama have met with these  activists  unless he was sympathetic to their plight, which given the fact that Obama spent over twenty years of his life listening to Jeremiah Wright s sermons, he very much is. Since this meeting though, what cannot be dismissed is the fact that violence in the form of targeted assassinations of both white people and police officers, have ramped up.And it will only get worse the longer we continue to allow Obama s Department of Justice to remain idly complicit.Via: Politically Short",politics,"Sep 8, 2015",8562

 Trump’s Meeting With Germany’s Angela Merkel Goes From Awkward To Offensive In Seconds (VIDEO),"A sit-down meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel went from painfully awkward to downright offensive when Trump couldn t even muster an ounce of humility and grace. During a photo op, the two world leaders sat in stony silence as photographers did their best to try to capture a picture that showed some warmth between what are supposed to be two close allies. Instead they got Trump looking like his dad just told him they wouldn t be getting ice cream after all and Merkel squirming in discomfort.Trump s obvious irritability was bizarre to begin with, but his refusal to interact with Merkel only got worse. When a reporter suggested the pair give a handshake (as is customary when two leaders meet for the first time), Merkel leaned over to Trump to ask if he wanted to give it a go only to have Trump continue to stare straight ahead, ignoring her. She stared in astonishment, then resignation. The realization that the President of the United States really is this pathetic was written all over her face.Photographers: Can we get a handshake? Merkel (to Trump): Do you want to have a handshake? Trump: *no response* Merkel: *makes awkward face* pic.twitter.com/ehgpCnWPg7  David Mack (@davidmackau) March 17, 2017Trump could have been in a bad mood for any number of reasons. His healthcare plan is going down in flames. His budget cuts   which focus primarily on stripping funding away from the elderly and children in favor of more military spending   are getting some of the worst press since his Muslim ban. His second Muslim ban was just shot down by two federal judges. And his plan to accuse the British government of helping Obama wiretap him didn t just blow up in his face, but actually caused an international scandal. Or it could be the fact that Germany has shown zero interest in indulging his tantrums.Whatever the cause, America just got another clear reminder that the damage Trump is doing isn t just domestic. He s undermining relationships with crucial allies in ways that may take decades to repair. And he s not even willing to give a simple handshake to prevent it.Featured image via Twitter",News,"March 17, 2017",2126

 WATCH: Fox Host Declares GOP Trumpcare Failure A Victory For President Obama,"President Obama has finally been vindicated after seven years of Republican attacks on the Affordable Care Act resulted in humiliating failure on Friday.Once again, Republicans were forced to cancel a floor vote for their Trumpcare bill the day after previously pulling it because many Republicans couldn t bring themselves to vote for such a terrible piece of legislation.The bill would have repealed the Affordable Care Act, stripping healthcare from over 20 million Americans and causing healthcare premiums to skyrocket.Donald Trump, of course, immediately blamed Democrats for the defeat even though Republicans control the House, Senate, and the White House.In short, Republicans only have themselves to blame because they are the ones who tried to replace the Affordable Care Act with a plan that was just awful and universally opposed across the country.Adding insult to injury, Fox News anchor Bret Baier forcefully pointed out that while Republicans went down in flames, President Obama won the day. Let me just say one thing, the biggest winner today: President Barack Obama, who came out this week and defended his legacy healthcare law,  Baier began.  It is now clear that Republicans cannot do, at least yet, what they planned on doing in the campaign, after campaign from 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016,  repeal and replace  was the mantra. Indeed, Republicans rehearsed their repeal of the Affordable Care Act incessantly, holding over 60 useless symbolic votes over the years. But when push came to shove, Republicans demonstrated that they are incapable of governing even when they control every branch of government. Barack Obama has the win right now, and it has changed the entire way that we look at healthcare,  Baier continued.  It is now the Democrats  version, the ideology, that government does have a role in providing healthcare in some way shape or form. Thousands of Americans across the country showed up at town halls to confront Republicans in defense of the Affordable Care Act and only 17 percent of Americans approved of their bill.And in the end, not enough Republicans were willing to commit political suicide by supporting the bill and decided to stand against it instead.In conclusion, Baier echoed Fox Business host Stuart Varney by noting that Republicans control Congress and the White House but still could not get anything done. The repeal, drag it up by the root has not worked,  Baier said.  They can t get it through a Republican House, a Republican Senate and a Republican president. Today is a win for President Barack Obama. Here s the video via YouTube.Americans should remain vigilant, however, and continue to watch Republicans closely to make sure they don t try to sneak the bill through. Just like the Affordable Care Act failed a few times before it passed, the GOP could always bring up their terrible bill again for another vote. It will be up to each and every one of us to make sure they fail again. But for now, the Affordable Care Act is the law and Republicans should accept that and get over it.Featured image via Pete Souza",News,"March 24, 2017",3083
" Marco ‘Roboto’ Rubio Short-Circuits Again, Repeats Same Line Twice In 30 Seconds (VIDEO)","Once a broken record, always a broken record. At least that s what Marco Rubio has been demonstrating since his disastrous debate performance on Saturday.As you ll recall, Chris Christie absolutely hammered Rubio for using a canned line about President Obama over and over again. Let s dispel once and for all with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn t know what he s doing,  Rubio said during his exchange with the New Jersey governor.  He knows exactly what he s doing. He went on to repeat the line several more times, leading to Christie nailing Rubio for being scripted.Rubio s robotic performance has inspired people to troll him by dressing up and appearing at Rubio rallies as robots.One would think that Rubio would more carefully monitor his speeches to make sure that he doesn t come off as a broken record, but he either doesn t give a damn or he thinks voters are stupid and won t notice.On Tuesday, Rubio repeated himself once again during a rally in New Hampshire as he talked about raising his children in the 21st Century, and he actually repeated the same line twice back-to-back. Because as you saw, Jeanette and I are raising our four children in the 21st century and we know how hard it s become to instill our values in our kids instead of the values they try to ram down our throats. In the 21st century it s become harder than ever to instill in your children the values they teach in our homes and in our church instead of the values that they try to ram down our throats in the movies, in music, in popular culture. Here s the video via YouTube:Clearly, Marco Rubio is having a hard time shaking the appearance of being a scripted robot who glitches out, which certainly does not help him look like a viable candidate for president. Not only do we not need a president who will repeat the disastrous policies of past Republican presidents, we do not need a president who relies on canned lines to communicate with the American people.Featured Image: Flickr",News,"February 9, 2016",1983
 Stephen King Plows Through What’s Left Of Disgraced GOP Governor LePage’s Dignity (TWEET),"Being a resident of the beautiful state of Maine myself, I have a special place in my heart for Stephen King. His vocal opposition   or rather downright hatred   for Republican Governor Paul LePage has made him even more likable to those of us who have witnessed the second-term antics and complete disintegration of what little integrity  Governor LeRampage  had left.His first term was a nightmare. His re-election was made possible by a third-party run from a rich buddy pretending to be a Democrat. Watching him campaign on a platform of hatred for the poor and fear of the few thousand Somali refugees living in the Portland area was terrifying, especially when it became apparent that he would win a second term.In that second term, LeRampage has amped up his fight for the wealthy, essentially destroying the food stamp program and creating a quagmire of restrictions and red tape to sort through for any other kind of assistance that people have stopped bothering to try, opting instead to reverse Lepage s one victory as governor by increasing the crime rate that was at a 40-year low.People gotta eat. When the governor takes away their means without providing an environment that creates sufficient jobs, they do whatever they can to feed themselves and their families. They aren t running to the supermarket with the promise of lower property taxes for oceanfront millionaires.After LePage s latest racist rant sparked outrage around the country, Stephen King, whose tweets at LeRampage have earned him quite a few hearts and arrows on Twitter, sent this out on Sunday, tearing down what little dignity the governor may have had left:One must admit LePage has elevated assholery to a level far past the extraordinary and into a rarified sphere that might be termed divine.  Stephen King (@StephenKing) January 8, 2016Ahhhh The beauty of a Stephen King passage that will stand the test of time. The man just has a way with words. By taking everything the failed governor has ever done and reducing it to a single act of  divine  a**holery, King has summed up the feelings and frustrations of hundreds of thousands of Mainers who lament that they allowed this man to be elected, never mind re-elected.Thank you, Stephen King, for this wonderful tweet. And for Pet Semetary. Still one of my favorites.Featured image via Twitter",News,"January 11, 2016",2336
SPOT ON! MARK STEYN Delivers A Dire Warning To The Never Trump Folks," Hillary is the embodiment of corruption and therefore the death of the republic  said author and political commentator Mark SteynThe brilliant Mark Steyn is always spot on in his commentary. He s one of our favorite political commentators. He sent a message to anyone even remotely considering voting for Hillary and it s a perfect assessment of what will happen if Hillary becomes president. Author and political commentator Mark Steyn is warning that a Hillary Clinton presidency would mark the beginning of the end of the republic. This is insane,  Steyn said Monday.  The Hillary Rodham Clinton presidency will be the death of the republic and the complete descent into banana republic status. His remarks came as he sat in for talk radio host Rush Limbaugh. He started first by excoriating the Clinton Foundation, which he said is a none-too-subtle slush fund by which the wealthy can access power and exert their influence. It s corrupt. It s stingily corrupt, it s obviously corrupt,  he said.  Hillary is the embodiment of corruption and therefore the death of the republic.  To decide someone on the take from Saudi princes, someone s whose managed to deliver 20 percent of U.S. uranium into control of the Russians, someone whose husband has been credibly accused of rape and flies around with a known pedophile, and yet Hillary to these guys is who they re going to be supporting in November,  he added.He also criticized conservatives, including P.J. O Rourke, who ve said they would likely vote for Clinton over presumed GOP nominee Donald Trump.Via: WE",politics,"May 17, 2016",1567
" BREAKING: Benghazi Committee Shuts Down After Trump Win, Proving It Was Just A Clinton Witch Hunt","It s finally over. Now that Donald Trump has been kinda-sorta elected president by a historic minority of voters and a system put in place thanks to lobbying by slave owners, Republicans have decided that a headline-grabbing fake investigation into Hillary Clinton just isn t necessary anymore.In multiple desperate attempts to blame the tragic Benghazi terrorist attacks on Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, Republicans spent years betraying taxpayers by knowingly wasting millions of their dollars doing their best not to uncover the truth, but to turn public perception against the president and the former secretary of state. Principled  conservatives and other stupid people rallied around the cause as Trump and Stein supporters, unable to tell fact from fiction, used Benghazi and any other fake scandal they heard about on Infowars to demand that Clinton be jailed or even executed for imagined crimes.Yes, it was propaganda   it was effective taxpayer-funded propaganda. But it s over now. Trump will be our next president, the committee has lost interest, and (most importantly),  the truth of the millions-of-dollars-worth of investigations is laid bare: it was all an effort to hoodwink voters. Every. Single. Bit. Of. It.While the panel s chairman, Trey Gowdy, loudly trumpeted every facet of this witch hunt at every step of the way, the final report was added to the official house record without so much as a peep from him. The reason? He d accomplished his purpose. There s no longer any need for him to abuse his position to play politics now that the game he was playing is over. USA Today has a nice rundown of the damage that was done:The special committee was created in May 2014 to investigate the terrorist attacks at the U.S. compound in eastern Libya where four Americans died, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens.In June, the Benghazi Committee report was endorsed by the Republican committee members but not the Democrats. It severely criticized military, CIA and Obama administration officials for their response as the attacks unfolded and their subsequent explanations to the American people. It accused the government of incompetence at various levels, including a failure to deploy needed military assets, CIA intelligence reports that were  rife with errors,  and misguided planning even in the midst of the violence. The report did not single out wrongdoing by then-secretary of State Hillary Clinton, although some Republicans on the panel alleged that overall concern for her political future influenced and hampered some of the decision-making surrounding policy in Libya.Clinton s use of a private email server while she was secretary of State was revealed as part of the Benghazi investigation, but the committee did not investigate whether the setup led to improper handling of classified information. The FBI declined to pursue criminal charges regarding the email system, but it was a major issue in the 2016 presidential election.Gowdy on Monday called the report the  final, definitive accounting  of the Benghazi attacks. The committee is proud to have been able to tell the story of the ingenuity and bravery displayed by our nation s heroes in Benghazi, who banded together to save one another when no other help was ever on the way,  Gowdy said when asked about the report. But Rep. Elijah Cummings, the panel s Batman to Gowdy s Aryan Joker, was quick to call it what it was. Republicans voted on this partisan report five months ago, but delayed filing it and completing the committee until after the election,  Cummings says.  Republicans promised a process that was fair and bipartisan, but the American people got exactly the opposite. If any Republican mentions any aspect of the Benghazi investigation to you ever again, be sure to point out that conservative  principles  only exist long enough for them to work to someone s political benefit. Then they just disappear like this investigation did after Trump  won  and Ebola after the midterms.Featured image via Getty Images/Mark Wilson",News,"December 13, 2016",4049
 Mike Huckabee Just Tried To Compliment Trump And COMPLETELY F***ed It Up (TWEETS),"Republican nominee Donald Trump definitely has the worst surrogates out of anyone who has ever run for President. They can barely keep their stories (lies) straight, and have a really difficult time talking positively about their candidate at this point in the race, after his campaign as been riddled with scandals, lawsuits, and sexual assault allegations.Something absolutely ridiculous happened today on Twitter when former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee decided to make a case for why Trump was the better candidate for President. As expected, this pathetic attempt at some Trump praise went horribly wrong when Huckabee referred to Trump as a  car wreck    but at least one that s  pointed in the right direction.  Huckabee tried to argue that this was better than Clinton, who he described as  a drunk driver going the wrong way down the freeway. TwitterNot only is the metaphor problematic   as the former presidential candidate is already saying that Trump has ruined everything in a crash   but it didn t take long before Twitter users tore the metaphor and Huckabee s reasoning to shreds:TwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterHuckabee s weird compliment is so reminiscent of what happens with many of Trump s surrogates. Another former rival-turned-supporter, Ben Carson, has become infamous for giving Trump back-handed compliments. And as Trump s campaign continued on, we witnessed Trump s supporters having a more difficult time defending the business mogul s erratic behavior and insane statements.Huckabee   and many other Republicans that continue to support Trump   know that he s an absolute disaster for the GOP, but they d rather stay loyal to their party and worry about the Supreme Court than actually do what s best for America. Huckabee called Trump exactly what he was in his tweet   a wreck   and any GOPer who is aware of this and continues to support Trump is as unethical and spineless as he is.Featured image via Christopher Furlong/Getty Images",News,"November 4, 2016",1964
WATCH: SARAH HUCKABEE-SANDERS Mocks Media For Ignoring Public Testimony Proving Fake Russian Dossier Was Part Of “Witch Hunt or Hoax”,"Sarah Huckabee Sanders has taken control of the media and is no longer allowing them to push a false narrative when it comes to President Trump and a non-existant Russian connection.Time and time again, Sanders has proven she s no pushover when it comes to the rabid leftist media who would love nothing more than to be able to sabotage her during her press briefings. Yesterday was no exception. With a smile on her face, Sanders called out the media for ignoring the biggest story of the day.  The one day there might have been a question on Russia, there wasn t. Often, we have a lot of uh, media with  Russia first , and uh, but today, there was public testimony that further discredited the phony dossier that s been the source of so much of the fake news and conspiracy theories.

LEFT GOES NUTS After Antifa Woman Attacking Trump Supporter Got Punched…That Was Before This Photo Revealed What She Had In Her Hand [VIDEO],"Yesterday, Antifa (anarchists and free-speech terrorists) and other various violent anti-Trump groups (many paid by Soros funded organizations) made their way to Berkeley, CA to shut down another pro-Trump rally. The last time these two group clashed, the Trump supporters were seriously outnumbered. This time was a different story. Trump supporters came prepared for the unprovoked attacks of these hate groups and took them to task. With all the violence that happened yesterday, leftist media outlets seemed to be obsessed with reporting on the video that was taken of an alleged Trump supporter who punched an antifa female who was part of the violent group  Oak Roots Collective  that traveled to Berkeley to confront Trump supporters and shut down their right to free speech.Here s the video. At the 18 second mark you can see the woman cock her arm back as though she is about to swing her arm at someone. When she brings her arm forward, that is where she gets hit. We are NOT condoning the hitting of a woman by a man, but if she had a bottle in her hand and was about to hit someone that changes everything:CBS San Fransisco Bay Area news interviewed anarchist Louise Rosealma, who along with her boyfriend is a member of the Oak Roots Collective. Here s a sample of the violence they promote on their Facebook page. This is how these people (that should be labeled as domestic terrorists) see themselves. These anarchists live in a world where it s okay to act with violence against law enforcement and innocent people who don t agree with their political views:Reseal explained to the CBS reporter (in a very sweet voice) how she was just happened to be with her boyfriend, and how he lost her and the next thing she know she was surrounded. Next, she explains that completely unprovoked, from the corner of her eye, she just saw a fist coming at her. She claimed she got punched in the nose and that it was cut, but that was last night, and (of course) it s already healed. According to the antifa member, she was also punched several times and then after she was down, she was  kneed  several times in the forehead (which is also completely unbruised and miraculously healed). She also claims the Trump supporters were  trying to crush her skull on the curbs and on the planters.  She says she didn t exchange any words with anyone, that she was just being attacked. According to Rosealma, she was also pepper sprayed several times in the face but somehow managed to find her boyfriend who was  soaked in blood . It never occurred to either one of them to press charges though? Most people would find that slightly odd for someone who was just there for the fun of it. Wow! I wonder if her boyfriend looks as good as she does today?After her long and totally embellished story to this CBS SF Bay reporter, we thought we d share this picture of the innocent anarchist that just surfaced. The picture appears to be taken just before she got punched, and by the looks of this picture it appears she was about to hit this man with a large glass bottle (circled in photo below) which would account for his response.There was violence on both sides yesterday, but in defense of the Trump supporters, this violence has been perpetuated against them (even paid for by George Soros groups and Democrat activist groups) since the days of Trump s campaign rallies. Many have warned that Trump supporters are not going to put up with the unprovoked violence forever and when they fought back, many warned the basement dwellers on the Democrat side wouldn t fare to well. That s exactly what happened yesterday in Berkeley, CA.Here s citizen journalist Tim Pool talking to the Antifa female who was hit. When he asks her if she thinks it s okay that Antifa rioters threw M-80 s at people on the Trump side, her response was,  Well, the revolution isn t f*cking easy!

 Huge Progressive Group Demands Debbie Wasserman-Schultz Immediately Resign As DNC Chair,"Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz has been under a tremendous amount of fire lately for what some Democrats perceive as a vendetta against Senator Bernie Sanders. Liberals have accused the DNC chair of  fixing  the primary in Hillary Clinton s favor and there have been many calls for her to step aside. Now, a large progressive group is adding their voice to the fray after comments the chairwoman made in the New York Times Magazine about Roe v. Wade.CREDO Mobile, a phone company that uses their profits to fund liberal causes and has a network of more than 3.6 million people, started a petition calling for Wasserman-Schultz s resignation. The petition was prompted by an interview that was published Wednesday morning in which the chairwoman said there is  a complacency among the generation of young women whose entire lives have been lived after Roe v. Wade was decided. The comments garnered immediate backlash as women took to Twitter and lashed out at her using the hashtag #DearDebbie. She later clarified her remarks, saying: For many in my generation who lived the majority of our lives with the right to make our own health care choices, there wasn t a sense of urgency after Roe v. Wade settled our right to a safe and legal abortion. Since then, opponents worked aggressively to chip away at women s reproductive freedom and they have awakened a sleeping giant in the millennials leading the fight in defense of the progress we ve made. CREDO fired back at Wasserman-Schultz with the petition demanding she step down, claiming:Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz just accused young women of  complacency  in the fight for abortion rights.Young women, especially low income women and women of color, have been bearing the brunt of the right-wing s relentless assault on abortion rights and have been leading the charge to fight back. Wasserman Schultz s comment shows how out of touch she is with the progressive core values of the Democratic activist base, and is just the latest in a string of unacceptable actions that makes it clear it is time for her to resign as chair of the DNC.The group also accused her of rigging the primary to  suppress Democratic turnout,  putting her personal interests before the party, trying to sabotage the president s Iran deal, and siding  with anti-progressive special interests. Whether you agree with CREDO or not, the debacle on Wednesday and the others in the months leading up to it, show that there is a rift forming in the party that is not good for us. With the primaries right around the corner and the general election just months away, we need to unite for the good of our party. The infighting is unhealthy and the more divided we become, the better the chances are that we could see a Republican in the White House. Do you really want a President Donald Trump or President Ted Cruz?It is time to put our differences aside and focus on beating the GOP in November; we can handle everything else afterward.Featured image via Florida Politics",News,"January 7, 2016",3068
WATCH: JOEL OSTEEN FACES WRATH OF ANGRY CHRISTIANS After He Gives Reason For Locking Church Doors To Devastated Houston Flood Victims,"The popular evangelical preacher and inspirational speaker may have permanently damaged his brand with what many consider a very lame answer to the question about why his church locked out the neediest people in his community, who were devastated by the floods in Houston and surrounding areas, while he remained high and dry in his $10 million mansion Showing off a toothy grin and posing in front of stacks of donated food and diapers, televangelist Joel Osteen showed not a shred of remorse as he appeared on the Today show on Wednesday.Proudly, he declared that the doors of his 17,000 seat Texas megachurch had  always been open  to the people of Houston who have been rendered homeless by Hurricane Harvey and its devastating floods.It came after shocked Texans arrived at his Lakewood church on Sunday to find it free of flood water on the ground level despite a Facebook post issued at the height of the city s panic which claimed it was  inaccessible due to flooding .Osteen, still shirking responsibility for the decision, then said that the church chose not to open up to the needy because the city had not officially asked him to. This despite other locations in Houston inviting in refugees out of charity and not an official request.Did Osteen really say he didn t open the church to flood victims because the city didn t ask him to? Does a church need to be asked by the government to help people affected by a natural disaster in their community?Eventually, it opened up and it is now acting as a  distribution center , finally carrying out good and much needed work as the city reels in crisis.But Osteen now faces the wrath of an angry Christian community   and the disgust of those beyond it   for his treatment of the disaster.  Daily MailApparently, many folks on social media didn t feel as though the pastor, who also happens to be mega-rich, is doing enough to help the people who have supported his luxury lifestyle for years.Twitter user @CollinRugg reminded Olsteen that the church belongs to God and not to him.

 WATCH: Chuck Todd HUMILIATES Rudy Giuliani After He Pathetically Defends Trump,"Appearing on NBC s Meet The Press Sunday morning, Rudy Giuliani continued his efforts to defend Donald Trump. With Trump s campaign falling apart and the rest of the GOP quickly abandoning their presidential nominee, Giulini has continued to stump for Trump despite the fact that Trump is now being skewered by both Democrats and Republicans over his violently misogynistic remarks regarding groping women.It didn t take very long for the show s host Chuck Todd to show what it means to be a friend of Trump at the moment. Giuliani, who recently defended Trump s  grab her by the pussy  comment by saying that  The fact is men, at times, talk like that,  was forced to listen to audio recordings where Trump used vile misogynistic language. Because his cognitive dissonance apparently knows no limits, Giuliani offered another pathetic attempt to defend Trump. Still, he wasn t running for president,  Giulini says.Todd responds perfectly saying: Oh, he wasn t running for president so it s OK to be a misogynist. He wasn t running for president so it s OK to make unwanted sexual advances? That s a good counterpoint to have on hand for the rest of the election. Assuming Trump doesn t drop out of the race, his campaign is going to desperately try to position him as a reformed sinner, to appeal to moderate Christian right. A critical demographic of consistent voters Trump needs in toss-up states.At that point, Giuliani tried desperately to pivot to talking about recently leaked portions of transcripts from paid speeches that Hillary Clinton gave. Todd then asks Giulini an excellent question that proves that Giuliani had just bit himself on the ass with that pivot attempt. If you believe that Hillary Clinton says one thing in private and that means what she really is, is what she is in private, should we assume what Donald Trump did   is really what Donald Trump is like in private? That s what you re implying here with Hillary Clinton.

 Economist Responsible For ‘Reaganomics’ Makes Laughable 2016 Election Prediction,"Arthur Laffer, known for inspiring Republican economic ideology since the Reagan-era, and largely considered to be the father of supply-side economics, has just come out with another prediction. No, not another false trickle-down theory of  if you cut taxes on the rich  governmental revenues will somehow maximize, and we ll all be better off   this time he is weighing in on the outcome of the 2016 election.Not only does he think Republicans will win in a  landslide,  he thinks they re going to win practically every state. Here s what he told host John Catsimatidis on New York s AM-970 on Sunday: I would be surprised if the Republicans don t take 45, 46, 47 states out of the 50. I mean, I think we re going to landslide this election. That s some estimation on his part. The last time that happened was when Walter Mondale was running for president against Ronald Reagan. That was three decades ago   this guy must still be living in the 1980s. Since then most economists have come out on the record stating his economic theories have been wrong, and that  trickle-down  economics is straight up bogus. His  Laffer-curve  even has it s own laughable tag line: Laughing at the Laffer- Curve. Governmental revenues have declined since it was first implemented, giving tax cuts to the rich that ultimately hurt the economy AND the federal government s source of income. Still, that hasn t kept him from being a big wig within top Republican circles. Hey   rich guys like their tax cuts, we get it. Now they ll do anything and everything to keep on justifying those lower tax rates they have become accustomed to.Here s what else he had to say in the interview: When I look at these candidates, I don t see one of them who wouldn t do a great job as president. I think Donald Trump is phenomenal, I think Rand Paul has done a great job, I even like Jeb Bush   I think Jeb Bush is great, he did a wonderful job in Florida. Chris Christie   phenomenal. He also took a few jabs at Hillary Clinton, but pretended to be nice about it, saying that her  day is over. We get that he s a fan of Republicans, but there is no hard data to suggest even what he is predicting. It would be interesting if he could cite some source or reference for why he thinks Republicans are going to win practically every state, or why he would be  surprised  if they didn t. Yet   he doesn t provide any of that.If his 2016 election prediction is anything like his economic policies, you can rest assured it s flat-out wrong.Featured image via Laffer Center.",News,"January 10, 2016",2536
" BREAKING: Martin ‘Pharma Bro’ Shkreli Has Bail Revoked, Hauled To The Slammer","Martin Shkreli quickly gained notoriety during the contentious 2016 presidential campaign by price gouging in a monopoly on a vital, life-saving HIV drug.

After that, legal battles ensued, and Shkreli was eventually convicted of securities fraud. His original arrest was captured on camera in an absolutely humiliating live perp walk to the satisfaction of decent human beings everywhere. Of course, he is rich, so he was out of jail on bail.

" John Oliver Finally Takes Aim At Donald Trump, Destroys Him On EVERYTHING (VIDEO)","The one thing John Oliver hasn t talked about on his show so far is Donald Trump, but that changed on Sunday night.The HBO host devoted nearly his entire program to ripping apart the Republican billionaire as if he had been biding his time waiting for the perfect moment to strike. Our main story tonight   and I can not believe I m saying this   is Donald Trump, and I say that knowing that every time his name gets said out loud, he has a shattering orgasm,  Oliver hilarious began.Like a small mole discovered on your back, Oliver continued, Trump has grown to the point where you have to start taking him seriously.Trump has not only won New Hampshire and South Carolina, he is now poised to win big on Super Tuesday, which could seal the nomination for him.But Oliver absolutely destroyed Trump and it became really obvious that he and his team did a lot of research in an effort to hit Trump as hard as possible. Donald Trump can seem appealing until you take a closer look,  Oliver said.  Much like the lunch buffet at a strip club. Or the NFL. Or having a pet chimpanzee. Sure, it seems fun, but someday Coco is going to rip your f*cking limbs off. Oliver took aim at Trump s net worth, which The Donald proudly claims is at least  TEN BILLION DOLLARS.  However, Oliver noted that in reality Trump is  worth a mere $150 to $250 million dollars. Then it was time to take a closer look at Trump s claim that he is successful at everything he does, and even that doesn t hold water. From Trump Vodka to Trump Steaks to Trump University, Donald Trump has repeatedly failed in multiple business ventures. He s even incredibly thin-skinned, as Oliver discovered when he pointed out that Trump sends an occasional letter to Vanity Fair with a picture of his hand highlighting the length of his fingers after the magazine claimed that he has  tiny, cocktail sausage fingers. The in-depth mockery of Trump by Oliver was simply amazing over the full 21 minutes the segment lasted, which hilariously concluded with the comedian reaching back into Trump s family history to find out that Trump s real last name is Drumpf. And that inspired Oliver to buy www.donaldjdrumpf.com to Make Donald Drumpf Again.Here s the video via YouTube:Oliver also summed up Trump s candidacy as a  bullshit artist selling a shitty lifestyle  to the American people.We may have had to wait a long time to see Oliver take on Trump, but it sure was worth the wait.Featured image via screenshot",News,"February 29, 2016",2467
JAPANESE SCHOOLS DON’T EMPLOY JANITORS…Why Americans Should Demand Our Schools Adopt The Same Policy [VIDEO],"Watch NPR employee and Afghanistan refugee (who was eventually arrested) join others as they block our newly appointed Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos from entering a school in DC on her first day on the job:Back in 2011, Newt Gingrich was running for president, and he proposed a radical idea to help schools cut costs: Fire the janitors and pay students to do the cleaning.Needless to say, the idea to turn students into moonlighting janitors had about as much support as Gingrich s presidential campaign.But ask Kim De Costa and she ll say there isn t anything radical about asking students to clean up after themselves. At her school, there are no janitors. Instead, students in grades 6-12 meet in teams once or twice a week to clean assigned areas.De Costa is the executive director of the Armadillo Technical Institute. It s a public charter school in Phoenix, Ore., a few miles from the California border.For 30 minutes after lunch, students sweep, mop, take out the trash and even clean the bathrooms   but responsibilities rotate so no one is stuck scrubbing toilets more than two or three times a year.De Costa says it s easy to encourage students to respect their environment when they re the ones responsible for preserving it. We really wanted a school where the students took ownership and made it their own,  says De Costa, who helped found ATI in 1999.The school still has maintenance staff for the difficult or dangerous work. But for the most part, students at ATI handle the daily upkeep. And with a little help from peer pressure, the school stays clean.Eden Cox, a 10th-grader, says that recently she had to confront a classmate after he left a mess behind.  I got on to him and said,  Can you please throw your trash away so I don t have to,    Cox recalls. After all, it s our school,  she says, with an emphasis on  our. Places like ATI that build cleanup into the curriculum are rare in the United States.But in Japan, there s a long tradition of students cleaning their own schools.There,  school is not just for learning from a book,  says Michael Auslin   a former English teacher in Japan.  It s about learning how to become a member of society and taking responsibility for oneself,  says Auslin, who is now a resident scholar and director of Japan studies at the American Enterprise Institute.To make cleaning easier, Japanese students put on slippers before entering the classroom to prevent dirt from being dragged into the room.Many Hands Make Light WorkAt Brentwood Academy outside Nashville, Tenn., keeping the school spick-and-span is just part of the daily routine for students.Each day before P.E., students at the private prep school report for 10 minutes of  clean-up  duty in their assigned areas.Susan Shafer, the school s director of communications, considers  clean-up  an additional component of the school s mission of educating the whole person. We re trying to train them for life,  says Shafer.  They re all going to go to college. No one is going to clean their dorm room for them. Maddie Jarrard, an 11th-grader, is responsible for dusting a classroom every day. She says even after sports games, Brentwood players are expected to stay behind to pick up any trash left in the stands. They re not only trying to keep the place clean,  says Jarrard, referring to Brentwood s staff.  But they re also trying to build character in each student. While some parents might balk at the idea of a school taking time away from class to make students push a broom, educators at both ATI and Brentwood both say that parents have shown overwhelming support.

"OBAMA’S GITMO BOARD RELEASES “High Risk” Explosive’s Expert, Al-Qaeda Trainer","While Obama golfs in Martha s Vineyard, yet another  decision is made to allow a terrorist to return to his homeland. Way to honor our troops who have lost their lives to these evil men Barry President Barack Obama s multi-agency Periodic Review Board (PRB) has approved an al Qaeda-linked Algerian prisoner for release from the U.S. military detention center in Guant namo Bay, Cuba, conceding that the jihadist  presents some level of threat. However, PRB claims that the threat posed by the 43-year-old, Sufiyan Barhoumi, can be  adequately mitigated,  in part due to  his lack of extremist views. At one point, the Pentagon deemed the prisoner to be  high risk,  linked to key al Qaeda leadership, and accused him of participating in  hostilities against the US and coalition forces. Barhoumi was identified by the Pentagon as an explosive s expert and Al-Qaeda trainer.He has been held at Guant namo since mid June 2002 and on Tuesday became the second detainee to be approved for release by the Gitmo board after presenting a letter of support from a former guard, notes the Miami Herald.In a statement announcing its latest decision, Obama s parole board notes:The Board recommends repatriation to Algeria due to the detainees strong family support and Algeria s strong record in prior transfers, with security appropriate security assurances as negotiated by the Special Envoys and agreed by relevant USG [US government] departments and agencies.Algeria has been listed by the U.S. government as a terrorism-linked country.Barhoumi presented PRB with a detailed plan to open a pizza shop near his mom in the Algerian capital of Algiers, reports the Miami Herald.For entire story: Breitbart News",Government News,"Aug 14, 2016",1702
 ‘WHO’S SPYING ON US?’: Bundy Militia FLIPS Over ‘Hidden’ Cameras In Plain View (VIDEO),"The armed militants occupying federal property in Oregon still haven t been arrested   but they are absolutely continuing to do damage. Unsatisfied with tearing down fences and building roads, disrupting the delicate ecosystem, Y all Qaeda is on a hunt for something even more dangerous to humanity than a tyrannical bird sanctuary: cameras.The pretend militia chose perhaps the only person whose hands aren t covered with some of the 55 gallons of lube a good samaritan sent them to climb a ladder and investigate the creepy science box.The box itself, which has a sticker reading  SCADA CIRCUIT 10  on the outside, doesn t try to hide what it is.  SCADA  stands for   supervisory control and data acquisition,  as a simple Google search can tell you, but these folks apparently lack the computer expertise needed to do more than visit World Net Daily s website. There s also a blinking red light, an antenna, and a  WiFi in use  sticker.  In other words, it is very clearly a not-so-hidden camera.While most would expect cameras to cover a federal wildlife preserve, the Armed and Stupid were completely taken aback by this development. The  militiaman  up the pole struggled to open the housing, so he solved the problem in the traditional Bundy way   by hitting it with something. What s that look like to you,  he yelled to his posse.  This is United States federal government surveillance. Welcome to America. I m tellin  you! Who s spying on us?  a woman yelled, as though the cameras were in place simply to keep an eye on them. Your federal government,  Utility Pole Guy replied.  Wake up people. Ammon Bundy, a product of generations and generations of inbreeding, shared his thoughts on the matter: This tells me that, uh, the government wants to be oppressive. They gotta watch us, control us, and use these things to do that with. This is not what it means to be free. A free people does not need to be watched. A free people needs to be left alone. Wake up America,  Bundy said.  Let s get our freedom back,  adding that the cameras are a  sophisticated piece of equipment    though to be fair, a spoon is a sophisticated piece of equipment to Bundy.The Bundy terrorists then dismantled the cameras because they re  sick of being spied on  as they illegally occupy property that is nowhere close to theirs. Then, of course, they were off to hunt for more signs of government oppression.The footage of the Bundy idiots discovering that cameras exist is downright hilarious. Of course, there s always the possibility that the cameras are not government cameras at all.  There s also the possibility that the cameras belong to the electric company, since they seem to be pointed directly at a substation located near the property,  Winning Democrats  Charles Topher notes.

 Obama Invades Iran With A Moderate Reformist Government–Defies GOP Logic Of Democracy Via War,"How many times more are we going to get to say this before 2017?  While Republicans were bashing Obama for <insert situation here>, he was busy taking care of the same problem they were crying about better than they ever could have hoped to do.  This is a common theme between Republicans and President Obama. Every time President Obama does something good, they call it the biggest disaster imaginable. Do they think we re not watching?Remember during President Obama s Iranian nuclear deal, when Republicans said  going easy  on Iran (translation   not invading their country) would only make them a worse threat?Huge shock incoming: literally nothing Republicans swore would happen from the Iran deal happened. In fact, yet again the exact opposite happened.The latest proof of President Obama s phenomenal and historic success comes with news of the recent Iranian elections. Supporters of Hassan Rouhani swept to power in run-off elections that gave the Iranian moderate reformist movement legislative control of the Iranian parliament for the first time in over 10 years.Forty-two percent of the total seats were won by Rouhani s moderate supporters. Independents took nearly 30 percent of the remaining seats, and the vast majority of them are also moderate reformists. This leaves a paltry 28 percent left for the Iranian hardliners, which essentially amounts to a seat at the  kid s table,  where their rhetoric means diddly squat and they can do no legislative harm.The landslide success of the Iranian moderate reformists has been linked directly to the success of the nuclear agreement reached between President Rouhani and the United States. The deal brought a great amount of both social and financial relief to the people of Iran, and Rouhani s big win is being viewed as an endorsement of it by the Iranian people.The seriousness of this would be difficult to overstate. President Obama not only won on the Iran deal, but he helped move into place a reformist government that could carry things far beyond the deal alone.As if the electoral results were not enough of a statement for a more moderate future in Iran, the first priority of the new government is going to be a bill to guarantee citizens  rights. This is IRAN we are talking about. The idea of citizen rights being the first priority for a newly elected government is astounding, considering they were viewed by most of the world as a terrorist state for decades.While Iran won t be turning into a mirror image of the West anytime soon, just the fact that the nation took such a huge pivot so quickly is all anyone needs to know when it comes to how President Obama did on the Iran deal.Republicans just can t win when it comes to President Obama. Every time they bash the hell out of him in the media for handling a situation poorly, he literally does the exact opposite   quite often simultaneously   while the rest of the world laughs at the GOP.

However, his antics and demeanor are certainly comical and the material he s provided has been a dream come true for late night talk shows and especially the people at Saturday Night Live.

 The GOP Is Quietly Working On A New And VILE Way To Sh*t On American Consumers,"Doesn t Corporate America get enough breaks at the expense of the everyday American? Apparently not, because they re working on a bill that would limit the ability of the American consumer to sue, even in cases of gross negligence and flat-out illegal acts. Already it s difficult to sue due to all the legal fine print that corporations use specifically to make it harder to sue. And now Republicans want to expand and cement corporations immunity from responsibility.Of course, they gave it a name intended to deceive us into believing they re making things more fair for everyone. Leveling the playing field. Things like that. It s called the  Fairness in Class Action Litigation Act of 2017.  It s anything but fair   it tips the balance of lawsuits so far towards corporations that it s obscene.Class action lawsuits  are often the only avenue for Americans to hold corporations accountable if they are victims of widespread illegal behavior.  In other words, victims of fraud and scams, unsafe products and workplaces, and of human and civil rights violations, would have little to no recourse, according to a detailed analysis from Elizabeth Burch from the University of Georgia s School of Law.Other egregious behavior companies could get away with include price fixing, gender discrimination, securities fraud could go unchecked, deceptive or even false advertising could likewise go unchecked, and so much more.Sure, there are laws in place that prohibit all of that, but holding companies truly responsible for the harm that their lawlessness causes involves hurting their bottom line. Do Republicans plan to put inspectors in every corporation there is, just to ensure that they all follow the law? Class-action suits really are our only method of holding a corporation s feet to the fire when they break the law.Should this bill pass, it s anything but  America first,  and as such, it s a major kick in the face to regular consumers. Republicans are disgusting.Featured image by Mark Wilson via Getty Images",News,"March 7, 2017",2021
"LEFTIST FOR A LIVING Changes Position, Turns On Obama, Declares: “This Is A War…Shut Down The Borders…No Visas” [VIDEO]","FLASHBACK: Watch the video below to see Kudlow mock Republicans for their strong defense of closing our borders in his interview with  Gang of Eight  member, Jeff Flake (R-AZ) two years ago. The president had his last chance last Sunday night. And he didn t do it. He is not a wartime commander in chief. In fact, he is not a commander in chief. A hardline shift from an immigration reformer.I know this is not my usual position. But this is a war. Therefore I have come to believe there should be no immigration or visa waivers until the U.S. adopts a completely new system to stop radical Islamic terrorists from entering the country. A wartime lockdown. And a big change in my thinking.ISIS and related Islamic terrorists are already here. More are coming. We must stop them.Until FBI director James Comey gives us the green light, I say seal the borders.Here s what we must do: Completely reform the vetting process for immigrants and foreign visitors. Change the screening process. Come up with a new visa-application review process. Stop this nonsense of marriage-visa fraud. And in the meantime, seal the borders. I agree with Jessica Vaughn, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, who argued many of these points in excellent detail on the National Review website on Friday.Again, why am I taking this hardline position? In the past, I have been an immigration reformer, not a restrictionist. But we are at war. That changes everything.Watch Kudlow demean conservative position on border control and immigration reform to RINO, Rep. Jeff Flake (R-AZ):Let me emphasize that my support for wartime immigration restrictions is not based on religion. I think Donald Trump made a big mistake here. Instead, I agree with this Rupert Murdoch tweet:  Complete refugee pause to fix vetting makes sense. Fortunately, the Republican House voted to tighten restrictions on travel to the U.S. by citizens of 38 nations who presently enter our country without a visa. This covers 20 million visitors a year who are allowed to stay 90 days. And of course this system is abused, big time.But I say seal the borders. People hoping to relocate to the U.S. from Syria, Iraq, and anywhere in the Middle East, and people coming here from France, England, Sweden, and wherever will be upset, at least for a while. There may be some unfairness to this. But I don t care. Wars breed unfairness, just as they breed collateral damage.We may set back tourism. We may anger Saudi princes whose kids are in American schools. But so be it. We need a wartime footing if we are going to protect the American homeland.Of course, President Obama doesn t get it. He never will. Already we should have led NATO into a declaration of war against ISIS. Already we should have pushed a resolution of war against ISIS through the UN Security Council. Already we should have convened meetings with our Mideast allies to formally declare war against ISIS. Already the U.S. Congress should have issued a formal declaration of war against ISIS.The president had his last chance last Sunday night. And he didn t do it. He is not a wartime commander in chief. In fact, he is not a commander in chief.As I have written before, if the U.S. wants to destroy ISIS, it can destroy ISIS. We won t end terrorism around the world. But we can destroy ISIS in Syria and Iraq. Prominent generals are telling us that. Prominent national security strategists are telling us that.So let s do it.If there is to be a true wartime effort to destroy ISIS, our leaders must communicate a sense of urgency and energy. Define the clear goal: the destruction of ISIS. Speak to that goal constantly. Take steps at home and abroad to back up that goal. Lead the country. Rally the country.Republican and Democratic commanders in chief have done this in the past. We must do it again.I don t believe a visa or immigration lockdown here in the U.S. will solve the Islamic terrorist threat. Many other steps must be taken. And I am not suggesting this in the name of religious profiling. Instead, I am hardening my position on immigration because we are at war and I fear we may be losing this war.My shift in thinking comes from a deep desire to strengthen homeland security. Hopefully an immigration freeze will not be in place for very long. But for now I believe we must do it. (By the way, keeping America safe is a prerequisite for growth.)And let me add, as I have in the past, if the U.S. has the will, the urgency, and the energy to destroy ISIS, then we will destroy ISIS.WATCH Kudlow s defense of immigration in this video only one year ago.

LOL! DEMOCRATS’ “Poster Child For Stupidity” Can’t Tell MSNBC Host What Her Party Stands For Besides Hating Trump [VIDEO],"Rep. Maxine Waters (D., Calif.) struggled Friday on MSNBC to explain what the Democratic Party stands for besides opposing President Trump.Waters has been one of the most outspoken critics of Trump in Congress, repeatedly calling for his impeachment and insisting that if investigators  connect the dots,  then his campaign s alleged collusion with Russia will become apparent.Given Waters  public profile as a staunch Trump opponent, MSNBC host Katy Tur asked the lawmaker what Democrats actually stand for beyond opposing Trump s agenda. Congresswoman, what do the Democrats stand for other than being against Donald Trump?  Tur asked.  What do you stand for other than trying to get Donald Trump impeached? Everyone knows that I am the ranking member of the Financial Services Committee and that I have spent many, many hours and days implementing the Dodd-Frank reforms,  Waters responded.The California Democrat proceeded to frame her work on Dodd-Frank in the context of opposing Republicans, which Tur noted. We pushed back on the Republicans, we fight against them,  Waters said.  [They] attempt[ed] to go get rid of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau before we came up with the reforms under Dodd-Frank. Tur pushed back. Are Democrats focusing enough on their ideas?  she asked.Waters then went on to explain how effective the Democrat Party has been in their organizing efforts to disrupt town halls where Republican political leaders are speaking to their constituents. Listen, if you have not been keeping up with the town halls that have been going on,  Waters said, referring to the protesters at many Republican town halls, where we have basically organized America around the [Affordable Care Act] and protected Obamacare and the thousands of people who have come out who now are very much informed about the difference between Obamacare and Trumpcare.   WFBWhat Maxine doesn t understand is that when Tea Party members attended town hall meetings across American and challenged their elected leaders on reckless tax legislation they didn t need to be organized by the Republican Party. Tea Party members weren t just targeting Democrat politicians, they were targeting anyone who they felt wasn t representing the people who elected them into office. ",left-news,"May 20, 2017",2274
" Bernie Sanders Just Got One Of The Most Important Endorsements Of His Campaign, So Far","Bernie Sanders just picked up one of the most important endorsements of his campaign. No, it isn t a politician, pundit, or, celebrity. It is Eric Garner s eldest daughter, Erica Garner. She, like too many others, is a family member of one of the victims of police brutality, and the racism that drives it. Her father s death helped catalyze the Black Lives Matter movement. Erica Garner has since worked as an activist. She is the founder of the Garner Way Foundation.Garner s endorsement comes in the form of a powerful essay, published in the Washington Post. In the endorsement, she writes about her disillusionment with a system that has for so long been able to pretend that the life of her father, her own, and all people of color s lives have mattered.She writes that: If our lives really mattered, we d have equal access to decent jobs, good schools and affordable housing. If our lives mattered in this country, we d have equal access to clean air, clean water and real investment in black neighborhoods. If black lives mattered in America, those who routinely brutalize us wouldn t be the ones paid, with our tax dollars, to keep us safe.I trusted establishment Democrats who claimed to represent me, only to later watch them ignore and explain away the injustice of my father s death. I trusted the system; then I watched as politicians on both sides of the aisle   from Chicago s Democratic Mayor Rahm Emanuel to Michigan s Republican Gov. Rick Snyder   disregard the will of the people they were elected to represent and abdicate their responsibility to protect them. I ve watched as our system criminalizes blackness while allowing Wall Street to bilk the American people with impunity. Sanders has met with quit a few family members of family members of high-profile victims of anti-black state violence. After taking a tour of the neighborhood Freddie Gray lived in, Sanders was disturbed, if unsurprised, by the deplorable economic conditions that people survive in. Anyone who took the walk that we took around this neighborhood would not think you are in a wealthy nation. You would think you are in a third world country,  Sanders said after the tour.Then of course, there is the chance meeting with the mother and sister of Sandra Bland that occurred, and was not initially reported to the media, where Sanders promised to keep saying Bland s name. Sanders was the only candidate to say her name during the first Democratic debate. The lawyer for Walter Scott s family publicly endorsed Sanders.In her endorsement, Garner lays out who she think s will be the best candidate to serve black people, by saying: Who will address the criminalization of our people? Who understands that we re experiencing an economic crisis made worse by structural barriers to jobs and education? Who will bring us closer to real safety, freedom and power? Who has clearly shown us where they stand?The answer is someone who started this work well before campaign season, who understands our deaths as tragedies   not political talking points   and someone who will speak out against the wars being waged against our communities. Not someone who only pays attention to our concerns when it s time to collect our votes. Not someone who gives us bread crumbs and expects us to be full.Black Americans   all Americans   need a leader with a record that speaks for itself. And to me, it s clear. Of all the presidential candidates, Sen. Bernie Sanders is our strongest ally. Earlier in January, Eric Garner s mother, Gwen Carr, endorsed Hillary Clinton. Her endorsement was put our in the form of a press release by the Clinton campaign. In the press release, Carr writes: Hillary seems to be the only candidate right now who s talking about how we can be strategic in trying to solve this problem. That s why I m endorsing her for president. In contrast, Garner sees Sanders as similar to President Obama. She writes that President Obama was decried as being too extreme and too inexperienced. I remember another candidate who dared me to believe in hope and change. His opponents said he wasn t ready for leadership. They said he couldn t win. He said, Yes, we can.  And we did. I still believe we can. That s why I endorse Bernie Sanders for president. There has been a stark generational divide between Clinton and Sanders supporters, this divide between two different members of the Garner family fits that pattern and shouldn t shock anyone. Both candidates have had some trouble when it comes to racial justice issues. Sanders has had trouble recognizing the non-economic ways that violence is inflicted on people of color. Clinton, (somewhat unfairly) has had to distance herself between the policies that her husband, former president Bill Clinton, ushered in in the 1990 s. Those policies led to the dismantlement of welfare as it was known, and in some ways helped create our current era of mass incarceration. Both candidates have  put out criminal justice reform packages. Here is Clinton s and here is Sanders .For some, the idea that anyone who works within the current political system will truly be an ally for people of color may be seen as wishful thinking. The politics of any movement that built on a collection of diasporic communities can be hard to nail down. Black Lives Matter is no different. But one thing is for sure, for many the  black vote  is no longer a guarantee for the Democratic Party.  That isn t to say that people of color are jumping ship to vote for Republicans. However, with snake people, especially those in more radical activist communities, you have to earn people s votes, and support.  Garner feels that Sanders has earned the title of being people of color s  strongest ally.  That status has a lot to do with Sanders  reaction to criticism of his racial justice package.Whether that proves to be true or not, only time will tell. Regardless of who is the eventual nominee, the public must continue to work towards pushing candidates to do more than pay lip service to traditionally marginalized communities. Change does not always come easy, but it does come when people remain persistent that their communities matter.

BREAKING: Obama Nominates Liberal Merrick Garland For Supreme Court Justice,"Obama decides to nominate Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court even though the Senate announced they would wait until a new administration to confirm a nominee. This is an attempt to box in the Republicans in the Senate. This nominee is left on some things and right on others like criminal justice but has been supported in the past as a judge who  will articulate a broad progressive vision for the law . This should be interesting: To be clear, Garland s record does not suggest that he would join the Court s right flank if confirmed to the Supreme Court. He would likely vote much more often than not with the Supreme Court s liberals. Here s the skinny on left leaning Garland:Garland is unquestionably qualified to sit on the Supreme Court. A 19 year veteran of the DC Circuit   a court that is widely viewed as the second-most powerful in the nation   Garland graduated with high honors from Harvard Law School. He clerked for Justice William Brennan, and spent a few years as a partner in the multinational law firm Arnold and Porter. He also held senior positions in the Justice Department, including a leadership role in the department s criminal division and a stint as Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General.At age 63, Garland is also the oldest person nominated to the Supreme Court since President Nixon named Justice Lewis Powell in 1971. Thus, if confirmed, Garland is unlikely to match   or even approach   Justice Scalia s nearly 30 years on the Supreme Court. Garland s relatively advanced age may help explain why Hatch floated the DC Circuit chief judge as his ideal Obama nominee. Another factor that almost certainly played a role is Garland s reputation for moderation. In 2003, for example, Garland joined an opinion holding that the federal judiciary lacks the authority  to assert habeas corpus jurisdiction at the behest of an alien held at a military base leased from another nation, a military base outside the sovereignty of the United States    an opinion that effectively prohibited Guantanamo Bay detainees from seeking relief in civilian courts. A little over a year later, the Supreme Court reversed this decision in Rasul v. Bush. Although, in fairness, it should be noted that legal experts disagree about whether the decision Garland joined was mandated by existing precedents. The former prosecutor also has a relatively conservative record on criminal justice. A 2010 examination of his decisions by SCOTUS Blog s Tom Goldstein determined that  Judge Garland rarely votes in favor of criminal defendants  appeals of their convictions.  Goldstein  identified only eight such published rulings,  in addition to seven where  he voted to reverse the defendant s sentence in whole or in part, or to permit the defendant to raise a argument relating to sentencing on remand,  during the 13 years Garland had then spent on the DC Circuit. To be clear, Garland s record does not suggest that he would join the Court s right flank if confirmed to the Supreme Court. He would likely vote much more often than not with the Supreme Court s liberals.Read more: Think Progress",Government News,"Mar 16, 2016",3110
 Watch Out NRA: President Obama Is Coming For You,"Where Congress isn t acting on gun reform, President Obama is doing whatever he can. He knows that the ever-present epidemic of gun violence in the United States isn t going to go away on its own, and it s not going to go away by adding more and more guns to the mix either. Common sense actions need to be taken, and that s exactly what the president is offering   NRA be damned.The president wrote Friday in a Facebook post: Today, I want to update you on some important progress we ve made to protect our communities from gun violence. As I said in January, these commonsense steps are not going to prevent every tragedy, but what if they prevented even one? We should be doing everything we can to save lives and spare families the pain and unimaginable loss too many Americans have endured.First, we ve jumpstarted the development of smart gun technology. Today, many gun injuries and deaths are the result of legal guns that were stolen, misused, or discharged accidentally. As long as we ve got the technology to prevent a criminal from stealing and using your smartphone, then we should be able to prevent the wrong person from pulling a trigger on a gun. So, my Administration released a plan today to expedite the development of smart gun technology, including by identifying the requirements that smart guns would have to meet in order for law enforcement to purchase and use them effectively   and keep themselves and the public safer in the process.Second, we re doing more to make sure that those who are already prohibited from obtaining a firearm can t get their hands on one. Today, we re announcing a rule to ensure that federal mental health records about individuals prohibited from buying a gun are reported to the background check system.Third, the White House will convene state and local elected officials from all 50 states in May to discuss their efforts to prevent gun violence through legislative and executive actions. The goal is to figure out what works on the ground when it comes to keeping our communities safe, and then share those practices.As long as I m your president, I will do everything in my power to make our communities safer and keep guns out of the wrong hands. That includes calling on Congress to pass the kinds of commonsense reforms supported by the vast majority of the American people.Making progress on these issues is how we honor the lives that have been lost by gun violence, and it s how we leave behind a stronger, more secure nation for our children. The initiative President Obama announced was just put on the White House blog in great detail, which can be found HERE.The president laid out his hope for smart guns back in January as well: Of course, though, the NRA is already fear-baiting their followers and getting people to be afraid of any changes that my take place..@POTUS' new #guncontrol push is ""alarming cops who say they don t want to be guinea pigs."" https://t.co/Auoo6o77wu #2A  NRA (@NRA) April 28, 2016And while the police have every right to be apprehensive, it s important to remember that something, anything, needs to be done to help push forth the effort for a safer United States. Promoting safer guns is an idea that should be embraced by all, and you d think any group, like the NRA, who says they re for  responsible gun ownership  would embrace an idea that made gun ownership more responsible.Within the same Politico article that the NRA tweeted out, it states: [Smart gun technology] wouldn t prevent most mass shootings, gun crimes or suicides   currently the biggest driver of gun deaths. However, they could cut down on the roughly 500 deaths each year from accidental shootings, especially by kids. Advocates also point to findings that most youth suicides are committed with a parents  weapon, and instances where officers  own guns are stolen in a scuffle and used to shoot them cause about 1 in 10 police deaths. It s important to note that this technology probably could have happened a long time ago had it not been for possible political backlash. The gun lobby currently owns several members of Congress, which is truly the biggest obstacle to getting common sense gun reform passed.What President Obama has put forth isn t an attack on guns, it s not an attack on gun owners, and it s not going to limit any rights of those who do and should be able to own guns. What it does is put forth measures to make guns safer, less accessible to those who shouldn t have them, and start a national conversation.The president is taking on the NRA and doesn t really care what they have to say, because all they care about is profit for their gun manufacturer buddies. Something needs to happen, and it needs to happen sooner rather than later.Featured Photo by Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images",News,"April 29, 2016",4789
 Rudy Giuliani Gives The Most INSANE Reason Why Trump Isn’t A Racist (VIDEO),"The All Lives Matter movement may have just found its new spokesperson. On Wednesday morning, Rudy Giuliani gave everyone who denies racism more reason to be loud in their cause to ignore social justice issues. And unfortunately, Giuliani s words were meant to defend the most racist American of all.The former mayor of New York City went on MSNBC earlier today to argue that Trump couldn t be racist, even though Trump has been supported by white supremacists all over the country and has an ever-growing history of racist behavior. But not only did Giuliani say that Trump is not a racist, he said that NO ONE is a racist   pretty much solidifying that he should never be in any position of power considering he does not understand the current state of America or the basic human rights issues that many Americans are facing today. Giuliani said: Racist? The last thing in the world Donald Trump is is a racist. I ve known him for 28 years. The man likes white people. He likes black people. He likes Hispanic people. He plays golf with them. Giuliani has obviously forgotten the time that Trump called Mexican immigrants drug dealers, immigrants and rapists, or the fact that Trump wouldn t rent apartments to black people in the past   among several other racist things Trump has done over his lifetime. But it gets worse. In an astounding, baffling display of white privilege, Giuliani argued that racism wasn t actually a thing. To say that Donald Trump is a racist is outrageous, and to call anyone a racist is outrageous Then, Giuliani railed against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for talking about racism in America and actually treating it as the serious issue that it is. He said: If she thinks we all have implicit bias, Hillary, I got news for you: I don t. Maybe you do. I have no racial guilt. Not a single bit of it. Which is why I m willing to tell the truth about black crime and what has to be done about it. Truly, it s enough to make your brain hurt.

RED FLAG IN CLINTON’S FBI INTERVIEW Shocks Former Prosecutor Andrew McCarthy,"Finally, something else about those lawyers. I nearly fell out of my chair upon reading the very first paragraph of the notes of Clinton s interview, which identifies the lawyers for Clinton who were permitted to be present for the interview. Among them is Cheryl Mills, Clinton s longtime confidant and chief-of-staff at the State Department.Readers may recall that I suggested back in May that  the fix  was in in the investigation of the Clinton emails. The reason was that the Justice Department was allowing Cheryl Mills   a witness, if not a subject, of the investigation   to invoke attorney-client privilege on behalf of Mrs. Clinton in order to thwart the FBI s attempt to inquire into the procedure used to produce Clinton s emails to the State Department. Mills was a participant in that procedure   and it is the procedure in which, we now know, well over 30,000 emails were attempted to be destroyed, including several thousand that contained government-related business.When she worked for Clinton at State, Mills was not acting in the capacity of a lawyer   not for then-Secretary Clinton and not for the State Department. Moreover, as Clinton s chief-of-staff, Mills was intimately involved in issues related to Clinton s private email set up, the discussions about getting her a secure BlackBerry similar to President Obama s, and questions that were raised (including in FOIA requests) about Clinton s communications.That is to say, Mills was an actor in the facts that were under criminal investigation by the FBI. Put aside that she was not Mrs. Clinton s lawyer while working for the State Department; as I explained in the May column, Mills, after leaving the State Department, was barred by ethical rules from acting as Mrs. Clinton s lawyer  in connection with a matter in which the lawyer participated personally and substantially as a public officer or employee. There is no way Mills should have been permitted to participate as a lawyer in the process of producing Clinton s emails to the State Department nearly two years after they d both left.I thought it was astonishing that the Justice Department indulged her attorney-client privilege claim, which frustrated the FBI s ability to question her on a key aspect of the investigation. But it is simply unbelievable to find her turning up at Mrs. Clinton s interview   participating in the capacity of a lawyer under circumstances where Clinton was being investigated over matters in which Mills participated as a non-lawyer government official.FLASHBACK: REMEMBER WHEN CHERYL MILLS WALKED OUT OF FBI MEETING: Read more: NRO",politics,"Sep 3, 2016",2604
HILLARY CLINTON CRASHING IN POLLS: Moves To Obama Strategy…Using Taxpayer Money To Give Away Free Sh*T,"So, the working people of America are basically supposed to sit back and watch Bernie Sanders and Hillary compete to see who can pander to get more votes by promising Americans and illegal aliens more free sh*t with our hard earned money? Like healthcare, education is a sclerotic, overexpensive, underperforming industry. Both have strong parallels: they re dominated by government subsidies and controls, though not entirely socialized; they re perhaps the only growth industries in our moribund economy; and they dominate the thought life of the nation. As Arnold Kling and Nick Schulz pointed out in 2011:These are our foremost growth sectors   the ones most central to employment and consumption; the ones that, increasingly, drive our economy. And it is in precisely these two sectors that the case for extensive government intervention and planning, if not outright control, is dominant   and becoming ever more so.If there is to be any hope of reversing this trend, champions of market economics must come to see these two sectors as the front lines in the battle for capitalism. At stake is not only an ideological or theoretical point, but also American prosperity. The historical record makes this clear: In the nations where it was practiced, government control of the old commanding heights of the economy made those industries less efficient and less innovative   bringing overall economic performance down with them.Today, Hillary Clinton is touting her plan for Obamacare-izing higher education. Competing Democratic presidential candidates Martin O Malley and Bernie Sanders have already proposed essentially socializing college straight up. Clinton s proposal, like Obamacare, is also collectivist and unjustified wealth redistribution, but with a more complicated, less direct, crony capitalist flavor. In other words, it s not direct socialism, but it might as well be.By mucking around this way, Clinton gains the benefit of deception: She can argue that  both the left and the right  (by  right,  she of course means the craziest of Republicans, not actual conservatives) have proposed elements of her plan. So she gets to smear her Frankenstein with pretty  bipartisan  makeup. And the average voter won t care, because the average voter doesn t give jack about enslaving his children (or other people s children) to the unseen but growing monstrosity of federal debt, as long as he gets feel-goodies now, regardless of whether they actually benefit anyone. But it s still a Frankenstein.What Does Hillary Clinton Propose, Exactly? Before we get into the mud-slinging, let s do what most journalists do not and give some actual hard facts about Clinton s proposal. (Do any of you also scan news articles looking for actual facts instead of paid spokespeople s lying spin? It s hard to find those, isn t it?) The full proposal doesn t seem available (probably so they can tweak its details in response to initial criticism); reporters have gotten  three fact sheets,  MSNBC says. Inside Higher Ed kindly posted them. A news summary of the major points: Under the plan, which was outlined by Clinton advisers on Sunday, about $175 billion in grants would go to states that guarantee students would not have to take out loans to cover tuition at four-year public colleges and universities. In return for the money, states would have to end budget cuts to increase spending over time on higher education, while also working to slow the growth of tuition, thought the plan does not require states to cap it.  (NYT) military veterans, lower-income students and those who complete a national service program, like AmeriCorps, would go to school for free in the Clinton plan  (AP). She would also expand income-based repayment programs, allowing every student borrower to enroll in a plan that would cap their payments at 10 percent of their income with remaining debt forgiven after 20 years.  (AP) Student borrowers would be expected to work at least 10 hours a week to contribute, while their families would continue contributing under the current income-based model. Clinton s plan would also expand a tax credit from $1,000 to $2,500 for families paying for college.  (MSNBC) Her campaign says she will create a dedicated fund for Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and will expand AmeriCorps from 75,000 to 250,000 members.  (MSNBC) Mrs. Clinton would pay for the [supposedly $350 billion] plan by capping the value of itemized deductions that wealthy families can take on their tax returns.  (NYT)So more income redistribution and more federal micromanagement because, clearly, central planners know better how to manage college costs than colleges and families. Topped off, of course, by (what else?) playing self-appointed Robin Hood against people who earn lots less money than she does. Envy and greed are our society s favorite sins, after all.Federal Meddling Is the Problem, Not the AnswerThe most expensive portion of Clinton s proposal involves bullying states into following federal marching orders in order for them to receive cash the feds scooped from taxpayers.For entire story: The Federalist",left-news,"Aug 10, 2015",5140
 Michigan Militia Group Turns On Right-Wing Governor Rick Snyder,"As a general rule, militia groups do not side with liberals on anything. But as Michigan reels under revelations of conspiracy and collusion at all levels of republican Governor Rick Snyder s administration, militia members have added their voice to the chorus of citizens calling for Snyder s arrest.As reported by the Detroit Free Press, the Genesee County Volunteer Militia will be staging a protest in the city of Flint, demanding answers from state officials regarding the city s poisoned water. The protest will be held on January 23, just one week after filmmaker and activist Michael Moore staged a similar protest in the city.In a press release concerning the upcoming protest, the Genesee County Volunteer Militia stated: It is nothing less than shocking that our elected officials would try to hide the hazards that residents are being subjected to just by drinking a simple glass of tap water!!! On its Facebook page, the militia group has also issued a call for the state s emergency manager law to be overturned by the Michigan legislature. This echoes the sentiments of an overwhelming majority of Michigan citizens, many who voted to repeal the law in 2012.Following the voter repeal, the state legislature, which is almost entirely controlled by republican and Tea Party representatives, simply rewrote the emergency manager law and passed it again, this time with a rider to ensure it could not be repealed by voters.Image: scree capture, Genesee County Volunteer Militia, *names redactedLike other militia groups around the state, the Genesee County Volunteer militia displays the Tea Party flag on their Facebook page.This week it was widely reported that Governor Snyder has hired two out-of-state PR firms to try to help him with his public image.No doubt Snyder was hoping to paint the Flint water scandal as a  leftist  attack. The trouble with that narrative is that Michigan militia members are the furthest thing from  leftist  as you can get.When the pro-gun militia stands shoulder to shoulder with the producer of the anti-gun documentary  Bowling for Columbine,  you ve got the kind of problems not even two hundred PR firms can fix.Dave McKellar, a member of the Genesee militia group, told the Detroit Free Press that the group not only agrees with Michael Moore, but that they are trying to coordinate protests with the filmmaker, so that they do not stop.To be clear, we re not saying that we think the militia should bring out their weapons and march through the streets of Flint. To be clear, there hasn t been any indication that Sunday s protest will be an armed protest.Still it is very significant that even far-right groups like the Volunteer militia, which have consistently voted for and defended Michigan s republican/Tea Party legislature, are now turning against the people they helped put in office.Image credit: screen capture Genesee County Volunteer Militia",News,"January 23, 2016",2908

 WATCH: Trump Campaign Manager Blames Women For Rape,"Once again, a Republican rape comment surfaces, and it s from the campaign manager of the Republican nominee.Donald Trump s campaign has been full of sexism and misogyny, so it was only a matter of time before his third campaign manager Kellyanne Conway made her own offensive comment about rape.In 2013, despite Republicans being advised to keep their mouths shut about women and rape, Conway appeared in a panel discussion to talk about women in the military. At some point, Conway used rape as an analogy even though rape was not part of the discussion.Conway blamed women for being raped because they are not as physically strong as men and that  rape would not exist  if only women were not so weak. If we were physiologically   not mentally, emotionally, professionally   equal to men, if we were physiologically as strong as men, rape would not exist,  Conway said.  You would be able to defend yourself and fight him off. Here s the video via YouTube. Conway s rape comment is at the 2 minute mark.Conway s comment assumes that all rapes can be prevented simply by being physically strong. Unfortunately, rapists have many tricks to incapacitate their victims, including date rape drugs. Being strong also does not work very well if a rapist has their victim at knifepoint or gunpoint.Instead of blaming rapists, Conway openly blamed women for rape. She was a Republican pollster at the time, but now she is the campaign manager for the presidential candidate of the Republican Party.Clearly, Trump either did not vet Conway at all or he is okay with what she had to say about rape.But this adds to the pattern of Republicans blaming the victim instead of the rapist. For years, Republicans have been saying outrageous things about rape. Here s 40 of them.Trump is just another Republican in a long line of Republicans who apparently believe women are at fault if they get raped. His hiring of Conway clearly demonstrates that. They seem to think it s acceptable to blame rape victims for their assaults, deny women the right to control their own health care, and downplay sexual harassment in the workplace,  Daily Show creator Liz Winstead responded to Conway s remarks.  It s not. Featured image via screen capture",News,"August 31, 2016",2225

Cotton is known these days as  Tehran Tom  thanks to his poorly executed attempt to derail President Obama s nuclear agreement with Iran by organizing a secret letter that was sent to the Iranian government instructing the country to ignore the diplomatic agreement or else, so it s a little rich that he feels confident in lecturing another senator on  leadership. However, it s not just Cotton s shameless hypocrisy that is striking, but the apparently fully realized fantasy world he lives in. So powerful are the delusions and so blind is he to the real world, it s a wonder Cotton manages to walk through his office without bumping into a coffee table. Here s Cotton, a man who recently held up a crucial bill because it would have allowed the Iranian nuclear agreement to go forward, slamming Sen. Harry Reid for   don t laugh, this is serious   obstructing a defense bill. As a junior senator, I preside over the Senate. I usually do in the morning, which means I m forced to listen to the bitter, vulgar, incoherent ramblings of the Minority Leader,  Cotton said.  Normally, like other Americans, I ignore them. I can t ignore them today, however. Cotton tore into Reid for stalling a vote on a crucial defense bill, even though the bill eventually passed 98-0.  When was the last time the Minority Leader read a bill? It was probably an electricity bill,  Cotton quipped.Why was Reid holding up the bill? For one thing, Republicans decided to add an amendment that would allow religious organizations to legally discriminate against gay people (in defiance of federal law). It s a favorite pet project of the GOP and, you may have noticed, has absolutely nothing to do with funding the military. Reid may be forgiven for feeling like amendments like these are unfettered bullshit and intentionally placed in important defense bills so that people like Tom Cotton can grandstand about them.Ironically, another aspect of the defense bill that has led to controversy is amendment requiring women to register for the draft. Why is that in there? Well, it s a funny story.The move to require women to register for the draft had an unlikely origin, when Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.)   who opposes the Obama administration s recent decision to open up all combat roles to women   proposed the change in the House Armed Services Committee to start a  discussion.  But to GOP leaders  surprise, the committee approved his language, prompting them to yank out the provision in a Rules Committee maneuver before it could go to the floor.In other words, Republicans in both the House and Senate have worked overtime to shoot themselves in the foot then scream at Democrats for not providing them with bulletproof shoes.It s clear what going on here. The Republican-led Congress has bravely led Congress to its lowest approval numbers in history. It s function as an equal branch of government has been replaced by a level of gridlock so severe that almost nothing gets accomplished. Having gotten Congress to this point by obstruction, Republicans are eager to diffuse the blame by pretending  both sides  do it.In Cotton s hysterical screeching, there s a very real fear that nobody is buying it anymore. Even someone as delusional as him can see that.Watch Cotton s ravings below via C-SPAN:Featured image via YouTube",News,"May 25, 2016",3446
"ELECTION FRAUD: If It Happened in Michigan, Will It Happen in Ohio?","21st Century Wire says On a recent episode of The Sunday Wire with Patrick Henningsen, guest Basil Valentine asked Patrick for his analysis on the Bernie Sanders vs. Hillary Clinton primary race, and what ensued was a poignant discussion about a deeper issue   voter and election fraud.PH: It s a tight race. Hillary has the edge on the super delegates, which is the most corrupt, un-democratic aspect of the Democratic Party. BV: I m not sure it s it s very un-democratic and corrupt, I agree. But I don t think it s the most corrupt. The most corrupt is the vote fraud. Basil cites a new report about the recent Michigan Presidential Primary, where its findings suggest that Bernie Sanders actually did better than the recorded vote share indicates.The author of the report, Richard Charnin, provides context not only for Michigan primary results but for Massachusetts results as well:This analysis indicates that Sanders did much better than his recorded vote in the Michigan primary. Sanders had 590,386 votes (49.8%) and Clinton 570,948 (48.3%). Sanders won in 73 of 83 MI counties with 56% of the vote. He won the preliminary exit poll by 52.1-45.9%, a 97% win probability. Clinton won urban counties Wayne and Oakland with approximately 55% of the vote.Clinton won the Massachusetts primary by just 1.4%, but she did well in urban areas. Sanders won hand-counted precincts by 57-40% in 68 Towns (32,360 votes, 2.7% of votes cast). Sanders also had 52.1% in the preliminary exit poll which he won by 52.1-45.7%. His win probability was also 97%.(See Charnin s full report and statistical analysis here, including a breakdown of voting machine totals.)Charnin explains there are three key indicators to track in determining whether election fraud has occurred:  cumulative vote shares, preliminary exit poll, absentee vote anomalies Of course, you will not hear much about election fraud from the media   their coverage focuses solely on the recorded vote at the end of the night, and the usual Poli-tricks and Propaganda  mess with voters  minds during their televised election coverage.Will we see these same election fraud indicators in the Florida, Ohio, Illinois, Missouri and North Carolina primaries?READ MORE 2016 NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Election Files",US_News,"March 15, 2016",2273
 RNC Spokesman Hilariously Ridiculed After Invoking ‘My Little Pony’ Defense Of Melania (SCREENSHOTS/VIDEO),"Sometimes, politics can get so ridiculous that one is forced to wonder if what he or she is seeing is really happening. One of those moments occurred on the second day of the GOP convention. After Melania Trump blatantly plagiarized part of Michelle Obama s 2008 Democratic convention speech, the GOP leaped into action, offering every ridiculous excuse they could muster to defend the prospective next First Lady   including the Trump campaign s official hamburger delivery boy Chris Christie s  well-she-didn t-plagiarize-all-of-it-so-it-wasn t-plagiarism  defense.But the most insane thing to come out of this scenario is perhaps Republican National Committee communications director Sean Spicer s  My Little Pony  defense. Melania Trump said,  You work hard for what you want in life.  Akon said,  Work hard for what you get in life.  John Legend said,  Work hard,  Spicer offered during an interview on MSNBC. You re quoting Akon and John Legend?  asked host Craig Melvin. Hold on, it s getting better,  Spicer continued. And he was right   it did get better: Melania Trump said,  The strength of your dreams and your willingness to work for them.  Twilight Sparkle from  My Little Pony  said,  This is your dream, anything you can do in your dreams. A simple Google search of three phrases comes up with everything from Sparkle Pony to John Legend to Akon,  Spicer said, ignoring that an entire paragraph was quoted by Mrs. Trump nearly word-for-word.Naturally, the internet had a lot of fun with this:A presidential campaign quoting from MY LITTLE PONY.

He s not, but let s pretend that this is some alternate universe where rabid, tentacular beasts rule the planet, the sky is constantly on fire, and a smart, classy woman like Michelle Obama needs to dip into the brilliant and thought-provoking scripts of  My Little Pony  in order to write a speech.Does it really make it any better that Melania Trump lifted quotes third-hand from a children s TV show? Is the fact that Mrs. Trump couldn t steal from someone more respectable than a show about magic horses actually comforting?Here s the thing, though. While Spicer really  had to reach to connect Trump s (and Obama s) to My Little Pony, the difference in wording between the two speeches was minimal.

 WATCH: Lewis Black Hilariously BURNS Trump And Mocks Inauguration On The Daily Show,"If Lewis Black really does have a ticket to the inauguration, Donald Trump is probably trying to revoke it right now.Because during Wednesday night s Daily Show, the comedian roasted Trump, taking particular aim at Trump s inauguration problems.For weeks, Trump and his team have been desperately trying to find an A-list celebrity to perform at the inauguration. For the most part, Trump has failed, so he has resorted to hiring a reality show contestant and a has-been band, while forcing the Radio City Rockettes to perform because they can be fired for saying no.Black informed Trump that if he wants to know why many celebrities died in 2016, it s because they didn t want to perform at the inauguration either. You want to know why so many celebrities died in 2016? It was to get out of playing the goddamn inauguration,  Black quipped.Then Black pointed out that Trump is pretending he doesn t really care if A-list celebrities show up, even going so far as to claim that he s the one who rejected them and not the other way around.The so-called  A  list celebrities are all wanting tixs to the inauguration, but look what they did for Hillary, NOTHING. I want the PEOPLE!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 23, 2016Black was able to get a ticket, however, and he intends to show up on Friday whether Trump likes it or not. I ve got my tickets, and I m going to go no matter what,  Black said.  Because I want to be there when Trump touches the Bible and his hand catches on fire. Black went on to break the news to Trump that even Richard Nixon was able to land A-list talent for his inaugural ceremony by getting legendary entertainer James Brown to sing. All Trump has been able to get so far is Jackie Evancho, who didn t even win America s Got Talent.To make matters worse, Trump s team literally humiliated themselves by bragging about the participation of the Caisson Platoon and the famous army horse Black Jack. The problem is that Black Jack has been dead since 1976. Trump is  tweeting a dead horse,  Black quipped.Black then revealed Trump s inauguration them is  soft sensuality  which Black says is good because at least Trump is going to f*ck America  gently.

 Trump’s Ego Goes Into Overdrive As He Retweets Anyone Who Kisses His A** Over Withdrawal From Paris Climate Accord,"Donald Trump is so desperate to hear praise that he is retweeting anyone who congratulates him for withdrawing the United States from the Paris climate deal.In an effort to prevent and reverse climate change, the developing nations of the world came together in Paris, France and agreed to curb their carbon emissions.Trump, however, is a climate change denier. So he promised to pull America out of the deal and he did exactly that on Thursday. In order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its citizens, the United States will withdraw from the Paris climate accord,  Trump announced.  We re getting out. And then he referred to himself in the third person and patted himself on the back. The Paris accord is a bad deal for Americans and the President s action today is keeping his campaign promise to put America first. The accord was negotiated poorly by the Obama administration out of desperation. Trump s decision has spurred outrage across the nation and around the globe as world leaders feel that the United States has betrayed them. One of the big reasons why the Paris Agreement became reality is because the United States led the way. Now America is retreating from that leadership role.However, Trump was only interested in hearing praise for his monumentally moronic decision, so he proceeded to retweet anyone who kissed his ass, including Lindsey Graham, Reince Priebus, and Kevin McCarthy.I support President Trump s desire to re-enter the Paris Accord after the agreement becomes a better deal for America and business.

 Donald Trump Loses His Sh*t In Massive Hissy Fit About The Media Doing Their Job (TWEETS),"Donald Trump is whining about the media doing their job, so can someone please get out the world s smallest violin and play it just for him?Rather than blame his campaign woes on himself and the pathetic staff he has assembled, the Republican nominee has chosen to target the media as the sole reason why his run for president is imploding.Trump has created a hostile atmosphere for members of the media during his rallies, especially during a December rally when the Secret Service literally had to step in to protect NBC reporter Katy Tur after Trump targeted her specifically. The crowd booed and hissed at the media on Saturday as well as Trump complained that the media is somehow treating him unfairly because they report on what he says.As usual, Trump to his temper tantrums in real world to Twitter, where he fired off several tweets on Sunday morning and afternoon all about how the  dishonest  media is in the bag for Hillary Clinton.The failing @nytimes talks about anonymous sources and meetings that never happened.

This is the same man whom Newt Gingrich outrageously compared to Harry Truman, the president who famously declared that the  buck stops here,  which means the ultimate burden of responsibility is on the guy in charge.

 Dave Chappelle: ‘I F***ed Up’ When Asking To Give Trump A Chance (DETAILS),"Comedian Dave Chappelle, known for his razor-sharp and hilarious views on race in America, is officially apologizing for asking America to give Trump a chance.Chappelle asked people to give Trump some time to settle into his role as President before judging him last year, during a monologue on Saturday Night Live that aired a few days after the election. But in a set the comedian performed at Caroline s in New York, he told the audience that he regrets what he said.Chappelle got right to the point with his apology, saying  I was the first guy on TV to say  Give Trump a chance.  I fucked up. Sorry.  That time when Dave Chappelle apologized for asking us to give Trump a chance  The self-proclaimed ""Jane Goodall"" of white people now has this to say about Trump's instability, the Muslim ban, and what a black presidency was expected to look like ??? #davechappelle #nyc @robinhoodnycA post shared by Caroline NYC (@caroline_newyork) on May 15, 2017 at 11:26pm PDTHe went on to deliver a strong set that touched on exactly why he was wrong. Chappelle said,  Every day you wake up and you never know what [Trump] is going to do next. The comedian also touched on Trump s racism and Islamophobia, bringing up the President s failed Muslim ban,  Donald Trump said we shouldn t let any Muslims into the United States  until we can figure out what s going on.  And I think that s way out of step with the way people feel in America. At the time, his SNL monologue got some pushback from media critics who argued that giving Trump a chance to be Presidential, after spending most of his campaign behaving badly, was misguided.Chappelle couched his call for tolerance with a plea for Trump to return the favor, saying at the time,  I m wishing Donald Trump luck. And I m going to give him a chance, and we, the historically disenfranchised, demand that he give us one too. But clearly Chappelle doesn t feel like Trump has held up his end of the bargain, and it s hard to disagree with that sentiment.",News,"May 16, 2017",2000
 What Ted Cruz Said In Church Sounds Like Sharia Law For America (VIDEO),"Presidential candidate Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) visited a South Carolina church on Sunday and in a message broadcast to several other houses of worship, made an argument for a government based on the principles of the religious far right, rather than the American Constitution.Echoing Middle Eastern extremists who believe that the law of God trumps existing laws, Cruz told the crowd what they wanted to hear about where a candidate like himself would take America.Cruz, an avowed evangelical, made his case in front of a packed house of nearly 2,000 churchgoers.His sermon, titled  Faith in Action,  pressed a range of conservative hot buttons, from religious liberty to abortion rights to the Second Amendment.Cruz warned that a  radical   left-wing majority  on the Supreme Court could result in  unlimited abortions on demand across this country   with taxpayer funding and no parental notification. He called the high court s decision to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide  fundamentally illegitimate, lawless, unconstitutional and wrong. Cruz has previously demonstrated that he believes religious faith trumps the law of the land, with his support for rogue clerk Kim Davis in Kentucky. Cruz was among the woman s most vocal supporters as she refused to grant marriage certificates for same-sex couples, even after the Supreme Court had ruled that same-sex marriages were legal in all fifty states and the District of Columbia.Over his campaign, Cruz has tried to appeal to the faction of conservative Republican voters who have a view of the role of government that is similar to Middle Eastern  sharia,  where religious texts and beliefs have more sway than the written rule of law. Cruz found success, when those voters backed him in the Iowa caucus and led to victory for his campaign. He had a setback with New Hampshire s less religious and more independent primary voters, where he finished in third place. Cruz is hoping that more religious extremist voters in South Carolina will allow him to regain the momentum he may have lost.Featured image via YouTube",News,"February 15, 2016",2075
 WATCH: Even Investigation-Obsessed GOP Rep. Jason Chaffetz Says Trump Has No Proof Obama Wiretapped Him,"Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz has made a living in Congress starting investigations into just about anything in an effort to hurt Democrats. But even he thinks Donald Trump has nothing to support his accusations against President Obama.On Saturday, Trump made the outrageous claim that President Obama wiretapped Trump Tower to spy on him and demanded that Congress investigate even though he didn t offer a single shred of evidence to back up his claims.Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my  wires tapped  in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017Trump s accusations were even shot down by former National Intelligence Director James Clapper, who served in the position from 2010 to 2017.Clapper told Meet The Press on Sunday that if President Obama had ordered a wiretap, whether legal or illegal, he would have known about it.Of course, that s not stopping Republicans from including Trump s accusations in their investigation of his Russia scandal, which means we can expect Republicans to focus more of their energy trying to desperately prove Trump s claim than they will on revealing Trump s ties to Russia and Vladimir Putin.But one Republican concedes that he hasn t seen anything that would support Trump s accusation.Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz loves investigations. He is obsessed with witch hunts against Democrats and will start endless investigations into anything if he thinks it could be a scandal to hit Democrats with. On the other hand, he isn t really interested in investigating Republicans like Trump when true scandals like Russian interference in the election arise. But even he says that Trump has nothing to prove his accusations against President Obama. You never know when you turn a corner what you may or may not see,  Chaffetz said on CBS This Morning. But thus far I have not seen anything directly that would support what the president has said. Despite that concession, Chaffetz has offered to support an investigation into Trump s allegations even though he isn t interested in leading the investigation himself. Look, it s a very serious allegation,  Chaffetz continued.  The president has at his fingertips tens of billions of dollars in intelligence apparatus. I ve got to believe   I think he might have something there, but if not, we re going to find out. Here s the video via YouTube:So Chaffetz literally went from saying that Trump has nothing to saying that he might have something. This is the kind of double-speak that Americans despise from politicians.The fact is that Trump has zero evidence to support his claims and Congress has no evidence to justify starting an investigation based on those claims. Trump is slandering President Obama based on a conspiracy theory he read on Breitbart and Republicans appear to be willing to start a witch hunt over it. And American taxpayers will be paying for it.Donald Trump is hoping to distract Congress from investigating his Russia scandal by telling lies about President Obama. It s sad that Republicans are incapable of seeing through Trump s bullshit. As usual, Republicans are demonstrating that they would rather investigate Democrats instead of doing anything that threatens their own power.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"March 6, 2017",3328

 Americans TORCH Hypocrite GOP Lawmaker For Using Affordable Care Act To Get Major Surgery Before Leaving Office,"Donald Trump and the Republican Congress are busy trying to shred healthcare for the rest of us, but one Republican lawmaker is using Obamacare to get major surgery before he leaves office.Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz has been outspoken about the Republican effort to kill the Affordable Care Act. He s been salivating at doing so for years. He calls it a failed program that has done nothing but hurt the American people.But while he s busy trying to repeal the landmark healthcare law, he has no problem using it himself.Earlier this month, Chaffetz announced that he would not seek re-election after his current term expires. However, he s going to make sure he sucks as much healthcare out of American taxpayers as he can before he officially leaves.Chaffetz posted a message to Facebook on Wednesday night informing his constituents that he will be getting major surgery on his foot and will be taking the next 3-4 weeks offChaffetz seriously expects us to understand and give a damn about his situation. The problem is that he lacks sympathy and empathy when it comes to ordinary Americans who can t afford such surgeries and the amount of recovery time required.And if Republicans succeed at killing the Affordable Care Act, Americans will be at serious risk of not having health insurance to cover such medical procedures.Chaffetz, on the other hand, is using his gold level health insurance under the Affordable Care Act to cover his surgery. So he is literally using the Affordable Care Act to make sure his healthcare needs are met, and after he has no further use for it he ll vote to kill the law for everyone else.Americans were not happy about this hypocrisy, so they stormed Chaffetz s Twitter page and hammered him for it.@jasoninthehouse And you re going to use this as a teachable moment as to why coverage for pre-existing conditions and paid health leave is important, yes?

Gov. Cuomo Defends Not Endorsing Mayor de Blasio…Speaks Up On ‘Offensive Statues’ Of Christopher Columbus,"NY Governor Andrew Cuomo made two shocking announcements regarding the Christopher Columbus Statues and about his decision not to endorse NY Mayor de Blasio.During an appearance at the West Indian Day Parade on Monday, Gov. Cuomo said statues of the famous Italian explorer should remain in the public square: The Christopher Columbus statue is really about honoring Italian Americans. I for one for obvious reasons happen to believe in the Italian-American heritage. I believe in the contribution Italian-Americans have made, just as I believe in celebrating the Caribbean and the Israel day parade. NO ENDORSEMENT?   A BATTLE ROYAL BETWEEN TWO DEM HEAVYWEIGHTSGov. Andrew Cuomo said he isn t endorsing Mayor Bill de Blasio for re-election   because he lives in Westchester. I don t vote in the primary election. I m a Westchester resident,  he said.  I m not voting in this election, so I don t have any primary endorsements at this time. The Democratic primary is Sept. 12, and de Blasio is heavily favored to win. The mayor endorsed Cuomo months before the Democratic primary in 2014.Cuomo s non-endorsement of de Blasio is just the latest example of sniping between the two Democratic Party power brokers. We didn t ask for his support,  said de Blasio campaign spokeswoman Monica Klein. A FIRESTORM OF CRITICISM If this doesn t sink the mayor s reelection efforts, we don t know what will! When de Blasio announced he would form a committee of people who would decide which statues are  offensive  then take them down, we knew it was going to be a rough go for de Blasio. You don t tell the Italian community to take down Christopher Columbus statues! Cuomo said it best when he finally came out with a statement in support of keeping the statues: The Italian American contribution and the Italian American culture is a big part if what makes New York, New York,  Cuomo said.There have been several protests regarding this move by de Blasio so he s now backtracking on his decision:Mayor de Blasio and Council Speaker Melissa Mark Viverito have come under a firestorm of criticism for mulling the removal of a Christopher Columbus statues   including the 76-foot structure in Columbus Square   as part of a review of offensive monuments. The mayor has backtracked following the outcry. There s no plan to remove the Columbus statue,  said de Blasio spokesman Eric Phillips.While the Italian explorer is revered for discovering the New World, Columbus  detractors said he mistreated and enslaved native Caribbean populations and doesn t deserve to be extolled.CUOMO NEEDED TO FIRST PUT HIS WET FINGER INTO THE WIND TO SEE HOW OPINION WAS GOINGIt s the first time Cuomo has waded in on the controversy after declining comment last week. The sniping has happened before between the aides of both camps:De Blasio, Cuomo aides engage in nasty Twitter feudREAD MORE: NYP",politics,"Sep 4, 2017",2870
 Bundy Militia Fans Continue Threats To Kill Oregon Authorities,"More than two months after Bundy Militia idiot Robert  LaVoy  Finicum was shot and killed during a standoff with federal and state police, authorities say officials are still receiving death threats.According to reports, the police have documented at least 80 threats against various officials okay   including Governor Kate Brown. One Bundy fan club member left a message at the governor s office saying: You killed an unarmed rancher, so now one of you must die. The Seattle Times reports:The governor s office reported Friday that threats related to the standoff and Finicum shooting continue to come in against Brown.One email demanded the release of refuge occupiers jailed on federal charges. It also demanded indictments for the officers involved in Finicum s death. If that doesn t happen, the writer said,  I am going to begin returning fire. Last month, the FBI released video of the shooting that left Finicum dead, and you can clearly see that he was reaching for his weapon when police opened fire. In spite of video evidence that exonerated the officers and proved that the imbecile known as  Tarp Man  was a violent thug, right-wingers insist the shooting was not justified. And to make things right, they want to murder police officers and the governor. That s insane.In addition to the continued death threats, authorities discovered that people hell-bent on retaliation are  aggressively hunting  the names of the officers who were involved in the shooting. This further highlights how important it is to keep those names from the public according to Malheur County District Attorney Dan Norris.Although the governor has said the officers names will eventually be released, it s definitely better that they are kept quiet right now. The people who are making the threats are missing some screws. It doesn t matter how much evidence is put forth that proves their outrage is completely unfounded, they ve made up their minds. Their actions are proof of what constant anti-government rhetoric does to people. And there is one party to blame for that: Republicans.For years, Tea Party Republicans have been spewing hate to their voters and telling them the government wants to hurt them. They do this knowing that the sovereign citizen movement that the Bundy Militia belonged to is one of the biggest threats to law enforcement. So, the next time you hear conservatives saying, Blue lives matter!  Show them this and tell them .Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"March 27, 2016",2486
PRESIDENT TRUMP’S SPEECH: “BELIEVE IN YOURSELF”…”BELIEVE IN AMERICA”,"THE TRANSCRIPT OF PRESIDENT TRUMP S SPEECH TO CONGRESS: THE VIDEOS ARE BELOWMr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and Citizens of America: Tonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History Month, we are reminded of our nation s path toward civil rights and the work that still remains.Recent threats targeting Jewish Community Centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week s shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its forms.Each American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty and justice   in an unbroken chain all the way down to the present. That torch is now in our hands, and we will use it to light up the world.I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.A new chapter of American Greatness is now beginning.A new national pride is sweeping across our nation.And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp.What we are witnessing today is the Renewal of the American Spirit. Our allies will find that America is once again ready to lead.All the nations of the world   friend or foe   will find that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free.In 9 years, The United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our Founding   250 years since the day we declared our Independence.It will be one of the great milestones in the history of the world. But what will America look like as we reach our 250th year? What kind of country will we leave for our children?I will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of our future. For too long, we ve watched our middle class shrink as we ve exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries. We ve financed and built one global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit   and so many other places throughout our land.We ve defended the borders of other nations, while leaving our own borders wide open, for anyone to cross   and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate.And we ve spent trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.Then, in 2016, the earth shifted beneath our feet.The rebellion started as a quiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds   families who just wanted a fair shot for their children, and a fair hearing for their concerns.But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus   as thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country.Finally, the chorus became an earthquake   and the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial demand, that America must put its own citizens first   because only then, can we truly, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. PART 1 OF THE SPEECH: Dying industries will come roaring back to life. Heroic Veterans will get the care they so desperately need.Our military will be given the resources its brave warriors so richly deserve.Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways gleaming across our beautiful land.Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately, stop. And our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope, safety and opportunity.Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American People.It s been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to take this moment to update the nation on the progress I ve made in keeping those promises.Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart and many others, have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.The stock market has gained almost $3 trillion in value since the election on November 8th, a record. We ve saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of the fantastic new F-35 jet fighter, and will be saving billions more dollars on contracts all across our government.We have placed a hiring freeze on non-military and non-essential federal workers.We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing a five-year ban on lobbying by Executive Branch officials   and a lifetime ban on becoming lobbyists for a foreign government.We have undertaken a historic effort to eliminate job-crushing regulations, creating a deregulation task force inside of every government agency; imposing a new rule which mandates that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated; and stopping a regulation that threatens the future and livelihoods of our great coal miners.We have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines   thereby creating tens of thousands of jobs   and I ve issued a new directive that new American pipelines be made with American steel.We have withdrawn the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.With the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, we have formed a council with our neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets and capital they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Justice to form a Task Force on ReducingViolent Crime.I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department of State and the Director of National Intelligence, to coordinate an aggressive strategy to dismantle the Criminal Cartels that have spread across our nation.We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth   and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.At the same time, my Administration has answered the pleas of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security.By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone.We want all Americans to succeed   but that can t happen in an environment of lawless chaos.We must restore integrity and the rule of law to our borders.For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a Great Wall along our Southern Border. As we speak, we are removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our citizens.Bad ones are going out as I speak tonight and as I have promised.To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this question: What would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income or a loved one, because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders?Our obligation is to serve, protect and defend the citizens of the United states.We are also taking strong measures to protect our nation from Radical Islamic Terrorism.According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted for terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country.We have seen the attacks at home   from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and yes, even the World Trade Center.We have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany and all over the world.It is not compassionate, but reckless, to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur.Those given the high honor of admission to the United States, should support this country and love its people and its values.We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America   we cannot allow our nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.That is why my Administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our nation safe   and to keep out those who would do us harm.As promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS   a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, women, and children of all faiths and beliefs.We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim World, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet.I have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran s ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the State of Israel.Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a Justice to the United States Supreme Court from my list of 20 judges who will defend our Constitution.I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight.Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a symbol of American Justice.To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil Gorsuch, a man of incredible skill, and deep devotion to the law.He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate to swiftly approve his nomination.Tonight, as I outline the next steps we must take as country, we must honestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited.Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force.Over 43 million people are now living in poverty, and over 43 million Americans are on food stamps.More than one in five people in their prime-working years are not working.We have the worst financial recovery in 65 years.In the last 8 years, the past Administration has put on more new debt than nearly all other Presidents combined.We ve lost more than one-fourth of our manufacturing jobs since NAFTA was approved, and we ve lost 60,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001.Our trade deficit in goods with the world last year was nearly $800 billion dollars.And overseas, we have inherited a series of tragic foreign policy disasters.Solving these, and so many other pressing problems, will require us to work past the differences of Party.It will require us to tap into the American Spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history.president-trump-sou-3But to accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American Economy   making it easier for companies to do business in the United States, and much harder for companies to leave.Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world.My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone.At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class.We must create a level playing field for American companies and workers.Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes   but when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them almost nothing.I just met with officials and workers from a great American company, Harley Davidson.In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles, made in the USA, on the front lawn of the White House.At our meeting, I asked them, how are you doing, how is business?They said that it s good.I asked them further how they are doing with other countries, mainly international sales.They told me   without even complaining because they have been mistreated for so long that they have become used to it   that it is very hard to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate.They said that in one case another country taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent.They weren t even asking for change.But I am.I believe strongly in free trade but it also has to be FAIR TRADE.The first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned that  The abandonment of the protective policy by the American government will produce want and ruin among our people. Lincoln was right   and it is time we heeded his words.I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of anymore.I am going to bring back millions of jobs.Protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration.The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers, and putsgreat pressure on taxpayers.Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others   have a merit-based immigration system.It is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially.Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon.According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America s taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.Switching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration, and instead adopting a merit-based system, will have many benefits: It will save countless dollars, raise workers  wages, and help struggling families   including immigrant families   enter the middle class.I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals: To improve jobs and wages for Americans, to strengthen our nation s security, and to restore respect for our laws.If we are guided by the well-being of American citizens, instead of the unusual special interests, then I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.Another Republican President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly great national infrastructure program   the building of the interstate highway system.The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding.America has spent approximately $6 trillion in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home is crumbling.With this $6 trillion we could have rebuilt our country   twice.And maybe even three times if we had people who had the ability to negotiate.To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion dollar investment in the infrastructure of the United States   financed through both public and private capital   creating millions of new jobs.This effort will be guided by two core principles: Buy American, and Hire American.Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE, with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and at the same time, provide better healthcare.Mandating every American to buy government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for America.The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do.Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits   as an example, Arizona went up 116% last year alone.Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his state   it is unsustainable and collapsing.One third of counties have only one insurer on the exchanges   leaving many Americans with no choice at all.Remember when you were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan?We now know that all of those promises have been broken.Obamacare is collapsing   and we must act decisively to protect all Americans.Action is not a choice   it is a necessity.So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster.Here are the principles that should guide Congress as we move to create a better healthcare system for all Americans: First, we should ensure that Americans with pre-existing conditions have access to coverage, and that we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges.Secondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage, through the use of tax credits and expanded Health Savings Accounts   but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by the government.Thirdly, we should give our state governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out.Fourth, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance   and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs, and bring them down immediately.Finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across state lines   creating a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring cost way down and provide far better care.Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed.Every problem can be solved.And every hurting family can find healing, and hope.Our citizens deserve this, and so much more   so why not join forces to finally get it done?On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country, and for the good of the American people.My administration wants to work with members in both parties to make childcare accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents have Paid Family Leave, to invest in women s health, and to promote clean air and clear water, and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who deserves a brighter future.An incredible young woman is with us this evening who should serve as an inspiration to us all.Today is Rare Disease day, and joining us in the gallery is a Rare Disease Survivor, Megan Crowley.Megan was diagnosed with Pompay Disease, a rare and serious illness when she was 15 months old.She was not expected to live past five.On receiving this news, Megan s dad, John, fought with everything he had to save the life of his precious child.He founded a company to look for a cure, and helped develop the drug that saved Megan s life.Today she is 20 years old   and a sophomore at Notre Dame.Megan s story is about the unbounded power of a father s love for a daughter.But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megan s life, from reaching those in need.If we slash the restraints, not just at the FDA, but across our government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan.In fact, our children will grow up in a nation of miracles.But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind   and the souls   of every American child.Education is the civil rights issue of our time.I am calling upon members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African-American and Latino children.These families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school that is right for them.Joining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather.As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third grade twice.But then she was able to enroll in a private center for learning with the help of a tax credit scholarship program.Today, she is the first in her family to graduate not just from high school, but from college.Later this year she will get her masters degree in social work.We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha.But to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence.The murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single-year increase in nearly half a century.In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone   and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher.This is not acceptable in our society.Every American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to attend a great school, and to have access to a high-paying job.But to create this future, we must work with   not against   the men and women of law enforcement.We must build bridges of cooperation and trust   not drive the wedge of disunity and division.Police and sheriffs are members of our community.They are friends and neighbors, they are mothers and fathers, sons and daughters   and they leave behind loved ones every day who worry whether or not they ll come home safe and sound.We must support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.And we must support the victims of crime.I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American victims.The office is called VOICE   Victims Of Immigration Crime Engagement.We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests.Joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them.Their names are Jamiel Shaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver, and Jessica Davis.Jamiel s 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison.Jamiel Shaw Jr. was an incredible young man, with unlimited potential who was getting ready to go to college where he would have excelled as a great quarterback.But he never got the chance.His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a good friend of mine.Also with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis.Their husbands   Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis   were slain in the line of duty in California.They were pillars of their community.These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.Sitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna.Jenna: I want you to know that your father was a hero, and that tonight you have the love of an entire country supporting you and praying for you.To Jamiel, Jenna, Susan and Jessica: I want you to know   we will never stop fighting for justice   your loved ones will never be forgotten, we will always honor their memory.Finally, to keep America Safe we must provide the men and women of the United States Military with the tools they need to prevent war and   if they must   TO FIGHT AND TO WIN.I am sending Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the Defense Sequester, and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.My budget will also increase funding for our Veterans.Our Veterans have delivered for this nation   and now we must deliver for them.The challenges we face as a nation are great.But our people are even greater.And none are greater or braver than those who fight for America in uniform.We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of a U.S. Navy Special Operator, Senior Chief William  Ryan  Owens.Ryan died as he lived: a warrior, and a hero   battling against terrorism and securing our nation.I just spoke to General Mattis who reconfirmed that, and I quote,  Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies. Ryan s legacy is etched into eternity.For as the bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down one s life for one s friends.Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for our Freedom   we will never forget him.To those allies who wonder what kind of friend America will be, look no further than the heroes who wear our uniform.Our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust and meaningful engagement with the world.It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies across the globe.We strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two World Wars that dethroned fascism, and a Cold War that defeated communism.But our partners must meet their financial obligations.And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that.We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East, or the Pacific   to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost.We will respect historic institutions, but we will also respect the sovereign rights of nations.Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people   and America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path.My job is not to represent the world.My job is to represent the United States of America.But we know that America is better off, when there is less conflict   not more.We must learn from the mistakes of the past   we have seen the war and destruction that have raged across our world.The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely return home and begin the long process of rebuilding.America is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align.We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict.We want peace, wherever peace can be found.America is friends today with former enemies.Some of our closest allies, decades ago, fought on the opposite side of these World Wars.This history should give us all faith in the possibilitiesfor a better world.Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful, more just and more free.On our 100th anniversary, in 1876, citizens from across our nation came to Philadelphia to celebrate America s centennial.At that celebration, the country s builders and artists and inventors showed off their creations.Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time.Remington unveiled the first typewriter.An early attempt was made at electric light.Thomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric pen.Imagine the wonders our country could know in America s 250th year.Think of the marvels we can achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people.Cures to illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope.American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream.Millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect.And streets where mothers are safe from fear   schools where children learn in peace   and jobs where Americans prosper and grow   are not too much to ask.When we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever before.For all Americans.This is our vision.This is our mission.But we can only get there together.We are one people, with one destiny.We all bleed the same blood.We all salute the same flag.And we are all made by the same God.And when we fulfill this vision; when we celebrateour 250 years of glorious freedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness began.The time for small thinking is over.The time for trivial fights is behind us.We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts.The bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls.And the confidence to turn those hopes and dreams to action.From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations   not burdened by our fears. Inspired by the future   not bound by the failures of the past. And guided by our vision   not blinded by our doubts.I am asking all citizens to embrace this Renewal of the American Spirit.I am asking all members of Congress to join me in Dreaming Big, and Bold and Daring things for our country.And I am asking everyone watching tonightto seize this moment and   Believe In Yourselves.Believe In Your Future.And Believe, Once More, In America.Thank you, God bless you, and God Bless these United States",politics,"Mar 1, 2017",27581
"WOW! Stepson Of New Roy Moore Accuser Makes Emotional Video…Says Stepmom is Lying: “For Whatever Reason She’s Doing This, I’m Truly Sorry”","Yesterday, Beverly Young Nelson sat with the same leftist lawyer, Gloria Allred, who came out after Donald Trump with false allegations of sexual harassment against Donald Trump before the election and made a public statement, claiming she was sexually assaulted by Judge Roy Moore when she was a teenager. Today, Beverly Young Nelson s son Darrel Nelson made a public Facebook video to let America know he s behind Judge Roy Moore and that believes his stepmother is not telling the truth about Judge Moore sexually assaulting her when she was a teen.Here is part of his transcript:Good evening. As I said today, I found out today, that my stepmother is one of the ladies that s accusing Judge Moore of an act that supposedly happened when she was a teenager. My father s name is John Allen Nelson. The woman that s committed this act against Mr. Moore, is Beverly Young Nelson. It s hard for me to actually have this conversation, but it must be done. Mr. Moore, I support you. I don t believe the acts that she s claimed you ve done. I don t believe it. I ve known the woman, she married my father many, many years ago, I ve known her for a while now, and I truly do not believe that she s being honest about this. You re a good judge. I ve growed up, I ve known your name since I was a kid. You cared about the ten commandments. You tried like hell to keep the ten commandments from being taken out of the courthouse. I remember. I ve been a member of Etowah County my whole life. I was born here. Now I m twisted. To you Mr. Moore, and to your wife, I do apologize. For whatever reason, she s doing this, and I am truly sorry. I stand behind you 100%. And to my stepmother, for whatever reasons you did this Why did you, I have a few questions about this: Why did you wait so long if this did happen? You waited, you said you were a teenager when it happened. Well, here it now, how many years later? And all of a sudden, now you re gonna bring it up when he s fixin  to go, and we done votin  him into the House, and you re trying to get him took out. I ve tried to keep quiet on your name because I see your name flying around everywhere.But I am a Moore supporter, but officially, this is the statement I ve been meaning to make. I know I m gonna get some backlash from my family, but that s okay. We the people made the decision. It s over. Democrats are taking a shot at it, using any and everybody they can get so they can tarnish his record, to get a Democrat to take his place. Well, I m sorry. We re not gonna have that.

MICHIGAN PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL Hosts Segregated Muslim Sharia Prom,"THE ARTICLE BELOW makes the  Princess Prom  seem harmless it s not. Sharia is creeping into our American way of life every day. The town of Hamtramck, Michigan is a perfect example of Islam quietly taking over towns across America.  It s really a silent invasion and Americans are just rolling over and letting it happen.A recent article we reported on regarding Sharia in America: MINNEAPOLIS MUSLIM Tries To Enforce Sharia In Neighborhood:  People who don t know me would say I m a terrorist And another: TOUGH TEXAS MAYOR Who Fought Back Against Implementation Of Sharia Law In Her City Will Join Trump Team [VIDEO]And another: TEXAS MUSLIMS PRAYING IN METHODIST CHURCH CLAIM:  Sharia is just like the Constitution  [Video]See our point? This is creeping into our towns and has already taken over in Hamtramck:In case you haven t heard, this Michigan town just recently became the first town in America to have an all Muslim City Council. This town went from being a diverse blend of many cultures to being majority Muslim. Michigan is heading in the direction of being majority Muslim with the next Democrat candidate for governor being Muslim This is why what s happening at this high school is so disturbing We bend over backwards to accommodate Muslims for fear of being called  Islamophobic .  All the while, SHARIA is becoming more and more accepted. Islamic prayer rooms in public schools? Lessons on Islam in public school? Hijab Day so the girls can see what it s like to wear a hijab? Yes, these things and more have been happening in YOUR public schools across America.What may seem like a harmless girls-only prom, is the beginning of the end for some who are aware The Princess Prom is a special prom organized for Hamtramck s high school girls. Started in 2012, the Princess Prom began as a way for the students be able to attend prom, which many could not due to cultural and religious reasons. The special prom allows the students to to dress and dance freely among other women. on May 06, 2017 at 8:00 AM, updated May 08, 2017 at 10:48 AM A Detroit-area high school is holding an all-girls prom to create a comfortable and safe environment for girls who cannot attend the traditional co-ed prom for cultural reasons.That s right. Boys are not allowed.Five Muslim girls from Hamtramck High School started  Princess Prom  in 2012 to give girls the opportunity to dress up as they please and dance the night away.Last year, 230 girls showed up to the dance at the PNA Banquet Hall in Hamtramck. This year, the team expects about 250 in attendance.The event is intended to create a safe space for Muslim girls who normally cover up in hijab to let their hair down in an environment with no boys and no cellphones.Phones are banned to prevent problems with photos being posted to social media. We re on our phones 24-7 and if you don t have it for a few hours, it s so calming and everybody is having a fun time,  said Aisha Khanum, an 18-year-old student at Hamtramck High School who has been on Princess Prom planning committee for three years.The dance offers a separate zone for anyone who needs to use their phone.Like any other prom, the girls show up in extravagant gowns, shiny stilettos and flashy makeup and hair styles, and they are surrounded with food and lively music.This one adds an extra cultural element with henna tattoos, a popular form of body art in parts of the Middle Eastern, North African and South Asia. The girls work through the year to do fundraising,  said Caitlin Drinkard, a school counselor who helps organize the annual event.  They sold walking tacos, T-shirts, flowers on Valentine s Day.

THIS IS RICH! COMMIE NYC MAYOR UNLEASHES CLASS WAR ON SCOTT WALKER FROM SWANKY PRIVATE CLUB,"New York Mayor Bill de Blasio traveled to Milwaukee to attend a fundraiser where he delivered a blistering speech attacking Scott Walker and the wealthy. Governor Walker is part of a dangerous breed of Republicans, a group actively working to dismantle the foundation for middle-class life. Now listen,  he told attendees, according to the transcript,  I m not saying Scott Walker set out to destroy Wisconsin s middle class. But if that were his mission, I can t think of a (darn) thing he d had done differently! It s no wonder why the latest polls show Governor Walker s approval sinking to new lows. The people of Wisconsin can see beyond his pleasant smile and reassuring words. He tries to play the everyman   then he stabs the everyman in the back.

 All Ammosexual Hell Breaks Loose On Twitter Because One Woman Dared To Make This Statement (TWEET),"When comedian Alison Leiby tweeted a pretty cute, common sense joke in December, she had no idea how violent the repercussions would be. Conservative extremists have been sending her threats of rape and death every since.On December 16 2015, Leiby tweeted her 10,000 followers a fairly straightforward gag:As a woman, I just hope that one day I have as many rights as a gun does.  Alison Leiby (@AlisonLeiby) December 17, 2015Leiby describes what happened next in a piece for Medium:Somewhere along the way an account with a large and conservative following retweeted it, an action that flooded my notifications page with people calling me  stupid  or a  moron  or, one of my personal favorites, a  retarded liberal.  Fine.Last Monday evening, however, the replies went from annoying and insulting to violent and threatening. Men were replying to me and taking my joke to a horrific, new place. Some said they wanted to ban me from public places and silence me. Others said they wanted to lock me in their closet when they re done with me. A few choice gentlemen suggested I, like their gun, have a  rough brush clean my holes. She is not exaggerating the backlash. Even by the darkest depths of Twitter standards, it makes truly grim reading. We won t give the losers the honor of the airtime here but you can check out the twitter conversation for yourself by clicking on the original tweet above.Obviously, this reaction is hyper-hypocritical from people who present the case for their guns as a freedom and liberty issue. If they want the right to bear arms, doesn t Leiby have the right to free speech? It s not like they have to read what she writes. They made a choice to read it. As she points out, If you don t like the taste of fish, you wouldn t go to a restaurant, order the trout, and then call the chef a stupid bitch for serving it to you. So why do people do it on the Internet? Misogyny is not a joke. It is not some hobby horse that  angry women  ride around to piss men off. It killed 18,000American women in the last 12 years. This means that more women have been killed at the hands of their husbands and boyfriends since 9/11, than Americans died during 9/11, and in all terror attacks and wars since.In a 2005 study, yet to be repeated, a leading cause of death among pregnant American woman was homicide by their male partner or ex. Only pregnancy-related complications ranked higher.This is a crisis. A crisis which Leiby came at from about the least offensive, lightest way possible. Yet she faced the united, violent reaction of the very same men who likely commit and defend these crimes. Their intention? To stop women from raising these issues in the public space. So we need to keep raising these issues, defiantly and relentlessly, until the day they are consigned to the dustbin of history   which is the only place they belong.

TWO BALTIMORE POLICE OFFICERS CHARGED In Brutal Beating Of 16 Yr Old Caught On VIDEO…Why Al Sharpton And Black Lives Matter Terrorists Won’t Care,"This story will fade quickly to back page news in the mainstream media. Two black officers supposedly physically abused a 16 year old black boy. Yawn   If these police officers were white you d be seeing this story ad nauseum until those officers lives were threatened, they lost their jobs and were behind bars. Black Lives Matter terrorists and Obama s Race War Czar, Al Sharpton wouldn t be satisfied until a city was burned to the ground, the entire police force was called out for being  racists  and someone (preferably a white person) in the police department was fired for not preventing this from happening. AP  Two officers who police Baltimore s public schools walked out of jail Wednesday pending trial for assault and misconduct after their violent confrontation with a student was recorded by another teenager.Both have checkered records, prompting parents and authorities alike to question whether enough is being done to prevent violent people from being hired to keep schoolchildren peaceful and safe.Here s the assault caught on tape:https://youtu.be/zZPX_bzka40Police said Wednesday that Saverna Bias allegedly told her fellow officer, Anthony Spence, to use force against the teen.According to a witness, she said,  You need to smack him because he s got too much mouth,  police said. The video shows Spence shouting profanities as he repeatedly slaps and kicks the boy, telling him to leave the school and go home.Spence was not trying to arrest the 10th grader, neither was he acting in reasonable self-defense, city police said.In the cellphone video, Spence is heard shouting while he repeatedly slaps the 16-year-old student and kicks him at REACH Partnership School, while Bias looks on.Spence s attorney Mike Davey told the Baltimore Sun on Thursday that his client believed the 16-year-old and his friend was trespassing on school grounds. Both said they were students at REACH, but Davey said they were not wearing uniforms and could not provide the principal s name when questioned.The 16-year-old was later confirmed as a student at REACH, his attorney told the newspaper.  BuzzfeedAt a packed school board meeting Tuesday night, some parents and principals implored officials to keep officers in the schools for everyone s safety. Students and their advocates countered that having armed police with insufficient oversight in schools can be damaging and dangerous.Tim Martin, an administrator at the New Hope Academy, said he understands the frustration, but believes most officers show enough patience to  therapeutically de-escalate students in crisis and help school personnel maintain a safe school environment. Spence, 44, and Bias, 53, turned themselves in Tuesday night and were released on bond on charges of second-degree assault and misconduct in office. Spence also is charged with second-degree child abuse. Both officers have been suspended, and Spence is being denied pay, since he faces a felony.Baltimore School Police Chief Marshall Goodwin, whose department is separate from the city s police force, also went on leave, for  personal reasons,  as the video began circulating a day after the March 1 confrontation. A week later, as city police and prosecutors continue investigating, Baltimore City Schools CEO Gregory Thornton has refused to explain his absence.",left-news,"Mar 9, 2016",3312
 The New GOP Healthcare Bill Targets Women And Plans To Defund Planned Parenthood,"The super top-secret GOP healthcare bill has been released. Hidden within all the kerfuffle is a woman s worst nightmare: Planned Parenthood losing its funding.Reported by The Hill, the Senate healthcare bill will defund Planned Parenthood for one year. The GOP bill follows the same language in the House-passed health care bill that blocks Medicaid reimbursements to Planned Parenthood.If this bill goes through, the beacon of women s health care and abortion services will be gone unless Planned Parenthood can find another viable option for funding.Of course, it s not just women that Planned Parenthood helps. They provide health care for women, men, young people, while also acting as the U.S. s largest provider of sex education. All are very crucial services.It s vital that Planned Parenthood retains its funding and we need people and our government to understand that. Thankfully, two Republican senators, Lisa Murkowski (Ala.) and Susan Collins (Maine), have already suggested they may not support the bill if it defunds Planned Parenthood, The Hill reports.Collins said Wednesday if the bill included defunding language, she and Murkowski would introduce an amendment to strip it out.Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards released a statement saying: If this is the Senate s idea of a bill with heart, then the women of America should have fear struck in theirs. Slashing Medicaid and blocking millions of women from getting preventive care at Planned Parenthood is beyond heartless. One in five women in this country rely on Planned Parenthood for care. They will not stay silent as politicians vote to take away their care and their rights. Source: The HillIs this really what many Republicans say they want? To strip women of their beacon of health and wellness?

TIMES SQUARE ILLEGAL ALIEN PANHANDLERS Have No Fear of Arrest Because of de Blasio’s Policy on Illegals,"It s bad enough to have crazed costumed characters in Times Square begging and harassing tourists but the NYPD can t even arrest the mostly illegal aliens because of the policy of the de Blasio administration. Costumed and nude panhandlers are giving the finger to attempts to rein them in, refusing to stay in designated areas and continuing to curse in front of kiddies and threaten passers-by for dough.Breitbart News Reported: Mayor Bill de Blasio has stated that the NYPD won t cooperate with federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents seeking to repatriate illegal immigrants:   The NYPD will not participate as immigration enforcement agents because we have, for decades, built a close working relationship with immigrant communities,  de Blasio said.  Our police force is not going to be out there knocking on people s door and it is not going to share information about people s documentation status with the federal authorities. City officials city and the NYPD officers will cooperate with the feds only in immigration cases which involve  serious and violent crimes, Foul-mouthed desnudas, grabby Hulks and tourist-terrorizing gangs of Minnie Mice are still brazenly holding the Crossroads of the World hostage even amid a heavy presence of NYPD cops, who act oblivious to their disturbing antics.At any given moment on two recent afternoons, only half of the two-dozen tip-mooching characters stayed behind the blue lines of Times Square s  Designated Activity Zones,  or DAZs, the city-mandated areas created last year as their boundary for posing for photos and asking for tips.Yet none of those who illegally strayed outside the zones were issued summonses by the half-dozen police patrolling the pedestrian plaza.A law-enforcement source shrugged that the officers  hands were tied since most of the costumed panhandlers are illegal   and under the de Blasio administration, it s a no-no to go after them.The law-enforcement source added that past proposals to license the creatures went nowhere because most of the panhandlers are illegal immigrants and they wouldn t register anyway. Besides, the administration at City Hall isn t interested in going after illegals in this capacity, the source said.The most shameless of the costumed pack repeatedly left the DAZs to grab, mob and berate tourists    Take a photo lady! Mami!  shouted a trio of overly-aggressive Minnie Mice   in their frantic pursuit of cash. I told you, if you don t have a tip, then f  off!  one star-spangled desnuda, a painted nude hustler, snarled to a Post reporter, displaying just the sort of greed that detractors say is ruining Times Square s happy, family vibe.This insanity was reported by a New York Post reporter who walked Times Square and spoke with different people.

“BLOOD ON THEIR HANDS” FOR VOTING RIGHTS: The Truth About Shocking Number Of Murders By Illegal Aliens In US Hidden By Media And Dems [VIDEO],"It s time to stop hitting the snooze button America! This crisis is no longer on our doorstep it s here. The Democrats, corporations and the Chamber of Commerce want to give these criminals the same rights as you and me Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump deserves credit for forcing all 17 Republican candidates to talk about the social costs of illegal immigration, but it is not  Trump s issue.  We will be making a fatal mistake if we let the media discuss it that way.As Ann Coulter has pointed out, this is the most critical issue of the 2016 race because this is the issue that will define whether or not there will even be an American nation recognizable as the  home of the free and land of the brave. But illegal immigration is not  Ann Coulter s issue  any more than it is  Tom Tancredo s issue.  It is America s issue   not only because it will define America in the 21st Century but because it also defines American elections and who will be voting in elections in 2020 and beyond. It also illuminates the power of the mainstream media to keep issues off the national stage.Think of illegal immigration this way: If the liberal media can keep illegal alien crime out of the  kitchen table debate,  they can keep any issue out of the debate. And they will if they can get away with it. For those reasons, illegal immigration is much more than an issue of public policy; it is the poster child for media malpractice.The media s attempt to suppress public awareness over illegal alien crime and the effects of illegal immigration on American workers  jobs and wages is nothing less than censorship on a massive scale. We need to start talking about it in those terms and hold the media accountable for the lack of ethical standards.The mainstream media   including, sadly, major segments of the presumably conservative media, like the Wall Street Journal   are working overtime to keep the American public and the American voters in the dark on the scope of illegal alien crime. The murder of Kate Steinle in San Francisco exposed only the tip of a massive iceberg, and the media establishment is desperate to avoid dealing with the iceberg underneath.Let s look at a few numbers. You haven t seen them in the New York Times, Atlanta Constitution, or the Miami Herald, nor have they been featured on NBC Nightly news or CNN. So, the average American is blissfully unaware of them.Between 2008 and 2014, 40% of all murder convictions in Florida were criminal aliens. In New York it was 34% and Arizona 17.8%. During those years, criminal aliens accounted for 38% of all murder convictions in the five states of California, Texas, Arizona, Florida and New York, while illegal aliens constitute only 5.6% of the total population in those states. That 38% represents 7,085 murders out of the total of 18,643. That 5.6% figure for the average illegal alien population in those five states comes from US Census estimates. We know the real number is double that official estimate. Yet, even if it is 11%, it is still shameful that the percentage of murders by criminal aliens is more than triple the illegal population in those states.Those astounding numbers were compiled by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) using official Department of Justice data on criminal aliens in the nation s correctional system. The numbers were the basis for a presentation at a recent New Hampshire conference sponsored by the highly respected Center for Security Policy. You can view the full presentation here:The federal Bureau of Prisons category  criminal aliens  includes legal immigrants who have been convicted of serious crimes, but over 90% of incarcerated criminal aliens are illegal aliens, so it is reasonable to use these numbers as a close approximation of the extent of illegal alien crime.Similar data is available at the state level if state officials have the desire to look for it. The Texas Department of Public Safety reports that between 2008 and 2014, 35% of the all murder convictions were illegal aliens averaging 472 murders each year from 2004 to 2008.Do you know the numbers for your state? Does your congressman, Senator, or Governor know those numbers? Of course not. If you are afraid of the answer, don t ask the question.There is widespread public ignorance of illegal alien crime in every state because the mainstream media does investigate such matters. Why? Because they do not want the public to think about such things. The media, from the Associated Press down to the Main Street News, does not even allow the phrase  illegal immigrant  to appear in print.So, the numbers are out there in the criminal justice system and correctional institutions, waiting to be compiled and published. State attorneys general and state legislators could access the data if they were interested, and so could the media, but they don t. In fact, in Colorado in 2006, the state legislature passed a law ordering the state Attorney General to compile accurate data on the costs of incarcerating illegal aliens and send a bill for reimbursement to the federal government. The state AG sent the feds a bill for only half the real costs   the cost of inmates in the state prison system and not the costs imposed on taxpayers by an equal number of inmates in county jails across the state.The US Department of Justice s Bureau of Justice Programs publishes an annual report on the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, a report that includes data on the number of criminal aliens incarcerated each state prison system and each county jail. It takes some prodigious digging to find the data, but it is there.But our mainstream media, our self-described guardians of the First Amendment, consciously avoids the effort and declines to put a public spotlight on the problem or demand public scrutiny and public accountability. Why?The answer is that public debate on the problem of illegal alien crime does not serve the progressive political agenda. The issue is swept under the rug and anyone who raises it is called a racist.This is media malpractice of historic proportions, and publishers and editors are the unindicted coconspirators in those 7,085 murders.",Government News,"Aug 9, 2015",6183
Zakharova Slams CIA Chief Pompeo: Stop Making Up Anti-Russian Fiction,"21st Century Wire says With the ongoing hysteria constantly spouting from the American mainstream media about alleged  Russian meddling  in the 2016 election which saw Donald Trump elected as president of the United States, the world is still awaiting a single shred of real evidence to support the establishment s conspiracy theory. To date, none has surfaced. The intelligence community has said that this election was meddled with by the Russians in a way that frankly is not particularly original. They ve been doing this for an awfully long time, and we are decades into the Russians trying to undermine American democracy,  CIA chief Mike Pompeo told MSNBC s Hugh Hewitt in an exclusive interview that aired Saturday, June 24.Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, has made a noteworthy response to Pompeo s comments.via Russia InsiderTranslation: We could not but take note of and comment on the June 24 statement by CIA Director Mike Pompeo during his NBC interview. The statement dealt with Russia s alleged long time attempts to undermine the American democracy and meddling in the US elections. It appears that in his opinion Russia s longtime attempts to undermine the US democracy have culminated in the interference in US elections. As we know the issue of Russia s meddling in the election process has become a favorite media story and an obsession in the United States. This story has been adopted by anti-Russia propagandists. This issue continues to pick up momentum and is mentioned in statements by officials who are trying to accuse Russia of engaging in unlawful actions but who have failed to produce any evidence to date.We would like to remind them about some outstanding pages of US history. Unlike the Americans, we have real facts at our disposal, and we know what we should focus on. It is common knowledge that since the early 1990s the United States had voiced its intentions to establish a Jeffersonian democracy in Russia. But the very fact of setting such a task completely runs counter to the ideas of Thomas Jefferson, one of the founding fathers of the American nation and democracy. All of us know he called for respecting various forms of government, chosen by other nations and said the United States would not impose its will anywhere. He was mistaken. Thomas Jefferson referred to the idea of dictating the form of government to an independent country as arrogant, brutal and outrageous.It appears that the ideologists of the present-day America have very poor knowledge of their own history and the foundations of their statehood, if the concepts of  exporting democracy  and  humanitarian intervention  have become their favorite method for conducting an aggressive foreign policy as part of their national concept. For decades, dozens of countries all over the world have been suffering from US-imposed sate system formulas they are trying to equate all countries under one and the same pattern, without any consideration for what makes each of them unique. This policy and experiments cannot be called harmless. In the past few years Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Egypt, Syria and Ukraine have fallen prey to this concept. Needless to say, al-Qaeda in all its manifestations, ISIS and other radical terrorist groups of all religious denominations evolved on the fertile soil created by the Americans and in fact often were the brainchildren of these forces.Generous financial injections in the form of projects and grants through numerous foundations and NGOs is another  grey zone  through which the United States has been trying to influence political processes all over the world for many years. Russia virtually tops the list of these allocations. Various government and non-government organizations, including the Peace Corps, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the National Democratic Institute, the International Republican Institute and many other similar agencies, have been planting their agents for decades in order to penetrate the Russian political establishment and media community and to influence public opinion. According to some sources, the US has spent 5 Billion dollars for these purposes in the 1990s alone. It is very strange that, while making such statements, Mr. Pompeo forgets that many decisions stipulating the allocation of funding were approved by his own agency. It is strange that Washington forgets the fact that in the run-up to the 1996 Russian presidential election, the Federal Reserve bank delivered $500 million in cash to the US Embassy in Moscow under a far-fetched pretext of avoiding frenzied demand during the exchange of old $100 notes. Operatives from the CIA s Moscow Embassy station, headed by Michael Sulick, virtually slept on the money bags, while guarding them. Foreign-made cars delivered small batches of money from the Embassy to certain individuals.Who did the US sponsor using this money? I believe we will also learn this someday. I do not mean our assumptions, everything is clear here  Well will know the specific names, dates and so on. Here are only a few examples of diverse US activities aiming to undermine stability in various regions worldwide and in those areas that are not ready to follow American instructions. We are in no way demanding that Mr. Pompeo should stop his rhetoric because this is in the realm of fiction. One should simply understand that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. We are ready. READ MORE RUSSIA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Russia FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"August 21, 2017",5594

FBI UNDERCOVER Informant On Hillary’s 2010 Sale Of Uranium Identified,"The FBI informant who went undercover to look into Hillary Clinton s role in an Obama administration-era uranium company was identified yesterday in an exclusive from Reuters:William Campbell, a Russian lobbyist, is the informant, according to Reuters. He will be testifying before a congressional committee about the 2010 sale of Uranium One, where a Russian-backed company bought a uranium firm with mines in the U.S. Campbell gave information to the FBI about what he saw while undercover as an informant. I have worked with the Justice Department undercover for several years, and documentation relating to Uranium One and political influence does exist and I have it    William CampbellCongressional committees have previously tried to interview Campbell, as he was undercover for roughly five years, working to get information on Russia s efforts to grow its atomic energy business in the U.S.Department of Justice spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores told The Hill that a deal was reached in late October, clearing the informant to talk to Congress for the first time   almost eight years after he first went undercover.Two House chairmen also announced a probe in late October which is digging into new reports about Russian efforts to influence the Uranium One nuclear purchase that gave Russia control of roughly 20 percent of America s uranium.When Clinton served as secretary of state, Russia routed millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation, and former President Bill Clinton collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in Russian speaking fees as part of Russian efforts to influence the U.S. government to approve the deal, The Hill reported.OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON THE GAG ORDER THAT HAS BEEN LIFTED BY SESSIONS:LAWYER FOR FBI INFORMANT: My Client Knows What Russians Were Saying During Bribery of Clintons [VIDEO]Campbell s attorney, Victoria Toensing, said on Fox Business that former attorneys general under the Obama administration are the reason her client hasn t been able to  tell what all the Russians were talking about during the time that all these bribery payments were made. The lawyer for the FBI informant under a gag order that prevents him from going before Congress spoke out about what s to come with the Clinton/Russia Uranium story:Fox Business reported: An informant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is under a gag order that prevents him from testifying before the United States Congress that Russian nuclear officials were involved in fraudulent dealings in 2009 before the Uranium One deal was approved.Former Attorney General Loretta Lynch blocked the informant from testifying last year and threatened criminal action against him if he were to do so.In an interview with FOX Business  Lou Dobbs, Victoria Toensing, the attorney representing the FBI informant, said she has never heard of a criminal penalty for breaching a non-disclosure agreement (NDA). If it does and it is unconstitutional and it s invalid, if it prohibits my client from giving information to the legislature, the executive cannot say to people,  Hey, you can t give information to another body of the government,  Toensing said.KEY POINTS: The Republican leadership was blocking the investigation into both Benghazi and the Russia uranium scandal involving Clinton.The NDA (gag order) is unconstitutional and Toensing says this type of gag order has a criminal penalty. She says she s never heard of this type of gag order.Victoria Toensing is one of the best lawyers in DC and will get to the bottom of this one way or another.

 An Anonymous Group Just Revealed The Direct Phone Numbers For White House Staffers,"Just after Donald Trump was sworn in, his administration dismantled the White House switchboard comment operating system. But now, there s a way to circumvent the alleged president s attempt to stifle dissention, thanks to an anonymous group. There was a time when this wasn t necessary. The public could call to express concerns during the Obama administration, but that was then and this is now. The public comments line was shut down and people who want to call in to complain are prompted to send messages through Facebook Messenger or other forms of social media. The  for all Americans  fake president doesn t want to hear your complaints. He is in power to receive adulation and nothing less.Then  White House Comment Line,  created by an anonymous group, came to the rescue. Open communication is the foundation of a good, functioning democracy,  a spokesperson for the group explained to the Gothamist in a statement.  But it s a two-way street. Right now there s  information  coming out of the White House to the people, but not much the other way around. They may have shut down the comment line, but we the people still have comments. In light of that, we wanted to create one way for the people to be heard. The group released phone numbers of White House staffers but intentionally did not include any they believed had a role in national security.The Gothamist reports:A solid chunk of the numbers were disconnected, probably during the Obama-to-Trump transition, but it s possible they ll be put back in use if Trump ever gets around to hiring White House staffers. We ve been calling the numbers on the list and have found a few fun ones somewhere in there you ll get a voice mailbox belonging to one  Conway, Kellyanne.

 Ice-T PUNKS Trump Supporters Into Believing That He Blocked Trump’s Phone Call,"Donald Trump is desperate to find singers to perform at his inauguration ceremony, so rapper Ice-T decided to have a little fun messing with Trump s supporters.For weeks, Trump s team has been reduced to looking under rocks to find someone to sing a song during his inauguration on January 20th. So far, no real stars have signed on because no one wants to hurt their career by associating themselves with a narcissistic asshole who will probably be the last president.Trump has even reportedly gone so far as to offer ambassadorships to talent managers if they can get some major performers to agree to appear.Well, Trump s desperation gave Ice-T, who also portrays Detective Tutuola on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, the opportunity to make Trump supporters lose their sh*t. And he made the most of it by telling his fans on Twitter that Trump called him to get him to perform but he ignored the call and blocked the number.I just got call to perform at the Inauguration .

ARIZONA BIKERS ARE ABOUT To Become Violent “Dreamers” Worst Nightmare At Upcoming Phoenix Trump Rally," The Left has been itching for a fight the only problem is, they ve been itching for a fight against Trump supporters who re outnumbered so they can t fight back. They may be biting off a bit more than they can chew this time around A group of bikers said it plans to protect supporters from possible violence at a Donald Trump rally scheduled to be held in Phoenix on Saturday. We re going to stand between them and any protesters that come onto the property and hopefully protect them from any bodily harm, should it get to that point,  Cindy Perrin with Lions Guard Arizona said.The rally is expected to begin Saturday about 4 p.m. at the Veterans Memorial Coliseum on the Arizona State Fairgrounds near 19th Avenue and McDowell Road.The protest will be held at nearby Encanto Park from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.Perrin said the biker group, made up mostly of retired police officers, such as herself, and veterans, will be wearing American flag bandanas so they are easy to identify. If they have any problems, they ll be able to locate us and ask us for help,  she said.Perrin said her group is not expecting things to take a violent turn outside of Trump s rally, unlike several events the presumptive Republican presidential nominee hosted in California. We re not expecting it to get to that point in Arizona,  she said.The bikers will not be the only group attempting to keep things calm on Saturday. Arizona Department of Public Safety Capt. Damon Cecil said his organization has reached out to groups both for and against Trump. Most of those groups   not all, but most of those groups   we have talked to their leadership and got assurances their protests were going to be peaceful,  he said.Protest organizers are also hoping things remain civil. My message to the folks that want to protest is: You know what? Why don t you pick up a clipboard, let s get some voter registrations and get some more families registered to vote who will vote against Trump come November,  Tony Navarette with Promise Arizona said.DREAM Act advocate Carmen Cornejo said protesters who act violently are doing nothing more than falling into line with Trump s rhetoric. I invite all young people to not react with violence to the provocations and the incendiary comments of Mr. Trump,  she said. Via: KTAR",left-news,"Jun 17, 2016",2288

 Trump Tells China To Keep Our Navy Drone And Gets POUNDED For Being So Unstable,"Donald Trump just proved once again that he is unfit to be president.Earlier this week, the Chinese Navy intercepted a United States oceanographic drone in the South China Sea.The federal government formally and politely requested that China give us our drone back.Trump, on the other hand, accused China of stealing the drone and demanded its return.China steals United States Navy research drone in international waters   rips it out of water and takes it to China in unprecedented act.

 Trump Plans To Celebrate 100th Day On Office With Another YUUGE Rally No One Will Show Up For,"Donald Trump is really excited about all the nothing he s accomplished in his first 100 days in office. So, he announced on Saturday that he plans to celebrate by throwing a  big rally  on his 100th day. Presumably, he expects a better turnout than he got for his pathetic inauguration.Next Saturday night I will be holding a BIG rally in Pennsylvania. Look forward to it!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 22, 2017Rally will be to mark Trump s 100 days in office & organized/paid for by Trump s campaign committee, per senior campaign official https://t.co/wYW92Z8a87  Jeremy Diamond (@JDiamond1) April 22, 2017So far, with 100 days under his belt, Trump hasn t managed to accomplish squat except for failing to follow through on his absurd campaign promises. Mexico isn t paying for his stupid wall. His Muslim Ban was shot down twice as bigoted and unconstitutional. Obamacare is still the law of the land. And he is known as the biggest recruiting tool ISIS has at the moment. Exactly why he thinks this warrants a party is unclear. But as can only be expected of a narcissist, he is somehow convinced that this is a great idea and it totally won t have an embarrassing turnout.It is worth pointing out that the day of Trump s  big rally  is the same night the White House Correspondents  Dinner will be taking place   without the man occupying the White House in attendance because the press hurt his feelings.On Friday, Trump tweeted that the 100-day mark is a  ridiculous standard. No matter how much I accomplish during the ridiculous standard of the first 100 days, & it has been a lot (including S.C.), media will kill!  Donald J.

He added that since he didn t have the slightest clue how to actually president when he took office, he should be given extra leeway. He also noted that even though repealing Obamacare was one of his biggest campaign promises, he has really only been thinking about if for two months. I ve been here 92 days, but I ve only been working on the health care, you know, I had to get like a little bit of grounding, right?  Trump told the Associated Press.

DONALD TRUMP JR. Releases Emails Related To Russian Lawyer Meeting…Here Are The Nothing Burger Emails The Media Was Salivating Over,"Donald Trump Jr. took to Twitter today to release all email communication with the Kremlin-linked lawyer, revealing that he had hoped to get his hands on information that would damage Hillary Clinton s campaign. Is this really news? Someone who Donald Trump Jr. knew wanted to help him, by revealing some dirt on Hillary, and Trump Jr. agreed to meet with them. Okay? So what? Would Hillary s camp have declined such a meeting? What about Robert Creamer, a felon and Democrat operative who s married to a US Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky of Illinois and had ties to the Hillary campaign and to our sitting President Barack Obama? He was caught red-handed in an undercover video by James O Keefe admitting to inciting violence at Trump rallies as a way to help Hillary win the election against Donald Trump? Why was that story dismissed by the media and this nothingburger story getting wall-to-wall coverage?Here is the tweet from Donald Trump Jr., who was clearly not worried about revealing the contents to the world. Here's my statement and the full email chain pic.twitter.com/x050r5n5LQ  Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) July 11, 2017Here is the statement made by Donald Trump Jr. about the release of the emails:Page 1:Page 2:Page 3:Page 4:The emails offer the first details about how the sitdown with Natalia Veselnitskaya, a Kremlin-linked Russian lawyer, came about.Trump Jr. posted the emails on Twitter shortly after they were first reported by The New York Times.Trump Jr. said in a statement he thought he was receiving opposition research. The information they suggested they had about Hillary Clinton I thought was Political Opposition Research,  Trump Jr. said. Throughout the exchange, he gave no indication that he was concerned about getting information from the Russian government, which the US intelligence community has concluded meddled in the election on his father s behalf.Trump Jr. and his high-powered white collar criminal defense lawyer, Alan Futerfas, insist he did nothing wrong. Media & Dems are extremely invested in the Russia story. If this nonsense meeting is all they have after a yr, I understand the desperation!  he defiantly tweeted Tuesday morning.The White House has said President Trump was unaware of the meeting, and he has not commented on the revelations about his eldest son.  NYPNot only do the emails appear to be another nothingburger for the rabid left and their allies in the media, but Donald Jr. should ve known that if the media didn t care about Hillary giving Russia one-fifth of all uranium production in the Untied States in exchange for donations to the Clinton Foundation (slush fund), they likely wouldn t care much else having to do with Crooked Hillary and the Russians.An April, 2015 article published by The New York Times tells a story of a corrupt Secretary of State who used her position as Secretary of State to gain massive donations to her Clinton Foundation while giving Vladimir Putin control of much of the United States uranium:The headline on the website Pravda trumpeted President Vladimir V. Putin s latest coup, its nationalistic fervor recalling an era when its precursor served as the official mouthpiece of the Kremlin:  Russian Nuclear Energy Conquers the World. The article, in January 2013, detailed how the Russian atomic energy agency, Rosatom, had taken over a Canadian company with uranium-mining stakes stretching from Central Asia to the American West. The deal made Rosatom one of the world s largest uranium producers and brought Mr. Putin closer to his goal of controlling much of the global uranium supply chain.But the untold story behind that story is one that involves not just the Russian president, but also a former American president and a woman who would like to be the next one.At the heart of the tale are several men, leaders of the Canadian mining industry, who have been major donors to the charitable endeavors of former President Bill Clinton and his family. Members of that group built, financed and eventually sold off to the Russians a company that would become known as Uranium One.As the Russians gradually assumed control of Uranium One in three separate transactions from 2009 to 2013, Canadian records show, a flow of cash made its way to the Clinton Foundation. Uranium One s chairman used his family foundation to make four donations totaling $2.35 million. Those contributions were not publicly disclosed by the Clintons, despite an agreement Mrs. Clinton had struck with the Obama White House to publicly identify all donors. Other people with ties to the company made donations as well.And shortly after the Russians announced their intention to acquire a majority stake in Uranium One, Mr. Clinton received $500,000 for a Moscow speech from a Russian investment bank with links to the Kremlin that was promoting Uranium One stock.

MEDIA IGNORES Time That Bill Clinton FIRED His FBI Director On Day Before Vince Foster Was Found Dead,"In its 109-year history, only one F.B.I. director had been fired   until Tuesday, when President Trump fired James B. Comey. In July 1993, President Bill Clinton fired William S. Sessions, who had been nominated to the post by President Ronald Reagan in 1987. Mr. Clinton said his attorney general, Janet Reno, reviewed Mr. Sessions s leadership and concluded  in no uncertain terms that he can no longer effectively lead the bureau. Mr. Sessions had been cited for ethical lapses, including taking free trips on F.B.I. aircraft and using government money to build a $10,000 fence at his home. Mr. Sessions was asked to resign, and was fired when he refused to do so.  Despite the president s severe tone, he seemed to regret having to force Mr. Sessions from his post,  The New York Times wrote about his dismissal:WASHINGTON, July 19  President Clinton today dismissed William S. Sessions, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who had stubbornly rejected an Administration ultimatum to resign six months after a harsh internal ethics report on his conduct.Mr. Clinton said he would announce his nominee to replace Mr. Sessions on Tuesday. He was expected to pick Judge Louis J. Freeh of Federal District Court in Manhattan; officials said Judge Freeh had impressed Mr. Clinton favorably on Friday at their first meeting.Mr. Clinton, explaining his reasons for removing Mr. Sessions, effective immediately, said,  We cannot have a leadership vacuum at an agency as important to the United States as the F.B.I. It is time that this difficult chapter in the agency s history is brought to a close.  Defiant to the EndBut in a parting news conference at F.B.I. headquarters after Mr. Clinton s announcement, a defiant Mr. Sessions   his right arm in a sling as a result of a weekend fall   railed at what he called the unfairness of his removal, which comes nearly six years into his 10-year term. Because of the scurrilous attacks on me and my wife of 42 years, it has been decided by others that I can no longer be as forceful as I need to be in leading the F.B.I. and carrying out my responsibilities to the bureau and the nation,  he said.  It is because I believe in the principle of an independent F.B.I. that I have refused to voluntarily resign. Mr. Clinton said that after reviewing Mr. Sessions s performance, Attorney General Janet Reno had advised him that Mr. Sessions should go.  After a thorough review by the Attorney General of Mr. Sessions s leadership of the F.B.I., she has reported to me in no uncertain terms that he can no longer effectively lead the bureau. Similarly, Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey on the recommendation of his attorney general, Jeff Sessions. (No relation to William S. Sessions.) There are no United States statutes that discuss the president s authority to remove the F.B.I. director.   NYT s Vince Foster: What the Media Won t Tell You Major media outlets reported Wednesday on the Supreme Court hearing of California lawyer Allan Favish s case that government photographs of Vincent Foster s death scene be released for public viewing. The media report that no fewer than five investigations have found that Foster committed suicide because he was depressed. But despite 10 years of denial by the major media, the Foster case has not  closed    as the Supreme Court hearing Wednesday demonstrated. The case won t close because of the failure of authorities to make full disclosure   and to conduct a full investigation into the case, including a complete autopsy.Vince Foster was not only deputy White House counsel but also the personal attorney to Bill and Hillary Clinton.On the night of Foster s death, top Clinton aides made a frantic effort to enter and remove documents from his West Wing office. In the days that followed, federal investigators were stymied in their investigation of Foster s office and strange death.Since Foster s July 1993 death, the facts of his death have been obfuscated by friends of Bill and Hillary in the major media, but here s the undeniable truth:There weren t  five  investigations into Foster s death, as the media report. The Park Police, best known for their meter and horse patrols around Washington, were put in charge of the initial death inquiry of the most important federal official to die suspiciously since President Kennedy. The Park Police, contradicting standard procedure, declared the death a suicide before launching their inquiry.Later, Robert Fiske, selected by Clinton s counsel Bernie Nussbaum and Janet Reno, quickly confirmed the Park Police probe as a suicide.But when Ken Starr entered the investigation, he reopened the case. His chief prosecutor in the case, Miquel Rodriguez, later quit the Starr investigation, claiming that Starr s staff was engaging in a cover-up of Foster s death.Rodriguez, a Harvard-educated federal prosecutor, argued that one of the Polaroid photos taken of Foster at the crime scene indicated an additional wound on Foster s neck   never noted on the autopsy report. Favish s suit before the Supreme Court is seeking to release this photo, among others.No fewer than three of the paramedics on the scene indicated in reports or testimony that the crime scene was consistent with a murder scene, not a suicide.A careful FBI microscopic investigation of Foster s shoes found not a trace of soil or grass stains on them, though he supposedly walked several hundred yards through wooded Fort Marcy Park to where his body was found. [Years later, Starr s investigation found plenty of soil and grass stains. Rodriguez charged that the shoes were tampered with to produce such  evidence. ]According to the FBI report on Vince Foster s death (below) blonde hairs were found on the body of Vince Foster, but were never investigated:Foster was found with little blood around his body   and despite claims that he fired the gun into his mouth, practically no blood was found on the front of his shirt.Foster was found with a 1913 revolver no one in his family could claim, with two serial numbers, made from the parts of three or more guns. None of Foster s fingerprints were found on the gun.For years, detail after detail emerged questioning the official ruling.Significant questions were raised about the unusual gun   a .38 Colt revolver made from the parts of three guns with two serial numbers   found conveniently in Vince s hand.The Park Police said one of the serial numbers indicated the gun was vintage 1913   and had no pedigree.Foster family members insisted neither Foster nor his father ever owned the old revolver.The NCIC keeps records of all law enforcment inquiries of serial numbers.On March 23, 2001, the FBI responded to requests made by a man names Craig Brinkley:Serial number 356555, one of the numbers on the gun, was never searched, not by the FBI, the Park Police or by that  investigation  by Ken Starr.Serial number 355055 was found on the frame of the gun. Brinkley believes that was the gun s real nnumber.That number was indeed searched by the Park Police, on the evening of Foster s death, more exactly at 22:45 EDT on July 20, 1993.Interestingly, searches were conducted on the same serial number no fewer than three times earlier that year, before Foster s death, on March 3, March 7 and April 29.Was someone checking to see that this gun had a  clean  predigree and was untraceable?The bullet from the gun that supposedly killed Foster was never found, despite intensive searches.Despite claims to the contrary, no one who knew Foster, including Hillary, Web Hubbell and his own wife, saw signs of depression.A so-called suicide note was found in an office briefcase that had been searched and found to be empty after Foster s death. The note was torn into 27 pieces. Yet an FBI examination found no trace of Foster s fingerprints on the note and a top Oxford handwriting expert found the note to be an  obvious  forgery.Despite the enormity of the case, Foster s autopsy lasted an astounding 45 minutes. The coroner in the case had previously been overruled in other cases he declared  suicides  that were later found to be murders.All of the X-rays taken during the autopsy are missing.Complete crime scene photos don t exist. The Park Police said all the photos were  accidentally  overexposed. A series of close-up Polaroids, which Favish is suing for, remain. This is just a brief summary of the dozens of inconsistencies in the case. Two New York homicide investigators who looked into the case concluded that Foster s body had been moved to the crime scene and that murder could not be ruled out.Despite overwhelming evidence of a cover-up, the media won t question the official ruling.Ken Starr, who could find no criminal wrongdoing on the part of the Clintons during his  intensive  probe, confirmed a ruling of suicide. Starr even hired O.J. Simpson s defense expert to prove his case.On August 23, 2016, The Daily Mail revealed that FBI agents  reported interviews documenting that Hillary Clinton s stinging humiliation of her friend and mentor Vince Foster in front of White House aides triggered the suicide of Vince Foster were missing from where they should be filed at the National Archives.On the first visit, archivist David Paynter provided the box of records that he said contained the FBI reports of interviews conducted by FBI agents on Foster s death. On a second visit, archivist James Mathis provided what he said were those same documents.While the box contained dozens of FBI reports concerning Foster s death   including interviews with the medical examiner, U.S. Park Police officers, and White House aides about the contents of Foster s office    the reports on Hillary Clinton s role in his death were absent.After filing a Freedom of Information request with the National Archives, Martha Murphy, the archives  public liaison, reported that she directed a senior archivist to conduct a more thorough review of the relevant FBI files, including those that had not been previously made public in response to FOIA requests. He examined all eight boxes but found no interviews by any investigator that detail either a meeting between Hillary Clinton and Vince Foster or the effects of a meeting between Hillary Clinton and Vince Foster on Vince Foster s state of mind,  Murphy reported in an email.After firing Republican FBI Director William S. Session, President Bill Clinton temporarily replaced him with Floyd I. Clarke and then on September 1, 1993 he Louis Freeh became the FBI Director. Right from the start, the Freeh FBI was drenched in controversy. The  screw-ups  were legion from the exposure of fraudulent FBI crime lab results to the wrongful blaming of an innocent man for the bombings at the Atlanta Olympics to the bloody standoff and shootout at Ruby Ridge.",left-news,"May 10, 2017",10781

 Trump’s Pathetic Thanksgiving Message Of ‘Unity’ Gets The Treatment It Deserves,"Hours before Thanksgiving Day began, Donald Trump once again called for that  unity  thing that conservatives think only white presidents deserve, and he got hammered for it.Trump had the gall to express  hope  that tensions in this country will begin to heal, even though he also seemed to whine that they weren t healing fast enough.

So, who better to call this Congressman out than Warren herself.In a fundraising email, she wrote: I won t be neutered Why would he go out of his way to say something so sexist and offensive? Is he hostile to all women? Clueless? Afraid? And using this opportunity to remind people who they should be fighting with, she said: Let s send the big banks and their buddies in Congress a message: They can try to roll back financial reform and they can have a few laughs about the woman they want to neuter, but we re ready to fight back anytime anywhere.

Warren is strong and not about to quit her fight against corruption where it stands on Wall Street any time soon. This Congressman is clearly terrified of her, because he knows that with her as a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee, he and his cronies are going to be held accountable for the shady business that transpires.Please never stop being you, Senator Warren, and thank you for fighting for Main Street as this Congressman clearly is fighting for Wall Street.Watch Warren discuss the comments while appearing on All In with Chris Hayes on MSNBC.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"March 18, 2016",2112
 Hollywood’s Secret Conservative Club Shuts Down Because Actors Can’t Stop Fighting Over Trump,"A highly exclusive, highly secretive club organized by and for Hollywood s (relatively small) conservative community has spectacularly imploded   and like many bad things, this can be blamed on Donald Trump.According to a recent announcement by  The Friends of Abe a club with members including Clint Eastwood, Gary Sinise, Kelsey Grammer, Jon Voight, and producer Jerry Bruckheimer   the group will abruptly end after reported in-fighting and lack of enthusiasm caused irredeemable dysfunction. Effective immediately, we are going to begin to wind down the 501 c3 organization, bring the Sustaining Membership dues to an end, and do away with the costly infrastructure and the abespal.com website,  the executive director, Jeremy Boreing, told members in an email, a copy of which the Guardian has seen. Today, because we have been successful in creating a community that extends far beyond our events, people just don t feel as much of a need to show up for every speaker or bar night, and fewer people pay the dues that help us maintain that large infrastructure. As the Guardian notes, one of the major reasons the celebrities can t get along is because of the question of Donald Trump. Many of the members can be said to subscribe to the school of  Never Trump , but some of Hollywood s conservative community has been warming to the candidate. Now, as California appears to be the key primary state, the one which will likely decide whether Trump slides easily into the nomination or if the clown show heads to a contested convention, things have gone nuclear. Things only got worse after the group hosted both Trump and his rival Ted Cruz at separate events  neither candidate, apparently, won over everyone.The club itself has been around for a decade, but not a lot is known about its meetings. The members, an enclave of conservatives in  liberal  Hollywood, adopted   and I m not kidding here   the first rule of  Fight Club : Don t talk about The Friends of Abe. Secrecy was strictly enforced, including a ban on pictures and tweets.It s unclear where the battle lines are drawn, but Jon Voight seemed to throw some serious shade at the  Never Trump  club members when in an interview with Breitbart, he said conservatives preventing Trump from being president were suckers. There are many Republicans fighting to keep him from winning the Republican nomination. You know why? Because he has no bull to sell, and everyone will discover the bull most politicians spew out is for their own causes and benefits. I pray all Americans who have seen and felt the meltdown of America with the Obama years, to please fight for Donald Trump. Both Gary Sinise and Kelsey Grammer are die-hard Cruz fans.In many ways, what happened in Hollywood is happening all over the country. The Republican Party has been shredded over Donald Trump s rise and with an alternative as weak as Ted Cruz as the only other option, many long-time Republicans have been stumbling around in what can only be described as a catatonically despondent state. Apparently, even holding a secret meeting with fellow conservatives at a bar became too much to handle as the primary season slouches towards its terrifying conclusion.Featured image via Jason Kempin/Getty Images for Warner Bros.

ON THE INSIDE: Ex-Goldman Sachs Partner Tapped for US Treasury – Joined by Rothschild Linked Commerce Secretary Pick,"Shawn Helton 21st Century WirePresident-elect Donald Trump continues to fill key positions in the White House and in the process, there have already been some controversial cabinet selections. This week the Trump transition team named former Goldman Sachs partner and ex-Soros Fund Management employee (turned Hollywood financier), Steve Mnuchin, as the US Treasury Secretary.The Mnuchin pick, arrives simultaneously as long time billionaire pal of Trump, Wilbur Ross, former head of  Rothschild Inc s bankruptcy advisory business,  becomes Commerce Secretary.While Trump s cabinet nominees for the White House have not yet been set in stone, the two selections mentioned above represent the type of financial syndicate we ve seen in the Washington swamp for many years.  TOO BIG TO FAIL    (Photo Illustration Shawn Helton of 21WIRE)The Financial Crisis & Goldman Sachs In April of 2016, Mnuchin was tasked with being the finance chairman of Trump s 2016 presidential campaign, paving the way for another Wall Street insider to head to the White House.In early November, sources close to CNBC floated the idea that formerly scandal plagued JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, was also up for consideration for US Treasury Secretary before Mnuchin, a long time acquaintance of Trump was officially named.The Mnuchin selection appears at odds with Trump s anti-Wall Street campaign rhetoric, as well as his  drain the swamp  mantra echoed towards the tail end of his presidential run.In fact, the optics of Mnuchin s appointment, seems to strike at the heart of the sub-prime mortgage-backed security lending which led to the 2007-2008 banking crisis.During the economic crash, extremely high risk subprime mortgage-backed securities were crafted from bundled loans. A large amount of these types of mortgages were adjustable rate mortgages, where interests rates would be fixed for a certain number of years, eventually sky rocketing to astronomical increases, subsequently putting the burrower under water as the banks continued to sell these loans to investors. This was a critical aspect that led directly to the foreclosure crisis that swept across the nation in the aftermath of 2008.According to an article featured in the money section of the website of How Stuff Works, we are reminded of the devastating effects of the 2007-2008 crash: In just the month of August 2008, one out of every 416 households in the United States had a new foreclosure filed against it [source: RealtyTrac]. When borrowers stopped making payments on their mortgages, MBSs [mortgage-backed security] began to perform poorly. The average collateralized debt obligation (CDO) lost about half of its value between 2006 and 2008 [source: This American Life]. And since the riskiest (and highest returning) CDOs were comprised of subprime mortgages, they became worthless after the nationwide increase in loan defaults began. Continuing, the article outlines how the hedge-fund Wall Street casino made a fortune by packaging mortgages into bonds to sell to investors: After MBSs hit the financial markets, they were reshaped into a wide variety of financial instruments with different amounts of risk. Interest-only derivatives divided the interest payments made on a mortgage among investors. If interest rates rise, the return is good. If rates fall and homeowners refinance, then the security loses value. In a bold and controversial move, the president-elect s administration by way of Mnuchin, is looking to derail the Dodd-Frank Act, which was put in place in 2010 as a moderate buffer (if at all?) to restrict the type of bank lending that led to the most recent financial crash in 2008. However, naysayers of the  protective act  say it s much to soft on Wall Street, which is in need of tougher restrictions, as any new deregulation could be seen as an attempt to increase the coffers of larger investment banks.In the passage below, The New American expands on this idea through revelations released by the NY Times: According to the text of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the law is supposed  to promote the financial stability of the United States by improving accountability and transparency in the financial system, to end  too big to fail,  [and] to protect the American taxpayer by ending bailouts. However, as is usually the case with federal laws, Dodd-Frank does precisely the opposite.  In fact,  reports the New York Times  Gretchen Morgenson:Dodd-Frank actually widened the federal safety net for big institutions. Under that law, eight more giants were granted the right to tap the Federal Reserve for funding when the next crisis hits. At the same time, those eight may avoid Dodd-Frank measures that govern how we re supposed to wind down institutions that get into trouble.   MONEY MAN    Ex-partner of Goldman Sachs Steve Mnuchin nominated to head the US Treasury. (Image Source: mgtvwten.files.wordpress.com)Although Mnuchin has cited that there s a need to restructure the Dodd-Frank Act because it would bring economic growth to regional banks and potentially open lending up to smaller businesses   there is still a fear that this may be a revolving door for the central banks to profit from as well.Zerohedge provides additional background details regarding Munchin s career in banking: Some more on Mnuchin s background: starting his career in the early 1980s as a trainee at Salomon Brothers before moving to Goldman Sachs in 1985, Mnuchin was front and center for the advent of instruments like collateralized debt obligations and credit default swaps. He has called securitization  an extremely positive development in terms of being able to finance different parts of the economy and different businesses efficiently.  The pitfalls of the financing method came later, he s said.Mnuchin s father, Robert Mnuchin, was a partner at Goldman Sachs in the 1960s. The second-youngest of five siblings, Steven attended the prestigious Riverdale Country School and then Yale University, where his roommate was Edward Lampert, who would go on to become a hedge-fund manager and owner of Sears. In addition to Goldman, Mnuchin also worked at Soros Fund Management, whose founder, George Soros, has funded many left-leaning causes. Where it gets even more bizarre is that Mnuchin has donated frequently to Democrats, including to Clinton and Barack Obama. As a hedge fund manager, Mnuchin is part of a group of business people Trump has excoriated. In August, Trump said hedge fund managers were  getting away with murder  as he touted his proposal to end the so-called carried interest loophole, which gives private equity and hedge fund managers preferential tax treatment. The hedge fund guys didn t build this country,  Trump said at the time on CBS  Face the Nation.  These are guys that shift paper around and they get lucky,  he said.  They are energetic. They are very smart. But a lot of them they are paper-pushers. They make a fortune. They pay no tax. It s ridiculous. Trump s disdain for Wall Street during his campaign run won t soon be forgotten by his supporters as the president-elect s antithetical banking rhetoric will only be magnified by bringing Mnuchin (along with his banking and hedge fund past) into the fold.Mnuchin s confirmation could be a contentious affair (if only for show) due to money made after his purchase of California s IndyMac following the financial crisis. Bloomberg recently stated the following concerning Mnuchin s role in the aftermath of the banking and housing meltdown: In 2009, during the depths of the financial crisis, Mnuchin joined with a group of former Goldman Sachs colleagues and billionaires to buy the remnants of IndyMac, which had collapsed after bingeing on reckless home loans during the frenzy of California s subprime-mortgage boom. They changed the name to OneWest, turned it around and sold the bank for a big gain last year. Continuing, Bloomberg outlines how Mnuchin may have seized on a financial opportunity but stops short of condemning the US Treasury nominee: It s unclear whether OneWest s practices were worse than those of other banks during the financial crisis or how much blame Mnuchin deserves for problems at a financial institution that was troubled before he bought it.Mnuchin declined to comment through a spokesman. But former OneWest Vice Chairman David Fawer said in a statement that the bank inherited loans from IndyMac with  extraordinarily high delinquency rates  and  worked tirelessly to modify thousands of loans to help homeowners through the financial crisis.  The bank has pointed to positive reviews of its foreclosure and loan-modification practices by the Obama Treasury Department, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Interestingly, The Nation reported that Mnuchin purchased the failing IndyMac with an agreement to be  reimbursed  for costs associated to foreclosures that were financed by the company: The Mnuchin group paid FDIC $1.5 billion for the bank, far less than the value of IndyMac s assets. The FDIC was so desperate to unload IndyMac that Mnuchin and his colleagues were able to obtain, as part of the purchase deal, a so-called  shared loss  agreement from the FDIC which reimbursed these billionaires for much of their costs for foreclosing on people unlucky enough to have mortgages from IndyMac.Within a year, the group that the Los Angeles Times called a  billionaires  club of private financiers  had paid themselves dividends of $1.57 billion. In other words, the FDIC took much of the risk by subsidizing the bank s troubled assets, while Mnuchin and his colleagues pocketed the profits. Prior to considering Mnuchin, Trump was said to have considered former CEO of BB&T John Allison, an apparently harsh critic of the Federal Reserve banking system. The following was reported by Business Insider on November 28th: Trump will meet with John Allison, the former CEO of the bank BB&T and of the libertarian think tank the Cato Institute. There have been reports that Allison is being considered for Treasury secretary. Trump s has on the campaign trail questioned the future of the Federal Reserve s political independence, but Allison takes that rhetoric a step further. While running the the Cato Institute, Allison wrote a paper in support of abolishing the Fed.   CABINET PICK    President-elect Donald Trump with fellow billionaire investor Wilbur Ross and vice-president-elect Mike Pence. (Image Source: (mediad.publicbroadcasting) Insiders  & The White HouseJust as Mnuchin s financial behaviour will be under watch, the same will hold true for the newly tapped Commerce Secretary position to be filled by billionaire investor Wilbur Ross.A brief rundown of some of the more controversial aspects of Ross s past were recently published at Forbes: After an getting an MBA from Harvard, he spent two decades heading Rothschild Inc s bankruptcy advisory business, where he represented investors in Trump s failing Taj Mahal casino in the early 1990s. Ross and Carl Icahn convinced bondholders to strike a deal with Trump, who some investors wanted to push out, which allowed Trump to retain control of the property. Continuing, the article described how Ross invested in distressed coal companies in addition to banking opportunities: During the recession Ross targeted another struggling industry: banking. He invested in troubled banks in England, Greece and Cyprus. He was also part of a group of investors that acquired a 35% stake in the Bank of Ireland during the height of Europe s 2011 debt crisis. He sold the last of his stake in 2014, nearly tripling his initial investment. Ross has also reportedly bet hundreds of millions of dollars on downtrodden oil and gas firms since the price of oil began to slide more than two years ago. Incidentally, Ross has maintained a tough public position on so-called free trade deals like NAFTA and the soon-to-be defunct Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) but real questions still remain about his financial acquisitions during distressed times   is he a risk taking business visionary or a financial vulture?Ross has denied being a business liquidator for profit and states that he has worked to rebuild failing businesses.Whatever the case may be, Mnuchin and Ross have touted big corporate tax relief and large tax cuts to the middle class in the US. However, the public should be wary of their dealings with those on Wall Street and any new reform legislation aimed at deregulation.Banking deregulation and reform directed by Wall Street or one of their ilk, should be treated with great suspicion if history is any lesson Below is another look at a passage from a report I complied prior to the election entitled  PARTNERS IN CRIME: Goldman Sachs, The Clintons & Wall Street : In one of the most significant financial rulings in the modern era, the Clinton presidency gave big banks like Goldman Sachs the skeleton key to the kingdom by deregulating the investment banking system almost entirely.The Clinton/Goldman Sachs/Wall Street partnership was fully forged after the removal of the Glass-Steagall Act, which banking luminaries cynically named the  Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999  officially titled the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.  The original Glass-Steagall was a depression-age four-part provision under the Bank Act of 1933 that strictly prohibited securities activities that could be harmful to investors   the same sort of rogue speculating and paper fiat fraud which triggered the Great Depression (1929-1941). In fact, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act which repealed Glass-Steagall, opened the door for the  shadow banking  realm outside of regulatory oversight which led to a much higher trading risk, as banks became more interlinked.Simply put: Clinton s repeal of Glass-Steagell removed the firewall between speculative investment banking and regular high street retail and consumer banking   which exposed everyone to toxic, subprime ponzi schemes and fake paper products being pushed around the globe by the banking elite   which ultimately caused the global economy to crash in 2008. All that can be laid at the feet of one William Jefferson Clinton. And Hillary still claims that,  My husband did so well with the economy.  Really?In a cross-posted article featured at Huffington Post, Nomi Prins underscored the complicit nature of Wall Street and Washington after the removal of tighter bank regulations under the Clinton administration during the 1990 s: To grasp the dangers that the Big Six banks (JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley) presently pose to the financial stability of our nation and the world, you need to understand their history in Washington, starting with the Clinton years of the 1990s. Alliances established then (not exclusively with Democrats, since bankers are bipartisan by nature) enabled these firms to become as politically powerful as they are today and to exert that power over an unprecedented amount of capital. Rest assured of one thing: their past and present CEOs will prove as critical in backing a Hillary Clinton presidency as they were in enabling her husband s years in office. Prins herself was a former managing director at Goldman Sachs, senior managing director at Bear Stearns, as well as having worked as a senior strategist at the now defunct investment banking firm Lehman Brothers. Following the financial crash in 2007-2008, Prins blew the whistle on the banking world in a book entitled  It Takes a Pillage: Behind the Bonuses, Bailouts, and Backroom Deals from Washington to Wall Street. Prins has become an advocate for the reinstatement of the Glass-Steagall Act since departing from the investment banking world.The media outlet Common Dreams described the merger between Citicorp and Travelers Group (becoming Citigroup), which was dubbed the  Citi-Travelers Act  on Capitol Hill. It was a conglomeration that went hand in hand with the Clinton administration s influence on banking deregulation marked by the repeal of Glass-Steagall: Then, in 1998, in an act of corporate civil disobedience, Citicorp and Travelers Group announced they were merging. Such a combination of banking and insurance companies was illegal under the Bank Holding Company Act, but was excused due to a loophole that provided a two-year review period of proposed mergers. The merger was premised on the expectation that Glass-Steagall would be repealed. Citigroup s co-chairs Sandy Weill and John Reed led a swarm of industry executives and lobbyists who trammeled the halls of Congress to make sure a deal was cut. At the time, it was the largest financial merger even though it was technically illegal, as stated by the former Bankers of America CEO Kenneth Guenther. In 1999, after 12 attempts in 25 years,  Congress passed the Financial Services Modernization Act, which led to the repeal of Glass-Steagall. Both of Trump s finance picks arrive with the all to familiar baggage witnessed within the beltway swamp   and if Mnuchin s and Ross s questionable pasts are to be accepted wholesale, it s difficult to imagine insiders of their pedigree turning over a new leaf for the  everyday man. The following is a screen shot of a statement released by former Goldman CEO and former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson regarding the Mnuchin pick. As a reminder, Paulson presided over the financial crisis and was US Treasury Secretary from 2006-2009. In 2008, amid a flurry of backlash, he authorized a $700 million dollar Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) banking bailout, masking the derivatives scam pulled by Wall Street s top brass:In 2010, CBS News cataloged the long relationship of Goldman Sachs and government,  revealing at least four dozen former employees, lobbyists or advisers at the highest reaches of power both in Washington and around the world. It s also worth noting that White House adviser Steve Bannon and adviser Anthony Scaramucci have also worked for banking behemoth Goldman Sachs.Will Washington see more Wall Street friendly policies under Trump?

" Trump Doubles Down Via The Law, Moves To Protect White Supremacists From Law Enforcement","Donald Trump is a racist. We ve always known that. He has been repeatedly sued by the Department of Justice for refusing to rent apartments to black and brown tenets, and he ran an openly racist campaign in his bid for the White House, regularly retweeting and playing footsie with the Alt-Right, white supremacists, neo-Nazis, Ku Klux Klan members, and other various assorted bigots. Now that he is squatting in the Oval Office, this man is more dangerous than ever in this direction.We all watched his disgraceful and terrifying defense of neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and Klan members on Tuesday. Now, Trump is prepared to take his sympathy for Nazis and other white supremacists a step further and shield them from prosecution for their domestic terrorism. John Cohn, a former Homeland Security terrorism analyst, says of the situation: When you are a white supremacist and you hear the language coming out of the current administration, you sit back and you say,  Those people believe in what we believe in; they have my back.  That s what concerns law enforcement the most right now. This is especially concerning, considering that the Department of Justice is explicitly focusing not on homegrown white supremacists, according to Vice News, but on ISIS-like groups instead. In fact, the Trump Department of Justice is not concerned with white supremacists at all. Cohn goes on to say: As it relates to preventing mass-casualty attacks, we know what we need to do. This guy in Charlottesville [James Alex Fields Jr.] fits the behavior profile. His family had called the police before. Of course, James Alex Fields Jr. is the young neo-Nazi who rammed a car into a crowd of protesters, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer and wounding many others. He was known to idolize Adolf Hitler and was pretty much an out-front Nazi.The racist Trump Administration is literally endangering lives. This refusal to go after white supremacists, and indeed their open support of them, is beyond dangerous. It also means local law enforcement is on their own when dealing with this escalating threat because there will be no help to be had from the federal government. All of these fascists and racists need to be removed from office before more people die at the hands of Trump s Nazi followers.You can read the entire disturbing report here, at Vice News.Featured image via screen capture from Twitter",News,"August 16, 2017",2393
 Donald Trump Is Clearly Panicking; Avoiding The People Who Voted For Him,"Donald Trump s presidency is spiraling out of control and Dear Leader appears to be holed up in the White House, avoiding even the people who still support him.Immediately following his return from the G20 summit in Europe this month, even his daily schedule went completely blank as he retreated behind the walls of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Trump has at least added some daily events to his schedule in recent days, but he s not venturing outside.It was Vice President Mike Pence   not Trump   who left the White House Tuesday and spoke publicly and at length about the Republicans  health care bill in the wake of its Senate collapse, not Trump. Unlike Trump, Pence has been maintaining a very public profile in recent days.Source: Share BlueIn the last month, when Trump wasn t leaving the country, pretty much the only reason he left the White House was to go play golf or to watch golf, which he did on June 24, 25, and 30, as well as July 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 14, 15, and 16. Outside of playing golf or promoting his own business properties, however, Trump is clearly in hiding.To be fair, Trump isn t completely MIA. He did a photo op in a firetruck (just like a big boy) on Monday and he s spent a lot of time on his golf course. But when it comes to using his legendary (in his own mind) negotiating skills to help save the repeal and replacement of Obamacare (one of his top campaign promises), the Deal Artist offered little to nothing.While this is pretty much unprecedented, it signals something major is happening within the White House. Since taking office, he s soothed his fragile ego by holding campaign style rallies in front of fawning fans. The last one he held, which was his last state-side public appearance, was nearly a month ago. While the fans still exist, Trump is even avoiding them. Instead, he s presumably seeking comfort in Kentucky Fried Chicken and chocolate cake in front of an increasingly incredulous Fox News.This isn t particularly surprising. Trump has a difficult time in situations that don t offer him adulation. He refuses to make a state visit to the UK until Prime Minister Theresa May can guarantee the nearly universally despised America leader a warm reception.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"July 19, 2017",2247
" Trump Is Too Incompetent To Handle Disaster On An Island, But Obama Handled One Just Fine","Trump has spent an awful lot of time whining about Puerto Rico being an island with a devastated infrastructure, claiming that s the reason our relief effort has been so slow and disorganized: The response and recovery effort probably has never been seen for something like this. This is an island surrounded by water. Big water. Ocean water. He also said: This is a thing called the Atlantic Ocean. This is tough stuff. Gee, these complaints are reminiscent of when he said nobody knew healthcare could be so complicated. With this administration,  It s really difficult, we re doing all we can,  is code for,  I don t really care about this at all unless I can find a way to make myself look good here. But are we really having problems because Puerto Rico is an island, making it different than Florida and Texas, which were also devastated by hurricanes? Current evidence suggests otherwise: Supplies are just sitting in shipping containers there because there are too few truck drives, and too many blocked roads. One has to wonder why we don t have more personnel there helping the Puerto Rican government to clear the roads so that supply lines can reopen and we can help get those supplies to where they re most needed. One person even said that the personnel who are there just seem to be modeling their uniforms. That suggests we have a lot of people who don t know what they re supposed to be doing on the ground there. That would be a failure on our part, not Puerto Rico s.But then there s how Obama handled natural disasters on islands. In 2010, Haiti, which is practically next door to Puerto Rico in the Caribbean (not the Atlantic Ocean), suffered an absolutely devastating earthquake. Despite the fact that we had no warning for that quake (we had plenty of warning for Maria), President Obama mobilized our military  as if it were going to war,  according to the Washington Post. Within two days, we had 8,000 troops on their way to the disaster-stricken country.In less than two weeks, we had 22,000 troops on the ground; 300 military helicopters dropping supplies, and 33 Navy ships aiding the relief effort. Eight days after Maria swept over Puerto Rico, we only had 4,400 troops working relief there, along with 1,000 members of the Coast Guard. Only 50 choppers were working to deliver supplies.The morning after Haiti s quake, Obama told the military that they were  going to respond in Port-au-Prince robustly and immediately, and that gave the whole government clarity of purpose.  Rajiv Shah, who led USAID when the earthquake struck, said: We were able to move more quickly in a foreign country, and with no warning because it was an earthquake, than a better-equipped agency was able to do in a domestic territory. The Posse Comitatus Act places limits on what the military can do in a state or territory, and by contrast, Haiti is a foreign country. Our military response would be considerably different just because of that. But there were over 17,000 troops from 23 states on the ground in Florida after Irma. And the administration keeps saying that Puerto Rico isn t asking for very much, despite residents running out of food, drinkable water and other supplies, and San Juan s mayor breaking down over the Trump administration saying the response has been good.There are complicating factors, it s true. But this is a level of apathy and ineptitude we can t have from the White House when responding to disasters, particularly those where people are dying. Obama showed that being an island is a lot less of a factor in relief efforts than this administration is claiming.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla and Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"September 29, 2017",3673
 Trump Is LITERALLY Kicking Off His 2020 Re-Election Campaign In Florida This Weekend,"For the third time in a row, Trump will head down to Florida for the weekend because he can t stand the White House. However, it seems that this particular weekend vacay is different: It s a rally at Orlando International Airport, similar to the ones he held during his campaign. He s even got a neat little graphic on his Twitter announcement, which also reads the way the ads for his campaign stops read:Join me in Florida this Saturday at 5pm for a rally at the Orlando-Melbourne International Airport!

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2017Now, we already knew that Trump s advisers were trying to figure out a way to allow him to keep holding rallies so he could stroke his ego while in office. That s what his so-called  Thank-You  tour was all about. However, it seems that this one is a little different. White House press who ve spoken to Spicer about it are saying the following:Spicer says Trump rally in FL Saturday is a  campaign  event. So the 2020 campaign has begun.  Jim Acosta (@Acosta) February 15, 2017Spicer on POTUS event on Saturday in FL:  It s being run by the campaign  Zeke Miller (@ZekeJMiller) February 15, 2017It s a campaign event, and it s being paid for by the campaign, although speculation says otherwise:This means that Trump s campaign must pay some of the costs for Air Force One, travel and lodging for aides.

He filed a letter with the Federal Election Commission saying he meets the candidacy threshold for 2020 on the day he was inaugurated, and now he s holding campaign events. And Spicer is saying the campaign will pay for them. The campaign will pay for use of Air Force One and lodging for the Secret Service and all his aides? Sure.But more than that, this is another way for him to avoid real work, and possibly to distract from the scandals mounting in the White House. He hates the business of being the president because he can t do what he wants, when he wants and how he wants. He can t be a dictator, and he can t tolerate people actually telling him he s wrong. But he can hold these rallies full of cheering people who admire him and hold him up as a god who s right about everything.This isn t normal. This is terrifying.Featured image by Mark Wallheiser via Getty Images",News,"February 15, 2017",2777
WOW! KY Dem House Speaker Makes Insane Speech Following Crushing Defeat In Gov Race [Video],"State Reps Forced To Stand Awkwardly In BackgroundAt one point it appears as though someone approaches the two State Representatives who appear to be trapped behind the rambling, incoherent train wreck, Kentucy House Speaker and Democrat, Greg Stumbo and offers them an opportunity to get off the stage. This wealth accumulation in America has to cease.   Kentucky Republicans had a very good election day. Matt Bevin defeated Democrat Jack Conway to become only the second Republican Kentucky governor in four decades. Jenean Hampton won her quest for lieutenant governor, becoming the commonwealth s first African-American to hold a statewide office.  Rising Democratic star  State Auditor, Adam Edelen, was ousted by Republican state Rep. Mike Harmon, despite raising nearly $900,000 to Harmon s $37,000.Democrats held on to some seats, but the defeats were crushing in part because Conway was ahead in polling up to election day. With so many Democrats ousted from office or unable to win their campaigns, Kentucky House Speaker Greg Stumbo is one of the top-ranking Democrats still standing.He gave a speech that was striking for its odd content and rambling delivery. Flanked by state Reps. Martha Jane King and Jeff Greer, Stumbo discussed his thoughts on the political affiliation of Jesus and his view on what Scripture really is and how it influences politics. And the other thing I know is that if in fact the Bible is a book of parables, like I believe it is, think about this: Mary did not ride an elephant into Bethlehem that night,  he said to a restrained crowd.[ ] For entire story:The Federalist   h/t:Weasel ZippersHmmmm .I wonder where he got the idea America is beginning to think of the Democrats as the  Godless party? Maybe Conway missed the last DNC convention where the members voted to remove God from the platform:And then of course, there is Reverend Wright who preached hate and anything but the truth about God s love for all of his people to Barack Hussein Obama (the ultimate Democrat Community Organizer) for roughly 20 years: ",Government News,"Nov 5, 2015",2061
 Hillary’s New Ad Brilliantly Uses Those Who Have Endorsed Trump Against Him (VIDEO),"Since the start of Donald Trump s campaign for President of the United States, there s been a heavy amount of racism. For most sane-minded individuals, this racism was obvious and purposeful. Many have been speaking out and standing up against such a blatant disregard for those who have immigrated to the United States from Latin American countries.Through most of Trump s campaign, many of his fellow Republicans have just chosen to ignore the obvious racism, because it became clear that the Republican base of voters wanted this rhetoric as Trump s popularity rose and pushed him into the presumptive nominee spot.It would seem, however, that Trump s latest remarks surrounding the judge that is to preside over the Trump University case, is too much for even high-ranking Republicans who have backed him for the presidency. Trump doesn t believe a judge of Mexican descent should preside over his case. Not only that, he doesn t want a Muslim either. And what next? No women, gay individuals, or any people of color whatsoever?It s become obvious Trump wants a white male America and he s not even hiding it.Noticing the clear disdain for Trump s remarks by his Republican allies was the Hillary Clinton campaign, and they brilliantly put together an ad using all of their words against the presumptive nominee.It may become the most damaging ad yet, as Trump may have finally gone too far for even his own party, with Newt Gingrich, a man who has been rumored to be a potential VP for Trump, saying: This is one of the worst mistakes Trump has made. Watch the brilliant ad here:.@realdonaldtrump s bigoted comments about a Latino judge are so disgusting, even other Republicans are offended.https://t.co/3CEBq2jsDh  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) June 6, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",News,"June 6, 2016",1807
 Donald Trump’s Alma Mater Just Told Him To Go F*ck Himself,"Donald Trump likes to brag that he attended the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, but while he is proud of that, the students and faculty are embarrassed that he is an alumni.In an open letter, students and faculty both past and present condemned Trump for his hateful and bigoted rhetoric and expressed outrage that he is humiliating the school by associating it with his ignorance and intolerance and rejected his use of the school name in his campaign.Here s the full letter via Medium:At the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, students are taught to represent the highest levels of respect and integrity. We are taught to embrace humility and diversity. We can understand why, in seeking America s highest office, you have used your degree from Wharton to promote and lend legitimacy to your candidacy.As a candidate for President, and now as the presumptive GOP nominee, you have been afforded a transformative opportunity to be a leader on national and international stages and to make the Wharton community even prouder of our school and values.However, we have been deeply disappointed in your candidacy.We, proud students, alumni, and faculty of Wharton, are outraged that an affiliation with our school is being used to legitimize prejudice and intolerance. Although we do not aim to make any political endorsements with this letter, we do express our unequivocal stance against the xenophobia, sexism, racism, and other forms of bigotry that you have actively and implicitly endorsed in your campaign. The Wharton community is a diverse community. We are immigrants and children of immigrants, people of color, Muslims, Jews, women, people living with or caring for those with disabilities, and members of the LGBTQ community. In other words, we represent the groups that you have repeatedly denigrated, as well as their steadfast friends, family, and allies.We recognize that we are fortunate to be educated at Wharton, and we are committed to using our opportunity to make America and the world a better place for everyone. We are dedicated to promoting inclusion not only because diversity and tolerance have been repeatedly proven to be valuable assets to any organization s performance, but also because we believe in mutual respect and human dignity as deeply held values. Your insistence on exclusion and scapegoating would be bad for business and bad for the American economy. An intolerant America is a less productive, less innovative, and less competitive America.We, the undersigned Wharton students, alumni, and faculty, unequivocally reject the use of your education at Wharton as a platform for promoting prejudice and intolerance. Your discriminatory statements are incompatible with the values that we are taught and we teach at Wharton, and we express our unwavering commitment to an open and inclusive American society.In addition, the authors of the letter spoke to NBC about their decision to write it. It was important for us to speak out against Trump because, as we have seen in many moments throughout history, silence is an act of complicity. This open letter speaks on behalf of Wharton students, alumni and faculty who wish to speak out against hate and stand in solidarity with all members of our diverse community   both at Wharton and across America. In short, Donald Trump just received a giant middle finger from the school and it s a safe bet that past faculty regret that he was ever allowed to step foot in their classrooms. Because every time Trump opens his mouth he makes it hard to believe that he could have ever actually earned a degree anywhere in the first place.Featured Image: Mark Lyons/Getty Images",News,"July 9, 2016",3688
 WATCH: What Trump Just Said About 9/11 Proves Republicans Still Don’t Get It,"Sprinting towards a likely win in New York s Republican primary, Donald Trump made the kind of flub about the September 11th terrorist attacks that would cause heartache for most other campaigns but is sort of what we ve now come to expect from the reality TV star turned presidential frontrunner.Appearing at a campaign event in Buffalo, NY, Trump referred to the 9/11 attacks as  7/11. Donald Trump, who has made his advocacy for New York City after the 9/11 attacks central to his candidacy, accidentally referred to it on Monday as 7/11   the ubiquitous convenience store. I wrote this out, and it s very close to my heart,  he said at the outset of his remarks on Buffalo on Monday evening.  Because I was down there and I watched our police and our firemen down at 7/11, down at the World Trade Center right after it came down. And I saw the greatest people I ve ever seen in action. This weird flub of course comes from the candidate who has claimed that he has a photographic memory and bragged a few months ago that he had  the best  words:I m telling you, I used to use the word incompetent. Now I just call them stupid. I went to an Ivy League school. I m very highly educated. I know words, I have the best words but there is no better word than stupid. Right?But Trump s respect for what happened on 9/11 has always been about an inch thick, despite his long time association with New York City.A conservative anti-Trump PAC aired an ad showing that Trump exploited a loophole in the law to access $150,000 in funds targeted towards small businesses who had suffered due to the attacks, even though   as he has gone on about at length   Trump has hundreds of millions of dollars at his disposal, along with businesses (well the ones who haven t gone bankrupt) generating considerable income.Featured image via YouTube",News,"April 18, 2016",1830
 Ted Cruz Awkwardly Explains Why Texas Should Have Federal Relief Money But Not Victims Of Hurricane Sandy,"U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz was against federal aid for natural disasters until he was for it. The Texas Senator voted against Federal funding for victims of Hurricane Sandy, the deadliest and most destructive hurricane in the Atlantic in 2012, but now he wants funds after Hurricane Harvey barreled down on his state. At least 14 people have died after Harvey hit Texas. More than 3,000 people have been rescued as responders work around the clock in devastating conditions.During a press conference on Monday, Cruz said that Trump has pledged  whatever the state needs  for water-soaked Texas. But, just after that presser, Cruz was in the awkward position of having to defend his position to MSNBC s Katy Tur on the 2012 Hurricane Sandy relief package, calling it  filled with unrelated pork. There is time for political sniping later,  Cruz said without one bit of irony or acknowledgement of his hypocrisy. It s not really political sniping, senator,  Tur shot back.  These are people who needed money and who needed funding right after that storm, I covered those people. Many of them, just like those in Houston, lost absolutely everything they owned. Cruz told Tur that hurricane relief is a  vital, central role  of the federal government and should continue to be for a long time. The problem with that particular bill is it became a $50 billion bill that was filled with unrelated pork,  Cruz said. Two-thirds of that bill had nothing to do with Sandy,  he continued.  And what I said then and still believe now is that it s not right for politicians to exploit a disaster and people who are hurting to pay for their own political wish list. Disaster relief needs to be focused on the victims of disaster relief, and I supported that for Sandy, disaster relief there, and I would support that anywhere there s a major disaster without getting distracted by political, unnecessary pork spending,  he added.The Washington Post begs to differ with Cruz:The Congressional Research Service issued a comprehensive report on the provisions, and it s clear that virtually all of it was related to the damage caused by Sandy. There may have been some pork in an earlier Senate version, but many of those items were removed before final passage. There were also some items that appear to have been misunderstood.Regardless, Ted Cruz voted against it but now he wants all that delicious disaster relief money for his state. And, Texas should get that money asap. The victims of Sandy should have, too.Image via screen capture. ",News,"August 29, 2017",2518
WATCH: MITT ROMNEY DOESN’T Think Roy Moore Deserves Fair Treatment In Questionable 40-Year-Old Sex Assault Allegations…Has Romney Already Forgotten What Harry Reid’s LIE Did To His Campaign?,"Yesterday, former GOP Republican presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, came out with one of his most incredible statements to date. After months of silence, Mitt tweeted about the 36-40-year-old sexual misconduct allegations against Alabama s Republican candidate for Senator, Judge Roy Moore.In his tweet, Mitt told Americans that Judge Roy Moore was not entitled to a fair investigation and that Moore should  step aside . Romney tweeted:  Innocent until proven guilty is for criminal convictions, not elections. I believe Leigh Corfman. Her account is too serious to ignore. Moore is unfit for office and should step aside. Innocent until proven guilty is for criminal convictions, not elections. I believe Leigh Corfman. Her account is too serious to ignore. Moore is unfit for office and should step aside.  Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) November 10, 2017Mitt has remained mostly dormant since he went off on his anti-Trump rant just before the Presidential election.  The last time we saw Mitt, was when he was in Trump Towers, pandering to President-elect Trump for a job in his administration. It appears that, much like John McCain, the anti-conservative, bitter, former GOP presidential candidate just can t keep his disdain for Republicans, who are unafraid to openly fight for their convictions, to himself. Perhaps Mitt s nasty remarks were intended to help ingratiate himself with liberal voters in Utah, as he allegedly is preparing to run for the retiring Republican Senator Orin Hatch s seat. It s also quite possible that after the United States watched Mitt give up the race after he pummeled Barack Obama in their first presidential debate, that Mitt just doesn t  have the stomach for Republicans who actually fight back when they re being attacked by the left.Is it possible that Mitt has already forgotten the lie that Harry Reid pushed out to the voters only months before the election about Mitt not paying taxes for the past 1w years?On July 12, 2012, Senator Harry Reid stood before his comrades on the Senate floor and told a bald-faced lie about then-candidate Mitt Romney not paying his taxes for the past 12 years. Reid knowingly lied to Congress telling them Mitt Romney s father set the precedent for presidential candidates allowing the American public to view their taxes, but Mitt Romney can t do that because he s paid no taxes for 12 years. His father, George Romney, set the precedent that people running for president would file their tax returns, let everybody look at them. But Mitt Romney can t do that because he s basically paid no taxes in the prior 12 years. Watch:Two years later, Harry Reid was later questioned by CNN s Dana Bash about the lie he told to his fellow Senators. His response could not have been more arrogant or disrespectful to the American voters who based their votes for Barack Obama, based on a lie that Senator Harry Reid told only 4 months before the election.So, tell us again Mitt, how it doesn t matter if a political candidate is guilty of charges levied against him by the left, that their only response must be to  step down  if they re accused of wrongdoing.Yesterday, it was revealed that at least one of Judge Roy Moore s accusers was deeply involved in Democrat politics, is virulently anti-Trump, and has been openly pushing for Judge Roy Moore s Democrat opponent Doug Ross on her personal Facebook page.It was also revealed that Stephanie McCrummen, one of the co-writers of the Washington Post article that smeared Moore with 4 unproven allegations has a history of  faking  things to benefit herself (read more HERE). More and more details continue to emerge about Roy Moore s alleged  victims .Stay tuned, for those of us who are sick and tired of watching Republicans get kicked around and watching their careers being ruined, this isn t over yet ",left-news,"Nov 11, 2017",3830
COLLEGE SOCIALIST GROUP Incites Children To Yell: “Kill Donald Trump!” [VIDEO],"The Knights for Socialism held an event where they allowed students to bash Pinatas with the faces of President Donald J. Trump, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and presidential advisor Steve Bannon.East Orlando Post obtained exclusive footage from UCF College Republican Douglas Mactye, which includes disturbing content involving an elementary to middle school aged student yelling  Kill Trump.  The young children were being encouraged to hit the Pinatas by members of the Knights for Socialism for the duration. The  Killl Trump  segment can be seen during the ninth minute of the video:The footage also shows a bearded man wearing an  Antifa International  sweatshirt, presumably monitoring the event for the Knights for Socialism. Antifa has been responsible for violent Anti-Trump riots across the country that have resulted in millions of dollars in damage, vicious beatings of Trump supporters, and even shutting down Milo Yiannopoulos  campus talk at Berkeley.In an interview to campus based mainstream news source Knight News, Knights for Socialism president Dylan J. Tyer claimed the event was not negative at all and completely welcoming.  There s been no negativity by any means but definitely a lot of interest and a lot of good conversations with people.  However, Tyer is clearly seen in our exclusive footage yelling about  Beating Pete Sessions  face in,  among other violent profanities.Justin York, a UCF alumnus who once served as Chairman of the UCF College Republicans labeled the event as  extremely hypocritical  and a  red flag.

FLINT RESIDENTS TOLD TO PAY BILLS FOR POISON WATER Or They May Have Their Children Taken Away,"You seriously can t make this up. This Democrat run city is officially out of control. We reported before that the EPA knew about this crisis long before they told anyone, yet the media and the Left continues to try to pin the blame squarely on Michigan s Republican Governor. This latest threat is just another  black eye  for the officials handling the Flint, MI water crisis As the water crisis in Flint deepens, it is becoming apparent that the effects of the lead-infested water are not just a health hazard, but the situation has the potential of ruining many more lives outside of the poison issue. There is no denying that the water in Flint is undrinkable and that it is contaminated with lead and other substances, and it is clear that the government of Flint is responsible for the problem.However, the city s government continues to charge people for the poison water and then threatening to foreclose their home or take their children if they refuse to pay. Michigan law states that parents are neglectful if they do not have running water in their home, and if they chose not to pay for water they can t drink anyway, then they could be guilty of child endangerment.Activists in Flint say that some residents have already received similar threats from the government if they refuse to pay their bills.Flint residents have recently filed two class action lawsuits calling for all water bills since April of 2014 to be considered null and void because of the fact that the water was poisonous. We are seeking for the court to declare that all the bills that have been issued for usage of water invalid because the water has not been fit for its intended purpose,  said Trachelle Young, one of the attorneys bringing the lawsuit, in court. Essentially, the residents have been getting billed for water that they cannot use. Because of that, we do not feel that is a fair way to treat the residents,  Young added.Recent estimates have indicated that it could take up to 15 years and over $60 million to fix the problem, and the residents will be essentially forced to live there until the problem is solved. Despite the fact that the issue is obviously the government s responsibility, they have made it illegal for people to sell their homes because of the fact that they are known to carry contaminated water. Meanwhile, residents are still left to purchase bottled water on their own, in addition to paying their water bill.Although this problem is finally getting national media attention in Flint, they aren t the only city with contaminated water supplies. In fact, a recent report published by The Guardian showed that public water supplies across the country were experiencing similar issues.This crisis highlights the many dangers of allowing the government to maintain a monopoly on the water supply and calls attention to the fact that decentralized solutions to water distribution should be a goal that we start working towards.Via: DC Clothesline",politics,"Jan 25, 2016",2969
NEW REPORT: OBAMAPHONE Program Stashed $9 BILLION In Private Bank Accounts…Exposes Massive Windfall For Phone Companies,"Who could forget the  Obamaphone Lady  from Cleveland, OH, who unashamedly told an interviewer she was voting for Obama because all minorities in Cleveland get a free Obamaphone from Obama, and  He s gonna do more!  She actually woke up and admitted that she, and other minorities had been played by Obama in a follow-up video at the bottom of the page.The controversial  Obamaphone  program, which pays for cellphones for the poor, is rife with fraud, according to a new government report released Thursday that found more than a third of enrollees may not even be qualified.Known officially as the Lifeline Program, the phone giveaway became a symbol of government waste in the previous administration. Now a new report from the Government Accountability Office bears out those concerns.The report, requested by Sen. Claire McCaskill, Missouri Democrat, also says the program has stashed some $9 billion in assets in private bank accounts rather than with the federal treasury, further increasing risks and depriving taxpayers of the full benefit of that money. A complete lack of oversight is causing this program to fail the American taxpayer   everything that could go wrong is going wrong,  said Mrs. McCaskill, ranking Democrat on the Senate s chief oversight committee and who is a former state auditor in Missouri. We re currently letting phone companies cash a government check every month with little more than the honor system to hold them accountable, and that simply can t continue,  she said. The program, run by the Federal Communications Commission, predates President Obama, but it gained attention during his administration when recipients began to associate the free phone with other benefits he doled out to the poor.   Washington TimesThe Daily Caller reported:A massive portion of Obamaphone recipients are receiving the benefit after lying on their applications, according to a new 90-page report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO).An undercover sting operation showed ineligible applications were approved 63 percent of the time, and a review that found that 36 to 65 percent of beneficiaries in various categories had lied in easily-detectable ways but were approved anyway.The fraud reached unheard-of proportions because the Federal Communications Commission let the task of screening for eligibility fall to phone companies that profit off of enrolling as many people as possible.GAO undercover investigators applied for free government phones 19 times using criteria that should have been rejected, and  we were approved to receive Lifeline services by 12 of the 19 Lifeline providers using fictitious eligibility documentation. All someone has to do to apply for free cell phone service is say that they are on another welfare program, such as food stamps or disability, known as SSI.When Congress considered reforms, phone companies took out daily full-page ads in publications read by Capitol Hill staffers. The wife of the CEO of TracFone, the largest beneficiary of Obamaphones, was a mega-fundraiser for former President Barack Obama.The cause of the fraud rates, shocking even by federal government standards, was always clear: The FCC allowed companies with a profit motive to sign up as many people as possible to determine eligibility.Phone companies swooped into housing projects in vans with neon flashing lights to register users. A woman approached by one such representative outside of a welfare office told The Daily Caller News Foundation Investigative Group the man encouraged her to enroll her two-year-old.The companies weren t checking eligibility, and the FCC wasn t ensuring they did or punishing those who didn t. Additionally, the FCC failed to provide many companies with the intra-government databases that would give them the ability to perform some checks, the GAO found.The Obamaphone Lady aka Michelle Dowry made an appearance on Alex Jones  show where she admitted to finally waking up, as she discovered that Barack Obama s presidency was a giant hoax. The only thing that Michele and the rest of the the minority community Obama promised to help got during his 8 years in office was a tax-payer funded  free  phone:",politics,"Jul 5, 2017",4192
HILLARY BASHED TRUMP For Saying He May Not Accept Election Results: Video Shows Her Telling CNN Host Gore Shouldn’t Have Conceded 2000 Election Results,"Last night during the third debate, FOX News  Chris Wallace asked Donald J. Trump if he would accept the election results? With multiple stories of voter fraud being committed by Democrats across the nation and a video (see below) proving that the DNC and Hillary s campaign are coordinating with criminals to plan massive voter fraud, why would Trump make a statement that he was willing to accept the outcome of the election regardless of how it may be won? Hillary chastised Trump for having VERY LEGITIMATE concerns over the potential for voter fraud to swing the election.

Rebecca Ballhaus (@rebeccaballhaus) December 8, 2017Legal Insurrection  CNN originally reported an email from Trump Jr. was sent 10 days later, a factual inaccuracy that led to a false timeline and essentially, fake news. The timeline is crucial because it proves Trump Jr. was not trading unknown information, but that someone was alerting him to information already made public. Despite claims to the contrary, Trump Jr. was not aware (as far as records prove) ofCNN has published a CORRECTION and updated this story.

The story suggested that the individual may simply have been trying to flag the campaign to already public documents.CNN has now obtained a copy of the email, which lists September 14 as the date sent and contains a decryption key that matches what WikiLeaks had tweeted out the day before.After obtaining the emails, the WaPo corrected the record:A 2016 email sent to President Trump and top aides pointed the campaign to hacked documents from the Democratic National Committee that had already been made public by the group WikiLeaks a day earlier.The email   sent the afternoon of Sept. 14, 2016   noted that  Wikileaks has uploaded another (huge 678 mb) archive of files from the DNC  and included a link and a  decryption key,  according to a copy obtained by The Washington Post.The writer, who said his name was Michael J. Erickson and described himself as the president of an aviation management company, sent the message to the then-Republican nominee as well as his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and other top advisers.Legal Insurrection tweeted about CNN s latest VeryFakeNews story:Washington Post proving that CNN scoop was fake news.

 Trump Humiliated As DACA Decision Practically Kills His Presidency (DETAILS),"As we saw with his Muslim travel ban as well as his attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare, every time Donald Trump puts forth one of his disastrous ideas, it blows up in his face and delivers a devastating blow to his already failing presidency.Each time Trump introduces an unpopular policy or idea, his already historically low approval rating takes another nosedive. This week, Trump only managed to make things worse for himself when he decided to end former President Obama s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) program. Here s the problem   most Americans disagree with him.According to a recent survey from Morning Consult/Politico, almost 80% (76% to be exact) of Americans do not believe that Dreamers (the undocumented immigrants that were brought into the United States illegally as kids) should be forced to return to their countries. The majority of Americans are far more humane than Trump, and believe that these immigrants should have the opportunity to become citizens, as most have been productive members and have contributed greatly to American society.Trump is especially in trouble because his decision to end DACA only offers more proof that he is a racist a**hole. As MSNBC s Joy Reid perfectly pointed out, there is  no economic, national security or social cohesion rationale  for ending DACA: Trump might say that he has  great love  for the immigrants that are living in America, but his decision proves the exact opposite. Trump wants to strip Dreamers of the lives and progress they have made for themselves in this country and force them to return to countries they are unfamiliar with, where they will have nothing.With this decision, Trump is not only screwing himself over by killing his presidency, but he is also basically putting the GOP in great danger in future elections by excluding one of the fastest-growing voting demographics. Trump is sinking the Republican Party   and his presidency   at record speed.Featured image via video screen capture ",News,"September 6, 2017",2000
" Republican VP Candidate Makes Trump Proud, Uses Racial Slur To Describe Undocumented Immigrants","Donald Trump is more than likely leaning toward picking retired Lt. General Michael Flynn as his vice-presidential running mate after this.During an interview on The Week with guest host Martha Raddatz, Flynn referred to undocumented immigrants as  illegals. Flynn is currently on Trump s shortlist of possible running mates so he made sure to match the Republican nominee s anti-immigration rhetoric.Raddatz asked Flynn if all undocumented immigrants should be rounded up and deported. Flynn not only replied by using what many consider to be a racial slur, by using it he suggested that Trump would round them all up and send them back across the border as he builds his massive and expensive wall along the U.S.-Mexican border. Let s talk about immigration,  Raddatz began.  Let me ask you immigration: should all undocumented immigrants be deported? So undocumented or illegal?  Flynn asked in some attempt for clarification. Undocumented, illegal  Raddatz replied.Then Flynn proceeded to lecture Raddatz. Are they here illegally? I mean, if they re here illegally, then it s illegal. I mean, again, back to my very first point, the rule of law in this country is probably the single biggest strategic advantage that we have, above and beyond all other countries in the world. And we cannot allow the rule of law to break down. Here s the video via YouTube. The anti-immigrant remarks begin at the 5:18 mark:While the act of crossing the border without permission is illegal, the people doing it are not. Actions are illegal, not people. But because they are inherently racist, conservatives prefer using this term to describe Hispanic people whom they do not want in America.That s why the correct term to use is  undocumented. Elsewhere in the interview, Flynn also accused Hillary Clinton of blaming all white people for the killing of innocent black people by police officersLt. General Michael Flynn served his country honorably during his many years of service, some of which were under President Obama, who appointed him as Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2012.He is also a registered Democrat, although he claims that today s Democratic Party isn t the same one he grew up with, which is weird considering Democrats are fighting for social justice, women s rights, and civil rights just as they have been doing since Flynn was a child in the 1960s, so it s a little bit of a head-scratcher as to why he would want to ruin his reputation by agreeing to be vetted as a potential running mate for a racist bigoted Republican candidate like Donald Trump.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"July 10, 2016",2603
 Kansas GOP Will Undercut State Supreme Court Before Fixing Education Budget As Ordered,"Kansas  education system is a mess, thanks to the Republican-led legislature s budget cuts. Funding allocation is heavily biased against poorer schools, and the state s Supreme Court ordered the legislature to fix it so it was both fair and in line with the state s constitution. So what are these Republicans doing instead? They re looking for ways to undermine the Supreme Court instead of doing their jobs.The Kansas Supreme Court said that all schools would remain closed across the state until the legislature fixed the funding problems. They re supposed to meet on June 23, ahead of the June 30 deadline set by the court, to work on the issue.However, in a move that s oh-so-typical of crooked Republicans, they re going to meet next week to discuss an amendment to the state constitution to limit the power of the court, instead of understanding that they screwed up and putting forth an honest effort to fix education funding.The House and Senate Judiciary Committees will put their heads together and plot this out next week. The plan? Find a way to stop the court from ever halting funding in the future. They re wrapping the issue in the pretty paper of  the people of Kansas should be deciding this, not the courts,  and tying it neatly with a satin bow of  we need to have discussions on this, not court orders. In other words, they re sounding the GOP s trumpet of alarm on what they think is a runaway court system because the courts aren t doing what they want.What they re not thinking about (and they re Republicans so why would they?) is all the innocent students, teachers and administrators caught up in this. Special education students, for instance, could see some necessary summer classes cancelled if the schools lose their funding, along with federal funding.The state is mandated to evaluate students with disabilities and create individual education programs that fit their needs, and, for some students, that includes summer school in order to ensure they continue to progress throughout the entire year.There are also teachers who are starting to look for jobs out of state because they ve had it with Republicans  inability to do anything for the people. One teacher said: They need to do what the kids do  sit down and solve a problem. That would be so nice if they did. But, in light of the GOP s political crusade against the courts, they d rather hamstring their state courts than actually solve the problem. Of course, they ve acknowledged that this amendment, if it went through, wouldn t affect the current crisis. However, it could ensure that the courts have a harder time addressing future funding problems that hurt innocent people.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"June 10, 2016",2715
IRRATIONAL GEORGETOWN PROFESSOR Has Month-Long Meltdown Over Fellow Muslim Professor Who Voted For Trump: “F*CK You!” [VIDEO],"A Georgetown University associate professor had a month-long meltdown after a Muslim woman explained why she voted for President-elect Donald Trump.Asra Q. Nomani, a former Georgetown journalism professor and Wall Street Journal reporter, wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post Nov. 10 explaining why she, as a Muslim woman and  long-time liberal,  voted for Trump.  I support the Democratic Party s position on abortion, same-sex marriage and climate change,  Nomani wrote.  But I am a single mother who can t afford health insurance under Obamacare. Here is a portion of Nomani s op-ed explaining why she s supporting Trump:A lot is being said now about the  silent secret Trump supporters. This is my confession   and explanation: I   a 51-year-old, a Muslim, an immigrant woman  of color    am one of those silent voters for Donald Trump. And I m not a  bigot,   racist,   chauvinist  or  white supremacist,  as Trump voters are being called, nor part of some  whitelash. In the winter of 2008, as a lifelong liberal and proud daughter of West Virginia, a state born on the correct side of history on slavery, I moved to historically conservative Virginia only because the state had helped elect Barack Obama as the first African American president of the United States.But, then, for much of this past year, I have kept my electoral preference secret: I was leaning toward Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.Tuesday evening, just minutes before the polls closed at Forestville Elementary School in mostly Democratic Fairfax County, I slipped between the cardboard partitions in the polling booth, a pen balanced carefully between my fingers, to mark my ballot for president, coloring in the circle beside the names of Trump and his running mate, Mike Pence.  WPJust prior to the election Nomani explains why she s voting for Trump:C. Christine Fair, a previously  friendly colleague,  went on a 31-day screed against Nomani spanning across Twitter and Facebook. According to Nomani s Dec. 23 follow-up complaint to the university, the  Peace and Security Studies  professor called her a  wretch,   clueless dolt  and a fame-monger.Fair also compared Trump to Adolf Hitler and asserted that Nomani s vote for Trump  helped normalize Nazis in DC.  She didn t clarify if she was referring to Trump supporters or actual Nazis marching the streets.She again attacked Nomani Dec. 6 with  an open letter  on Facebook, in which Fair told her to  f*ck off  and  GO TO HELL. It s unclear why Fair announces that she s  a slut. Nomani told The Daily Caller News Foundation that Georgetown professor Bruce Hoffman replied to her original Dec. 2 complaint on Dec. 3. He told her he forwarded her complaint to professor Irfan Nooruddin. Nooruddin is the faculty chair of Georgetown s School of Foreign Service.Nooruddin told Nomani in a Dec. 4 email that,  I shall follow up directly with Professor Fair.  Fair posted her Facebook rant about Nomani two days after Nooruddin said he would speak with her. Additionally, she threatened Nomani in an email Dec. 6 with  legal action.   Your attempt to silence my opinion or force a dialogue by involving my employer is unacceptable and any further action on your part to involve Georgetown will be met with legal action,  Fair wrote.  Your social media and email appeal to my employer with the intent or threat of damaging my employment status is a form of cyber bullying, which will not be tolerated.

GERMANY ELECTION BOMBSHELL: OPEN BORDERS Angela Merkel CLOBBERED At Polls…Party That Suggested Germany May Need To Start Shooting Migrants At Border WINS By Double Digits,"It appears that Obama ally, Angela Merkel is more popular with Muslim migrant males than the citizens of Germany .German voters turned to the far right in droves yesterday in a damning verdict on Angela Merkel s open door border policy. In regional elections she was humiliated by the anti-immigrant AfD   Alternative for Germany   party.Formed just three years ago, it has surged in popularity following Mrs Merkel s decision to roll out the red carpet for more than a million migrants.Analysts said the regional poll   in which Mrs Merkel s ruling Christian Democrats lost two out of three states   was a  worst case scenario  for the embattled chancellor ahead of a general election next year.The timing made it a virtual referendum on Germany s refugee policy. It will also be seen as an indictment of the failure of Europe s ruling classes to acknowledge the public s fears about migration.Mrs Merkel s welcome for arrivals from Syria, other parts of the Middle East and North Africa, has caused chaos across the continent.Initially, the incomers were greeted by crowds of well-wishers. But, faced with the sheer numbers, public opinion soured. And there was outrage when gangs of migrant men were involved in organised sex attacks on women in Cologne and other cities on new year s eve.One by one, EU states have thrown up border fences to stop the flow of arrivals   leading to the slow collapse of the Schengen passport-free zone. Via:DMWatch incredible video (below) that explains why German Chancellor Angela Merkel is getting hammered in the polls in Germany:German Chancellor Angela Merkel s party suffered a major setback in key state polls Sunday over her liberal refugee policy, while the right-wing populist AfD recorded a surge as it scooped up support from angry voters.Merkel s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) lost in two of three states in regional elections, and scored a historic low in its stronghold Baden-Wuerttemberg where it came in second place after the Greens, according to projections based on early results published by public broadcasters ARD and ZDF.The populist Alternative for Germany (AfD), which had sparked outrage by suggesting police may have to shoot at migrants to stop them entering the country, recorded double-digit support in the first elections they have stood for in all three regions.The elections are the biggest since Germany registered a record influx of refugees, and are largely regarded as a referendum on Merkel s decision to open the country s doors to people fleeing war.Bild daily called Sunday s polls  a day of horror for Chancellor Merkel  as the stunning popularity of the upstart AfD was a clear punishment for her policy. The people who voted for us voted against this refugee policy,  said AfD deputy chairman Alexander Gauland.Frauke Petry (L) and Ronald Glaeser of the right-wing populist party Alternative for Germany (AfD) party react after state elections exit poll results were announced on tv in Berlin on March 13, 2016Germans had watched in growing alarm as 1.1 million asylum seekers arrived in the country in 2015 alone.Despite facing intense pressure to change course, Merkel has resolutely refused to impose a cap on arrivals, insisting instead on common European action that includes distributing refugees among the EU s 28 member states.

 WATCH: Keith Olbermann SKEWERS Trump And GOP For Undermining Our Democracy,"In a video that everyone should see, GQ special correspondent Keith Olbermann had strong words for Donald Trump in response to his refusal to accept defeat if Hillary Clinton wins on Election Day.During the debate in Las Vegas last night, moderator Chris Wallace asked Trump point-blank if he will accept the results of the election. Trump replied by saying that he will have to look at it at the time and that  I will keep you in suspense. In other words, Trump is leaving open the possibility that he will reject the results on Election Day and refuse to concede defeat because he thinks he will be cheated of victory, which gives his rabid supporters the opening to follow through on their threats of bloody violence if the election doesn t go their way.Trump s insistence that the election is  rigged  and his refusal to say that he will accept the results and bow out with dignity like every other losing presidential candidate has done throughout American history is a threat to our democracy and the public safety.And Keith Olbermann was so outraged by Trump s debate answer that he exploded in righteous condemnation.Olbermann said Trump s remarks make him ineligible to run for president and told Trump to  burn in hell  for undermining our sacred democratic tradition of peaceful transfer of power. It was the first time in American history, through dozens of venomous painful campaigns and a series of impossibly close elections, the first and only time that a candidate of a major party had violated the fundamental precept of our democracy. It shakes every one of our freedoms, it mocks every dead American soldier, it spits in every sacrifice made under our flag. It has no comparison,  Olbermann continued, citing Al Gore, Andrew Jackson, and Samuel Tildon as examples of candidates who conceded defeats after close nasty elections. It foments revolution. It was and is the moral equivalent of treason. And this time it slipped passed no one. Not the moderator, not Fox News, not even Breitbart.com. No one. It was not a flash of anger from a man who gets angry once an hour. It was not another slab of red meat thrown to his crazed supporters. It was not another outrageous statement to throw up against the wall in this cheap reality game show version of a presidential campaign. He meant it! He means it! Olbermann made it clear that Trump is a danger to our values and Constitution and he only got angrier as he outed Trump as the unpatriotic sore loser that he is. Donald Trump is not invested in Democracy! Donald Trump is not invested in our Constitution! Donald Trump is not invested in America! Donald Trump is not invested in preventing people from being killed on the streets after an election like this were a Third World police state! Burn. In. Hell! In fact, Trump is so dangerous now that Olbermann called upon Republican leaders to to do everything within legal means to end Trump s candidacy because if they do not, they are responsible for whatever happens on Election Day and after. This is bigger than who is the next president of who is the next RNC chair or who is the next Speaker of the House,  Olbermann declared.  This is our democracy imperiled from within by a man you have permitted to speak for you. Compel him to withdraw! Now! Litigate against him, find enough doctors and have him declared psychiatrically incompetent. At minimum, cut off his funding completely and denounce him in the strongest possible terms because this nightmare, this fascist, this Trump is now your responsibility He must not be allowed the opportunity to keep us in suspense.

 FL Pastor Targets Neighbor With Nazi Flag Display Over Boating Laws (IMAGE),"Naples, Florida pastor John Gursoy is outraged over new boating regulations in the gated community where he lives. The new regulations include limiting the number of boats that can be parked at one dock and raising the age of boat operators from 13 to 14. Volunteer board members for the community association also voted to uphold a longstanding ban on two-stroke engines. The new regulations so infuriated the Florida pastor that he went to Kinkos and printed off a Nazi flag.Upon returning home, Gursoy raised the flag on a cherry picker in his yard. He also hung a sign slandering neighbor Peter Rietz, who volunteers his time to serve on the board.The sign reads  Peter Rietz Fascist? Discriminates. Image credit: Naples Daily NewsUpon seeing the display, some members of the Florida community were disturbed enough to call police.Because the flag and sign are on private property, local law enforcement officers say no crime is being committed.When asked about the display by Naples Daily News, Gursoy said: This flag is symbolic of the most discriminatory, selective enforcement of rules ever in the history of mankind. He went on to explain how the boating regulations, which were designed to protect the environment and members of the community where he lives, compare to Nazi Germany, saying it was all that  kept coming to my mind. Gursoy told Naples Daily News that he put the sign up as a warning to the community that this is the direction we re going with the current board. Because clearly not being able to park ten boats on a single dock or let a 13-year-old drive a watercraft is just like Nazi Germany all over again. It s very frustrating,  Peter Rietz said during an interview with Naples Daily News.  My wife is up in arms. Our neighbors are all up in arms. The police have been here. It s obviously in poor taste and reflects on the individual. He added, It s hard to believe how someone who holds himself out as a Christian would behave in this fashion.

 Paul Ryan Just Gave The Most CRINGEWORTHY Response To Trump’s Illegal Voters Lie (VIDEO),"President-elect Donald Trump has been a sore subject for Speaker of the House Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI). Not only did Ryan speak out against Trump multiple times during his presidential campaign (but stopped short of pulling his endorsement), but Ryan is getting exceedingly worse at defending the President-elect as time goes on.Last night, Ryan gave an extremely awkward, cringeworthy interview on CBS  60 Minutes. Every time Scott Pelley tried to grill Ryan on Trump, the Speaker of the House pretty much crumbled under the pressure.The most hilarious part of the interview was when Pelley asked Ryan about Trump s recent claim that  millions of people  voted illegally, therefore costing him the popular vote. Pelley asked: Trump tweeted in the last week or so that he had actually won the popular vote if you deduct the millions that voted illegally. Do you believe that? You can practically see Ryan s skin crawling. Ryan was noticeably uncomfortable with the question, and went into survival mode by playing dumb. REAL dumb. Blinking uncomfortably, Ryan said, I don t know, I m not really focused on these things. Pelley cornered Ryan and pressed him, Wait a minute, wait a minute. You have an opinion on whether millions of Americans voted illegally.  And Ryan got even dumber, right before our eyes. He said: I have no way of backing that up. I have no knowledge of such things. Ryan eventually gave up and without ever really answering the question, he said: It doesn t matter to me. He won the election.

The letter includes the usual pleasantries then asks Trump to keep the  international order  going. Hummm, that s a loaded demand because then-candidate Trump s stump mantra was to put America first. Um, yeah no May of 2010 is when Obama declared a  new international order was needed: President Obama is facing criticism for his declaration over the weekend that he would seek a new  international order,  with some questioning how much U.S. sovereignty the administration is willing to cede in exchange for more global cooperation. Trump campaigned on upsetting the apple cart for this new globalism and liberal political hack Fareed Zakaria wrote about the end to this  international order  in a Washington Post OpEd in which he bashed Trump s America first policy:In his first days in office, President Trump has begun to reverse the domestic policies of the previous eight years. But with regard to the United States  relations with the world, Trump seems far more radical. In word and deed, he appears to be walking away from the idea of America at the center of an open, rule-based international order. This would be a reversal of more than 70 years of U.S. foreign policy.CNN reports:During his final moments in the Oval Office, President Barack Obama folded into thirds a handwritten letter to Donald Trump, slid it into an envelope, and in neat capital letters addressed it to  Mr. President. Now, the contents of that letter   the last direct communication between the 44th and 45th presidents   have emerged for the first time after CNN obtained a copy.Full text of the letter:Dear Mr. President  Congratulations on a remarkable run. Millions have placed their hopes in you, and all of us, regardless of party, should hope for expanded prosperity and security during your tenure.This is a unique office, without a clear blueprint for success, so I don t know that any advice from me will be particularly helpful. Still, let me offer a few reflections from the past 8 years.First, we ve both been blessed, in different ways, with great good fortune. Not everyone is so lucky. It s up to us to do everything we can (to) build more ladders of success for every child and family that s willing to work hard.Second, American leadership in this world really is indispensable. It s up to us, through action and example, to sustain the international order that s expanded steadily since the end of the Cold War, and upon which our own wealth and safety depend.Third, we are just temporary occupants of this office. That makes us guardians of those democratic institutions and traditions   like rule of law, separation of powers, equal protection and civil liberties   that our forebears fought and bled for. Regardless of the push and pull of daily politics, it s up to us to leave those instruments of our democracy at least as strong as we found them.And finally, take time, in the rush of events and responsibilities, for friends and family. They ll get you through the inevitable rough patches. Michelle and I wish you and Melania the very best as you embark on this great adventure, and know that we stand ready to help in any ways which we can.Good luck and Godspeed,BOYou can read other letters from Bush to Obama and Clinton to Bush HERE",politics,"Sep 3, 2017",3335
 WATCH: This Hilarious Video Is The Only Way Palin’s Trump Endorsement Word Salad Makes Any Sense,"Sarah Palin s horrific word salad of an endorsement of Donald Trump on Tuesday evening didn t make sense in any language resembling English, but a viral Vine video puts Palin s praise in the only context where it works: In the mouth of Iggy Azalea.In the video from Lindsey Bieda entitled  Iggy s freestyle has gotten quite a bit weaker,  the words from Azalea s rap breakdown have been replaced by audio of Palin from the Trump announcement.Instead of the Australia-born Azalea s  Fancy,  we hear Palin s eardrum piercing rhyme:  Right wingin , bitter clingin , proud clingers of our guns, our god, and our religions. In case you feel like the creator of the Vine took poor Palin out of context, this is the entire paragraph from that section of the speech, which would probably make the most epic rap video in history if it received the same treatment:Well, and then, funny, ha ha, not funny, but now, what they re doing is wailing,  well, Trump and his, uh, uh, uh, Trumpeters, they re not conservative enough.  Oh my goodness gracious. What the heck would the establishment know about conservatism? Tell me, is this conservative?

How  bout the rest of us? Right wingin , bitter clingin , proud clingers of our guns, our god, and our religions, and our Constitution. Tell us that we re not red enough?

WHOA! MAXINE WATERS Has Brain Freeze Mid-Interview: “What-What…” [Video],"Maxine Waters has a major brain freeze during an interview ripping on the Trump administration Karma?  Recognize that evidence is pouring in and it s growing or what is matt  what what is wrong with them, I just don t quite understand,  If Maxine Waters is the best the Dems have in their arsenal then this is good news for Republicans. The California Democrat has been bashing President Trump at every turn with no real reason. She s even called for his impeachment. Is this all she s got? She never speaks about what she s doing for the district in California that she doesn t even live in. She refuses to hear any opposing views during town halls. She has opposing voices removed so the adoring masses can rant and rave about Trump. It s truly a Banana Republic in Maxine s world. We ve reported in the past about her bizarre behavior but the best question was asked by Tucker Carlson:Maxine Waters is so filled with hate for anyone who disagrees with her, that she s decided to appoint herself as the Democrat s chief attack dog for President Trump and his administration. Unfortunately for Maxine, making a public spectacle of herself also comes with a price. Speaking of a price how about the price tag on career politician Maxine Waters $4.3 million mansion?Tucker Carlson reacted to Rep. Maxine Waters  (D-Calif.) threat to  take [HUD Secretary Dr. Ben Carson s] a** apart  by noting she might indeed be qualified to take his job.Carlson said Waters, a 40-year politician, lives in a 6,000 square-foot mansion worth $4.3 million that is not in her congressional district.He asked how Waters could afford a home like that in a ritzy neighborhood while solely working as a representative of the 43rd District. We should take her seriously on this subject,  Carlson said, calling her a  confirmed expert on the question on housing. He said that while Waters sometimes speaks using racially-charged rhetoric, she lives in a neighborhood that is only six percent African-American.Via: Fox News",politics,"Jul 16, 2017",1996
" Trump TRASHES Sean Spicer’s Cell Phone Checks, Signals Trump Team Implosion (VIDEO)","The Trump team is caving in on itself, and Donald Trump s latest comments certainly won t help.Earlier today, Trump appeared on Fox & Friends where he blatantly criticized White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer. Addressing the mysterious and numerous leaks that have been coming out of the White House, Spicer was reported to be checking the professional and personal cell phones of White House staffers in the West Wing to make sure they weren t involved in leaking any information. It was a drastic move, and we ve never seen such distrust within an administration, and yet Trump still claims everything in the White House is running like a  well-oiled machine.  But something tells us that after Spicer hears what Trump just said, things are going to change.In his exclusive White House interview, Trump admitted that he wouldn t have handled the leaks the way Spicer did. Steve Doocey asked Trump: Sean Spicer asked his communication team,  Alright come on in everybody. Put your phone right over there. We have a leaker here. We re gonna have the White House lawyer look at your phones.  How intent are you on finding who the leaker or leakers are in your administration? Not just your communications team, but over at the State Department, maybe the intel community, everywhere? Trump first bragged about how great his press secretary was (even though there have been several reports that state Trump is unhappy with Spicer s performance and would rather replace him with a woman). He said, Well first of all, Sean Spicer is a fine human being. He s a fine person. Then Trump criticized Spicer: I would have done it differently. I would have gone one-on-one with different people. I would have handled it different than Sean, but Sean handles it his way, and I m OK with it. Hinting that he felt Spicer was going far too easy on staffers, Trump joked that if it were up to him,  there are things you can do that are a hell of a lot worse.

 WATCH: Bill O’Reilly Calls Black Lives Matter A National Hate Group (VIDEO),"Bill O Reilly attacked the Black Lives Matter movement Friday night, saying that the BLM protestors are a part of a  hate America group. O Reilly made his comments at the conclusion of a segment where he covered the shooting in Dallas, Texas that resulted in the deaths of five police officers. O Reilly mentions that less than two percent of arrests that occur in the United States involve the use force in an attempt to make a case that most police officers are not bad people.O Reilly then goes on to admit that there is a problem with the amount of force that is being leveraged by minorities. However, there are too many incidents where minority Americans are being killed or hurt over low-level beefs. That s the truth. So, law enforcement leadership must compel their own agencies to act with restraint.  O Reilly said.O Reilly then goes on to say that he doesn t believe that police officers are specifically targeting black people and the  stats back him up.  That s a very misleading statement. There is statistical evidence that shows that police officer s racial biases might not have a major impact on whether they actually kill a black person while on patrol. That being said, there is overwhelming statistical evidence that racial biases in policing in general and our criminal justice system are probably culpable for the disparity in the number of black Americans killed by police.Simply put, it doesn t matter if police officers are personally racist or not, the systems that they serve are.O Reilly concludes the segment by stating that the Black Lives Matter  inflames rather than illuminates.  Therefore, they are a hate group.That s a rather ironic conclusion to come to, considering the fact that the mainstream media   especially conservative media outlets like Fox News, would not be discussing the topic of institutionalized racism and police brutality if it were not for the bravery of thousands of people standing up and insisting that black lives do in fact matter.You can watch the segment below:Featured image from video screenshot",News,"July 9, 2016",2062
"BOOM! LEADERS Of 34,000 Black Churches Tell Members To Turn Backs On Race-Baiter-For-Hire Al Sharpton’s D.C. March Against Trump","Skip Al Sharpton s March on Washington on Saturday, the president of the National Black Church Initiative told members of the network s 34,000 churches Friday afternoon.NBCI s statement, released a day before Sharpton s march, slammed the Rev. for squandering his  carte blanche access  to the Obama White House, claiming that he  blew an opportunity to secure critical issues that affect the African American community.  Instead of pursuing meaningful changes,  Al Sharpton and his liberal friends took the time to get rich,  the news release says.On Saturday morning, NBCI s president, Rev. Anthony Evans, explained his opposition to Sharpton s march in an interview with Heat Street. They re asking our churches to march when they ve had all the power for the past eight years? We re not doing that. That s poppycock.   We re holding Sharpton accountable. We re not participating in Sharpton s speech. We have created our own agenda,  Evans said.In the past, NBCI has said that the Democratic Party has not met the needs of its black constituents, slamming both Sharpton and the National Black Caucus. It has also been highly critical Donald Trump, whom NBCI has called  the biggest racist since Bull Connor. Sources interviewed by Heat Street varied in their assessment of NBCI s political influence. Evans said the group s 34,000 affiliate churches together have 15.7 million members, spanning 15 denominations.NBCI s takedown of Sharpton comes as he has struggled to draw a crowd to his March on Washington on Saturday.A source at Sharpton s march estimated that 2,000, at most, were there as of noon, adding that the drizzly, chilly weather may be suppressing turnout. Another source put that number below 1,000. CPSAN is live-streaming the event, and its footage shows a sparse-looking crowd.Speaking at the March, Sharpton tried to ward off criticism about the low turnout.  They re going to lie tomorrow and say wasn t but 200 of us, but look at this crowd in the rain,  Sharpton said at around 12:17 p.m., addressing attendees.For entire story: Heat Street",politics,"Jan 15, 2017",2067

WATCH: Colin Kaepernick’s Worst Nightmare [Video],"You might remember this bright moment from when Obama was president A couple of years ago, 500 high school choir students sang the Star-Spangled Banner in the 18-story atrium of a Hyatt hotel in Louisville as part of the Kentucky Music Educators Convention. Any anti-anthem liberals in the building probably ran out screaming into the night:Good thing Louisville doesn t have an NFL team. If there had been a visiting team in the building, some of the players would have had to put their helmets on to keep their skulls from exploding.REMEMBER WHEN OBAMA SUPPORTED KAEPERNICK S ANTI-ANTHEM PROTEST? OBAMA DEFENDS KAEPERNICK S Decision to Disrespect American Flag:  He s generated more interest in something that needs to be talked about When Obama had the opportunity to speak out against 49er s quarterback Colin Kaepernick s disrespect for our flag, he chose instead to defend his actions, explaining that it was okay for him to sit out the national anthem, as long as he was bringing attention to the cop-hating/killing, divisive Black Lives Matter terror group President Obama said San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick is  exercising his constitutional right  to sit out the national anthem, but the president acknowledged that the silent protest is a  tough thing  for military service members to accept.At a news conference in China on Monday, the president said he did not doubt Kaepernick s sincerity in his decision not to stand for the anthem ahead of games to protest the treatment of African Americans by law enforcement in U.S. cities. Obama noted a  long history  of sports figures protesting political or social issues. There are a lot of ways you can do it,  Obama said after the G-20 summit here.  As a general matter when it comes to the flag and the national anthem and the meaning that holds for our men and women in uniform and those who fought for us   that is a tough thing for them to get past to then hear what his deeper concerns are. But I don t doubt his sincerity. I think he cares about some real, legitimate issues that have to be talked about. If nothing else, he s generated more conversation about issues that have to be talked about. Obama said he has not closely followed the controversy surrounding Kaepernick s actions while he has been overseas, but he said he was aware of the public response, which has been sharply divided. The president has sought to balance his own response to the unrest and mistrust between African Americans and police officers over the past several years, including in Baton Rouge and Dallas this year. You ve heard me talk in the past about the need for us to have an active citizenry,  Obama said.  Sometimes that s messy and controversial and gets people angry and frustrated. But I d rather have young people that are engaged in the argument and trying to think through how they can be part of our democratic process than people just sitting on the sidelines not participating at all. My suspicion is that over time he s going to refine how he thinks about it. Maybe some of his critics will start seeing that he had a point about concerns about justice and equality. That s how we move forward.    Washington Post ",politics,"Nov 18, 2017",3196
OH BOY! TARGET CUSTOMERS RESPOND TO THE NEW GENDER NEUTRAL TOY LABELING,"Oh boy! Target customers are hot under the collar on this pc move to give toys gender neutrality. Angry customers are ditching Target and have been very vocal about their displeasure on social media: @thehill so now being PC is more important than helping customers. No more Target shopping for me Target is bringing Americans one step closer to a gender-neutral society. The department store chain announced what it called  something exciting  Friday. After some customers complained about certain toys  being designated as appropriate for girls, it is doing away with signs denoting gender classifications. Over the past year, guests have raised important questions about a handful of signs in our stores that offer product suggestions based on gender,  according to Target s online publication,  A Bullseye View. Toys no longer will be labeled according to sex and displayed on either pink or blue shelving. Gender-neutral signage also will appear in the children s bedding section. The only place gender labels will remain is in the children s clothing department.The gender-labeling brouhaha began last June when Target customer and Ohio mother Abi Bechtel snapped a photo of Target signage indicating  Building Sets  and  Girls  Building Sets  and tweeted it to the chain along with a stern message. It stood out to me as a good example of the way our culture tends to view boys and men as the default, normal option, and girls and women as the specialized option,  Bechtel told CNN.Maybe that particular sign was a bit ridiculous, but it certainly didn t require eliminating all gender classifications to correct it.Oddly, Target said that  we use signs and displays specially designed to help guests get through the store efficiently,  and  signs that sort by brand, age or gender help them get ideas and find things faster. So, the answer is to remove signs that help customers  get through the store efficiently ?Read more: BIZ PAC REVIEW",left-news,"Aug 13, 2015",1948
NANCY PELOSI Thanks Dreamers for Coming to U.S. Illegally: ‘They’re so lovely’ [Video],"This is what Democrats think of people who broke our laws to come to America?

Pelosi made the remark during a town hall with CNN s Chris Cuomo where she took a question from  Dreamer  Adrian Reyna. Our Dreamers, they make America dream again,  Pelosi said.  They re so lovely and we, frankly, owe a debt to your parents for bringing you here to be such a brilliant part of our future.

Former president Barack Obama s administration provided cover to Dreamers from possible deportation to their countries of origin with the DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) executive order in 2012.The Trump administration rescinded the order last month and called on Congress to replace it within six months. Reyna expressed concern about Democrats coming to a deal with President Donald Trump about illegal immigration and Dreamers.Pelosi promised Reyna that a clean  Dream Act  would be passed before December.Pelosi continued to heap praise on Dreamers and their families and laid out Democrats  plan to block the Trump administration and Republicans from taking any kind of potential action against illegal immigration.Read more: WFB ",left-news,"Oct 5, 2017",1659
" Hillary Breaks Silence On GOP Health Care Bill, Brilliantly Shuts It Down (TWEETS)","The Senate Republicans unveiled their disastrous health care bill on Thursday, and it was immediately shot down by everyone from Republicans to Democrats to former President Barack Obama. Now, former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has broken her silence to weigh in on the bill   and the GOP is going to HATE it.On Friday, Clinton urged her supporters to  speak out  against the Obamacare replacement plan, encouraging them to choose  people over politics.  As the Republicans  health care plan will strip tens of millions of Americans of their life-saving health coverage, her message is surely an important one.Clinton took to Twitter to take her message public. In solidarity with the words of former President Barack Obama, Clinton slammed the GOP bill: @BarackObama is right. This is a critical moment about choosing people over politics. Speak out against this bill. The Senate Republicans have been creating this bill in absolute secrecy, and it s no wonder why. This health care bill is a monstrosity and an assault on the lives of most Americans. Thanks to the GOP s proposal, cuts would be made to Medicaid and federal funding for Planned Parenthood would be prohibited, which has made even conservatives voice their concerns.Yesterday, Obama called the Senate s pathetic attempt at replacing his health care bill a massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in America.  He also said it was  not a health care bill  at all. Clinton called the GOP out even more viciously by following up her first tweet with this: Forget death panels. If Republicans pass this bill, they re the death party. We could not have said that any better. The GOP s health care bill proves that they don t give a sh*t about the lives of Americans, and this measure must be stopped in its tracks.Featured image via Bryan Thomas / Getty Images",News,"June 23, 2017",1886
“Dear Mr. Trump”…NBC Uses Kids To Make STUNNING Anti-Trump Propaganda VIDEO…PREPARE TO BE SHOCKED!,"NBC News handpicked anti-Trump tykes for two propaganda videos to make it appear that every child in American thinks Pres.

I m afraid that you re gonna hurt some of us blacks. You are here, attempting to white-wash America. I don t like your definition of American, because I don t seem to fit within it. These adolescent activists really, really don t want a border wall or travel ban on state-sponsors of terror, because it s not  nice  and  fair : Not letting immigrants into America is really not nice, so please let them in. It s not fair for refugees. Just because I m Mexican, doesn t mean you can build a wall around the country. Please don t build a wall, and don t let people have guns. P.S.   Please don t build a wall around Mexico. P.P.S.   Please, please don t stop the refugees from coming. You re going to separate me away from the rest of my family, and I really don t what that because I love them too much. Some of my friends are really scared about you building a wall, and the travel ban, because a lot of their families live in different places. WATCH: And, then, there s this rebuke from a young lady who appears in both videos: When you speak on things that make me feel uncomfortable or I disagree with, you make me feel small, because I know I can t change it.

" Yes, Hillary Was Wrong About Reagan, But Her Owning It Tells Us So Much More (VIDEO)","First off, if you re reading this and have never been wrong, look in the mirror and repeat,  I m full of myself.  Truth is, we all make mistakes. Some bigger than others, but owning up to those mistakes shows a bigger strength of character. To be blunt, admitting you re wrong is far better than insisting you re right.So, when Hillary Clinton appeared on MSNBC and praised former President Reagan alongside Nancy Reagan for their help in starting a  national conversation  about HIV and AIDS, you can only imagine people angrily took to their social media accounts to call her out. Hell, as a gay woman, I did too. Hillary Clinton: The Reagans, particularly Nancy, helped start  a national conversation  about HIV and AIDS. https://t.co/7sZp8X53fb  MSNBC (@MSNBC) March 11, 2016 As most of us know, Reagan wasn t just awful regarding HIV and AIDS, he was outright horrific, with his White House even calling AIDS the  gay plague.  Clearly, Hillary was incorrect in her assessment of the Reagans regarding AIDS. There s no doubt about that.And about an hour later, Hillary acknowledged that she was wrong, noting how utterly incorrect she was in her original statement. She wrote: While the Reagans were strong advocates for stem cell research and finding a cure for Alzheimer s disease, I misspoke about their record on HIV and AIDS. For that, I m sorry. Hillary Clinton s statement on her comments about the Reagans' record on HIV and AIDS: pic.twitter.com/RtIs0zpJfk  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) March 11, 2016For many, this apology hasn t been enough and have been using this mistake as a tool to attack her. However, let s think about that. Here s a woman who, quite honestly, cannot afford to make a mistake in speaking pretty much at any time, and she s completely owning her mistake. She doesn t double down on it, like many politicians, even recently, have done. She doesn t say it was a  gotcha question  that forced her to say the wrong thing. She owned it. And owning a mistake, no matter the size, is actually a quality you want in a leader, to be frank. You don t want someone who can t recognize their blunders. You don t want someone who s going to hold their ego above what is right. You want someone who is accountable for their actions. Which is exactly what Hillary just did   she owned her mistake, and on top of it, apologized. When was the last time you heard a politician apologize for something that they did wrong?She fucked up & owned it. I guess. It's the ones who will NEVER apologize (Trump, Dubya) that are dangerous. https://t.co/abPt6CfAbU  Patton Oswalt (@pattonoswalt) March 11, 2016Here s the thing.

 Hillary Has BIG Lead Over Trump In Latest National Poll,"It appears Clinton s  post convention bump  has not ended quite yet. In a new national poll released from Quinnipiac, Hillary Clinton is trouncing Donald Trump by 10 points, which has been consistent with her post-convention spike in the polls.Not only is Clinton beating Trump by 10 points in this stage of the game, she has nabbed 51 percent of the vote, a milestone not reached in polling until now. With now a majority of the country supporting Clinton, Trump will have to work hard to overcome his self-inflicted controversies and multiple  shakeups  that have hardline conservatives anxious.The poll shows Clinton winning with the support of the Obama coalition:The Democratic nominee drew wide levels of support from women (60 percent to 36 percent), those between the ages of 18-34 (64 percent to 29 percent), and 35-49 (53 percent to 39 percent). Trump, meanwhile, holds a smaller advantage among men (48 percent to 42 percent) and a large lead over Clinton among whites who do not have a college degree (58 percent to 35 percent).Independent voters prefer Clinton slightly, 46 percent to 41 percent, while likely voters between the ages of 50-64 are split, with 46 percent behind Clinton and 47 percent backing Trump. Voters 65 and older supported Trump 49 percent to 45 percent.Clinton also holds a lead of 62 points among non-white voters, 77 percent to Trumps 15 percent. Looks like his African American outreach and immigration flip-flopping is going swimmingly.The poll, which was conducted on Aug. 18-24, surveying 1,498 likely voters, and with a margin of error of 2.5 percent, shows that nine of ten voters surveyed said they have made up their mind about who they were going to vote for.Even when factoring in third party candidates Gary Johnson and Jill Stein, Clinton still beats Trump by 5 points.The time for Trump to appeal to undecided, independent voters is quickly coming to a close, as early voting begins mid September.Clinton s RealClearPolitics average has her up by 5 points, and Nate Silver s FiveThirtyEight gives her an 84 percent chance of winning the election, so the poll conducted by Quinnipiac is not an outlier.Featured image via Jeff Swensen/Getty Images",News,"August 25, 2016",2196
"TJ MAXX AND MARSHALLS Tell Employees To Trash Signs For Ivanka Trump Line, Mix Line With General Merchandise"," According to the New York Times, outlet stores T.J. Maxx and Marshalls have instructed their employees to throw away signs for Ivanka Trump s clothing line, and hang her clothes so that they mix in with other lines.The instruction was to eliminate special displays for the merchandise,  not to remove it from the sales floor,  said Doreen Thompson, a spokeswoman for the TJX Companies, the retailers  parent corporation. We offer a rapidly changing selection of merchandise for our customers, and brands are featured based on a number of factors,  she said.The company did not respond to the New York Times query as to whether or not this kind of handling of product was normal, but one employee came forward and told the paper that after several years of being employed with the stores, she had not been instructed to do this before. -The BlazeTJ Maxx and Marshalls corporate headquarters are located in the very liberal city of Farmington, MA.In the 2016 general election, 75 percent of the 39,722 registered voters in Farmington participated in the presidential election.Of those voters, 20,277 voted for Clinton, with 7,031 for Trump. So it should come as no surprise that the people making the decisions on behalf of the stores would send such an outrageous message to their employees that appears to be intended to harm Ivanka Trump s clothing line. For many shoppers like myself, these new developments as they relate to the trashing of Ivanka Trump s clothing and accessory brand really puts a crimp in my shopping patterns at some of my favorite stores, which include Norstrom and TJ Maxx and the TJ Maxx owned Home Goods store. Gone are the days when these kinds of corporate decisions are made and kept under the radar. Trump has an army of exceptionally loyal supporters who are willing to defend him and his lovely family, even if it means we have to do our shopping elsewhere.In a USA Today article, TJ Maxx CEO Ernie Herrman noted,  We are extremely pleased that our comp store sales growth was almost entirely driven by customer traffic.  Your companies recent decision to trash Ivanka Trump s brand in your store may change that Mr. Herrman Here s a letter to TJMaxx CEO from a leftist in VT that was published in the local Mountain Times newspaper. Editors note: the following is an open letter to Ernie Herrman, CEO and president of TJMaxxDear Mr. Herrman,I am writing to tell you that I have stopped shopping in TJMaxx stores since the election in November of 2016. That is when I became aware that you carry Ivanka accessories. I m sure that you have not missed my 100 or so dollars a month that I would usually spend at your store. But I have missed shopping with you. This is probably hurting me more than it is you. But the real hurt is what is being delivered to our nation by Trump.Let me be very clear: The objective of boycotting is not to destroy your business or to cause job losses. The objective is to send a direct message to you, the CEO, to your Board of Directors, and your stockholders that your merchandising choice regarding Ivanka brand goods needs to change.I know that public pressure and consumer spending has a big effect on markets and policy. Just this week, the CEO of Uber resigned from Trump s Economic Advisory Council. Uber profited from continuing service at JFK airport last weekend when all the NYC cabs boycotted the airport in a show of support for the protesters. Consequently, 200,000 customers deleted their Uber accounts. The CEO decided it wasn t economically advantageous to be aligned with the Trump administration.Recently, the retailers: Shoes.com, Neiman Marcus, and Nordstrom s all cancelled their Ivanka fashion and jewellery line because of public outcry and customer boycotts of their stores.In a consumer based economy, our money has power. So I am asking you to cancel your merchandising of Ivanka accessories. Please let me know as soon as possible when you have done this, so that I can resume shopping at my favorite TJMaxx store.In the meantime, I am going to donate the $100.00 I would have spent at your establishment this month to the ACLU, so that green card holders, immigrants and refugees seeking to enter the US can have some legal representation.Sincerely and respectfully, Your Once Loyal Customer,Candy Jones, Rutland ",politics,"Feb 9, 2017",4306
MICHELLE OBAMA Rants About Mississippi’s ‘Religious Freedom’ Bill During Commencement Speech,"Our racist First lady made an impact on the graduates of Jackson State by turning her commencement speech into a political rant way to go Michelle! Everything is about the  shtruggle  with this radical ideologue. She s probably the worst person to pick for anything uplifting because in her eyes it s all about being a victim. Can t wait to see her leave the White House!In a rare entrance into a politically charged controversy, first lady Michelle Obama used a commencement speech Saturday at Jackson State University in Mississipppi to directly target the state s recently-passed  religious freedom  bill. We see it right here in Mississippi   just two weeks ago -  how swiftly progress can hurtle backward,  Obama said.  How easy it is to single out a small group and marginalize them because of who they are or who they love. Obama made the comment following an impassioned revival of the state and university s stained history with regard to civil rights. So we ve got to stand side by side with all our neighbors  - straight, gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender; Muslim, Jew, Christian, Hindu immigrant, Native American   because the march for civil rights isn t just about African Americans, it s about all Americans,  she said.  It s about making things more just, more equal, more free for all our kids and grandkids. That s the story you all have the opportunity to write. That s what this historic university has prepared you to do.  The state has received growing criticism from human rights organizations and businesses over the controversial law, saying it restricts the rights of the LGBT community. In a press conference Friday in the United Kingdom, President Obama was asked about a recent travel advisory to British LGBT citizens cautioning them of the newly passed law, he said it  should be overturned. In her speech, the first lady also reflected on the heated political battles her husband has endured as president, and urged students not to fall into disarray over the  anger and vitriol  in the political environment. We pay endless attention to folks who are blocking action, blocking judges, blocking immigration, blocking a raise in the minimum wage. Just blocking,  Obama said.  We are consumed with the anger and vitriol that are bubbling up, with folks shouting at each other, using hateful and divisive language. Obama then revisited some of the vitriol directed towards her husband over his eight years as president, including the  birther  conspiracy theory widely promoted by GOP frontrunner Donald Trump just five years ago. And then there s the countless times when that language gets personal and is directed at my husband  - charges that he doesn t love our country,  Obama said.  The time he was called a liar in front of a joint session of Congress. The nonstop questions about his birth certificate and his belief in God. Via: ABC",politics,"Apr 24, 2016",2873

OBAMA’S CHIEF OF STAFF WARNS AMERICA…He’s Not Going Away Quietly: Promises “Audacious Executive Actions” Including Gun Control,"The big question is who, in Congress has the will to stop him? Keep your notepads handy America, and start keeping track of who you will and won t re-elect in 2016.White House chief of staff Denis McDonough pushed back against the notion his president is played out in the wake of his last State of the Union address, promising  audacious executive action  in Barack Obama s final year in office.During a breakfast with reporters in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, McDonough responded to the observation that the president s final speech before Congress lacked the usual pledge to  go it alone  if lawmakers failed to act.Coupled with the feeble executive actions on gun control announced earlier this month, had President Obama rethought the utility of acting unilaterally on issues important to the White House?  We ll do audacious executive action over the course of the rest of the year, I m confident of that,  said McDonough, explaining that President Obama s decision not to outline specific executive actions was more about a commitment to process than a lack of willpower. Process is your friend, but process also dictates what you can do,  McDonough said.  And we do want to make sure that the executive actions we undertake are not left hanging out there, subject to Congress undoing them. In addition to gun control, the White House has expressed interest in further unilateral actions on immigration reform, and in working around Congress to close the prison in Guantanamo Bay. But McDonough said the White House is considering executive action on any and all issues, and that the main question President Obama plans to ask himself is  Why not?   And so that s the spirit through which we ll approach this last year,  McDonough said.Via: National Review",politics,"Feb 5, 2016",1764
James Comey’s Legacy: Blaming Russia Rather Than Saudi Arabia And Israel,"21st Century Wire says If it wasn t enough with James Comey doubling down on the Russia-gate narrative, the so called  liberal mainstream media  are continuing his work since he got fired by President Donald J. Trump by saying that what happened is a   gift to Russia .The United States of America, an atrophying empire, is a laughing stock with these kind of affairs rather than a power to be taken seriously alongside other nations.More on this report from The Duran  (Image   NBC)Adam Garrie The DuranThe last time Donald Trump fired an important official prior to an important foreign visit was when Steve Bannon was fired from his position on the  National Security Council the day before a Chinese delegation led by President Xi was to meet with Trump. It was also incidentally a day prior to Trump s infamous 6 April 2017 attack on Syria.Steve Bannon was known to favour Russian reconciliation, particularly over Syria cooperation. He was also a leader of the anti-Chinese camp, especially in the aftermath of Mike Flynn s resignation. The dots were not difficult to connect.READ MORE: Steve Bannon demoted Chinese President coming to Florida. Coincidence?Now, within hours of Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov holding talks with US Secretary of State Tillerson and apparently Donald Trump in Washington, FBI Director James Comey has been fired.Donald Trump is quoted in an official statement as saying, The FBI is one of our Nation s most cherished and respected institutions and today will mark a new beginning for our crown jewel of law enforcement .The liberal mainstream media are all ready saying that this is a  gift of Russia  as if Trump will hand over Comey s firing notice to Mr. Lavrov on a silver plate, not that Russia particularly cares. Russia does not.Theories about Trump firing Comey to placate Russia are not only literally stupid, but it makes a mockery of the United States. Then again, so too did the entire  Russiagate  investigation that Comey s FBI was leading.In a democracy, important checks and balances held keep each branch of government scrutinised when any powers are abused or laws are  broken. It is important to have an impartial FBI willing to investigate any branch of government when anything untoward is suspected. But it s a two way street.The un-elected FBI can go rogue as much as a President or Senator and that is what the FBI has done over investigating the non-issue of Donald Trump s non-existent connections with Russia.Any patriotic American should be ashamed of what Comey has done, continuing to investigate such a totally bogus set of entirely political/opportunistic accusations.Not only is there zero evidence of any Trump-Russia connnections but more importantly, America is too powerful to be influenced by ANY foreign power. So too are Russia and China.The fact that America still can be influenced by foreign powers is not due to capitulation, but instead due to greed which leads to a voluntary surrender of US interests whilst those of a foreign state are elevated.But is Russia one of those states? No it is not.There are no signs historically nor presently that Russia has ever had any positive influence on the United States Federal government at any level.The same cannot be said of Saudi Arabia and Israel,  states which are far weaker than Russia, but states which never the less have influenced US policy making for decades.America doesn t depend on Saudi or Israel for survival, but in a corrupt country, money talks and this is what America has become: a corrupt country that is so rich and so powerful it doesn t even need to be corrupt, but greed has got the better of integrity.For years America depended on cheap oil from Saudi Arabia and its other OPEC goons and likewise, many Americans liked to lavish themselves in the easy money which flowed from the repressive desert kingdom. Hillary Clinton was a prime example of a politician bought and sold in Saudi gold.Likewise, the US based Israel lobby is extraordinarily powerful in terms of monetary influence. Groups like the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) donate millions to political causes. By contrast, groups which oppose Israel s foreign and internal policies do not have that kind of money and therefore do not have that kind of influence.One can love or hate Saudi Arabia/love or hate Israel, but these are facts and they are as American as baseball and burgers. They have nothing to do with Wahhabism or Zionism per se.What a shameful state it is, that US politicians feel the need to rely on foreign money for personal enrichment. I can understand why leaders in the poor countries that America dominates feel the need to go along with American money and influence in order to enrich themselves or even keep their nation from total collapse or invasion, but what is America s excuse? America has the biggest military in the world and is the world s wealthiest nation   Continue this report at The DuranREAD MORE COMEY NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire COMEY FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"May 10, 2017",5083
 Bernie Was Asked To Say One Nice Thing About Trump And Cruz – His Response Is Hilarious (IMAGE/VIDEO),"Bernie Sanders made his first appearance on television after his  YUGGGEEE  win in the New Hampshire primaries with the hosts of The View  and it was the perfect mixture of seriousness as well as a little light-humored fun. Bernie began his discussion talking about  the greed and recklessness of Wall Street,  but when he was asked to say just one nice thing about Donald Trump or Ted Cruz, he couldn t!Considering his Republican rivals have never said a single nice thing about Bernie Sanders other than he s a  socialist,  his response was fitting. Here was his first reaction when asked to say something nice about Trump: What can I say? When pressed further,  come on Bernie, he has nice ties; nice hair?  he said very sarcastically  humble  earning him a huge applause. Donald Trump is anything but humble, but we have a feeling everyone already knew that. The guy puts his name on everything for crying out loud.And   when he was asked about Ted Cruz, the only thing he could say was  loud.  Come on Bernie, there must be something nice you can say about the Senator from Texas!He did have nice things to say about John Kasich, though, calling him an  old friend,  and he does think Hillary Clinton is  intelligent.  Very classy with those responses.After winning New Hampshire, Bernie is starting to get more attention from Donald Trump. He used to ignore him preferring to attack Hillary, but now things have changed. While Bernie appeared on The View, Trump was busy taking shots at the Senator from Vermont. On CBS This Morning Trump ignored the polls (go figure, right?) and suggested he would take Bernie head on in a matchup. Real Clear Politics shows Bernie beating Trump handily, though; not the other way around. I would beat Bernie easily. The one thing we have in common is trade. The difference between us is, [Sanders] can t do anything about it. I can. Pic via Real Clear PoliticsFeatured image from screen capture.",News,"February 10, 2016",1937
" Trump Abuses Power, Punishes Qatar For Refusing To Give $500 Million Loan To Son-In-Law Kushner","It turns out that Donald Trump was abusing his power when he accused Qatar of supporting terrorism and allowed sanctions against them.Jared Kushner did not gain his position by getting confirmed by the Senate. He got his cushy White House job because he is married to Trump s daughter Ivanka.And he has been using his position in an effort to do business, and is using Trump s power as president to retaliate against those who refuse to do business with him.Just before Trump went on a tirade against Qatar, Kushner tried to get a loan from one of the richest men in the small country, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani.Kushner asked for a $500 million loan from al-Thani because he needs to come up with $1.3 billion in the next two years before the interest-only mortgage is due on his family s 666 Fifth Avenue building in Manhattan. The only stipulation to getting the loan was that Kushner had to come up with some co-funding for the project. Of course, Kushner failed to live up to his end of the deal, so al-Thani wisely walked away rather than risk that much money on someone who makes promises he can t keep.And because al-Thani rejected Kushner s request, Donald Trump retaliated against Qatar by accusing the Gulf nation of being too close to Iran and gave Saudi Arabia the green light to cut diplomatic ties with Qatar and block transports there. Saudi Arabia is home to some Trump businesses, and Trump has been sucking up to the Saudi government, so of course, Saudi Arabia would gladly help Trump punish Qatar for refusing to give his family money.During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar   look!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 6, 2017Trump would repeat his claims against Qatar at the White House Rose Garden.It turns out that Russian hackers were responsible for making up statements by Qatari officials to make it look like they support Iran. But Trump refuses to stop punishing Qatar just because they refused to give money to Jared Kushner.This is what abuse of power looks like. Trump and Kushner are using the White House to punish nations who refuse to do business with them. That is grounds for impeachment right there. This is exactly why Trump should have been forced to cut all ties with his businesses, and why anyone who works in the White House should do the same to avoid these kinds of conflicts of interest.Clearly, Trump and his family are using the presidency as a way to enrich themselves.Featured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"July 14, 2017",2570
 Guy Who Forgot 9/11 Happened Says Hillary Is ‘Too Stupid’ To Be President Because She Stayed With Bill,"Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani decided to weigh in on future President Hillary Clinton s ability to perform as President in a worse way than Trump s  stamina  remarks at the first presidential debate. According to Giuliani, the fact that Clinton is strong enough and loves her husband enough to make things work after he was unfaithful to her is actually a sign of weakness that disqualifies her from being President just as much as That One Time She Coughed and her almost superhuman ability to work hard and power through pneumonia for days before she finally collapses from the unnatural amount of strain she put on her body. The president of the United States, her husband, disgraced this country with what he did in the Oval Office and she didn t just stand by him, she attacked Monica Lewinsky,  Giuliani said following Monday s debate.  And after being married to Bill Clinton for 20 years, if you didn t know the moment Monica Lewinsky said that Bill Clinton violated her that she was telling the truth, then you re too stupid to be president. Bill Clinton didn t actually  violate  anybody. He fooled around with a woman, who was an adult and consented to everything they did, behind his wife s back. While she certainly had the right to be angry, and Americans absolutely have the right to criticize him (he was wrong, but it didn t affect his ability to run the country), to say that she is a weak person for staying with him is absolute bullsh*t. Clinton s strength is in her ability to forgive, to think of the bigger picture, to make her marriage work in spite of a very, very public affair.Of course, this is the sort of thinking that can be expected from a guy who was Mayor when the planes hit the twin towers on September 11, 2001, yet recently completely forgot about those attacks while he was criticizing President Obama, who paraded his mistress around for all to see, and who told the media he was divorcing his wife before he informed her or their children. Under those eight years, before Obama came along, we didn t have any successful radical Islamic terrorist attack inside the United States,  Giuliani said in a speech in youngstown, Ohio earlier last month. They all started when Clinton and Obama got into office. Watch it below:https://twitter.com/asvokos/status/780619672760623104/video/1Featured image via screengrab",News,"September 27, 2016",2360
 Top GOP Adviser Admits Hillary Clinton Would Be A ‘Better President’ Than Donald Trump (VIDEO),"Mitt Romney s top adviser in the 2012 election has just accepted what any reasonable Republican that cares about the future of America will have to come to terms with: Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton would be a better president than the current GOP front runner, Donald Trump.Stuart Stevens reluctantly admitted this on Tuesday during Bloomberg s With All Due Respect. The star strategist said: Personally, I think Hillary Clinton would be a better president than Donald Trump because I think that Donald Trump is a dangerous person and is someone who would embarrass America. Stevens added that this didn t necessarily mean that he supported Clinton, but that the prospect of backing Trump was something he couldn t possibly stomach. I have no desire to see Hillary Clinton as president of the United States. But if this is the choice   I will not give her my vote, but I can t support Donald Trump. We can t blame Stevens for not wanting to be part of the reason that America imploded. You can watch Stevens  interview below: Stevens has been bashing Trump for months, previously stating: I don t think he s going to be on the ballot by Feb. 1. The greatest sin in his value system is to be a loser, and most people who run for president lose. I don t think he ll risk it. Of course, Trump took to Twitter and gave it right back to him in his usual childlike manner:TwitterNo one thought Trump would make it this far, but he has and the more level-headed Republicans are scrambling to do whatever damage control they can. As Trump continues to look like a more likely candidate for the GOP nomination, Stevens is hardly the only Republican who is refusing to back Trump if he wins. On Tuesday, Rep. Scott Rigell (R-Va.) emailed supporters and said that he would not be standing behind someone so lacking in the judgement, temperament and character needed to be our nation s commander-in-chief. Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) even said he would back a third-party candidate instead of Trump. It s unsure how the GOP will ever be taken seriously now that Trump has obliterated any remaining respect the party had. Featured image via Flickr and screenshots",News,"March 2, 2016",2153
VOTING MACHINES STOLEN In Controversial GA Election Where Dems Hope To Embarrass Trump With 30-Yr Old Jon Ossoff Win,"SANDY SPRINGS, Ga., April 18 (Reuters)   For U.S. President Donald Trump, an off-year congressional election on Tuesday in the reliably Republican northern suburbs of Atlanta could spell trouble if Democratic upstart Jon Ossoff pulls off a surprise victory.Watch MSNBC Morning Joe show hosts and guest attempt to contain their excitement over the possibility of a Democrat winning the seat of former House Leader Newt Gingrich and now, in a special election they are hoping to replace Tom Price s Georgia s 6th District seat:Donald Trump is actively campaigning against Ossoff on social media:Republicans must get out today and VOTE in Georgia 6.

But an Ossoff win could weaken Trump s already shaky hold on his fellow Republicans in the House by encouraging those in competitive districts to distance themselves from the president.The Democrats are in the fight of their lives. They re pulling out all of the stops, as they believe a win in this traditionally  red  district of Georgia would be a huge black eye for President Trump. Is anyone really surprised that voter machines from this district have been stolen only days before what Democrats are calling a  must win  election?Channel 2 Action News has learned that critical voting machines were stolen just days before polls will open for a special election.State officials are investigating after equipment was taken from a Cobb County precinct manager s vehicle. According to Secretary of State Brian Kemp, the equipment was stolen on Saturday evening while the vehicle was parked at the Kroger on Canton Road.Kemp s office says Cobb County Elections waited two days to tell his office about the theft of the machines.The four so-called ExpressPoll machines were the computers poll workers used to check-in voters, and check those off who cast ballots. It s very shocking, especially with the climate we have of voter fraud out there,  one Georgia voter told Channel 2 s Ross Cavitt.Cobb County Elections Director Janine Eveler said the stolen machines cannot be used to fraudulently vote in Tuesday s election.

" Canadian PM Justin Trudeau Explains Why He Keeps Saying, “I’m A Feminist”","During a United Nations Summit in New York City today focusing on women, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau explained why he is going to keep saying he is a feminist. I m going to keep saying loudly and clearly that I am a feminist, until it is met with a shrug,  said Trudeau.  Why does every time I say I m a feminist, the twitterverse explodes and news medias pick it up. It shouldn t be something that creates a reaction. It simply is saying, I believe in the equality of men and women and I believe that we still have an awful lot of work to do to get there.  Trudeau added,  It s just really, really obvious that we should be standing up for women s rights and trying to create more equal societies. Like, duh. Trudeau won election in October 2015 after a stunning comeback from third in the polls. He famously appointed an equal number of men and women in his cabinet, and cited his reasoning for doing so,  because it s 2015.  During the summit, he called on World leaders to follow Canada s lead when appointing their own cabinets. Any world leaders who tell me  I d love to, I just can t do that with the current configuration of our parliament or of my party , I say:  Well, what are you doing to change that configuration and draw out those extraordinary women who can be leaders that we need? ,  he told the crowd.His party, the Liberal Party, also recouped a majority in the Canadian Parliament. His election also inspired an increase of voter turnout by 7.4 percent to 68.5 percent. Trudeau won election on a campaign platform of progressive reforms, such as increasing taxes on the wealthy and dramatically improving infrastructure. Trudeau has also given warm welcomes to Syrian refugees arriving in Canada to seek asylum.Just last week, Trudeau met with President Barack Obama to promote ties between Canada and the United States, and to announce joint efforts to combat climate change.

Washington State Judge Issues Temporarily Block on Trump’s Immigration Ban Nationwide,"21st Century Wire says On Friday a US federal judge in Seattle ordered a temporary nationwide block on U.S. President Donald Trump s 7 nation immigration ban. As expected, the White House labeled the legal ruling outrageous  and promised the White House intends to file an emergency stay .Judge James Robart, appointed by former President George W. Bush in 2003, ruled on the President s executive order on immigration and US Customs and Border Protection has already alerted major airlines that the United States will start reinstating previously banned visas.The war of words between the Administration and the members of the judiciary has been stark.  The answer is none,  Judge Robart said.  You re here arguing we have to protect from these individuals from these countries, and there s no support for that.  The new lawsuit seeks to permanently block parts of Trump s recent executive order which suspend entry to US from 7  Muslim-majority  countries which include Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Libya and Somalia.The complaint states that,  The executive order effectively mandates that the states engage in discrimination based on national origin and/or religion, thereby rescinding the states  historic protection of civil rights and religious freedom,  , calling it a violation of the U.S. Constitution.The US Department of Justice is expected to file the emergency stay on Saturday in defiance of Friday s ruling.Washington state s Attorney General, Bob Ferguson, issued a stark challenge to President Trump, saying, This decision shuts down the executive order right now. No one is above the law   not even the President . It s our president s duty to honor this ruling and I ll make sure he does,  added Ferguson.It is estimated that some 60,000 people from the affected countries had their visas cancelled.READ MORE TRUMP NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Trump Files",US_News,"February 4, 2017",1877

However, members of the club, who are overwhelmingly Jewish, are split on whether to welcome the soon-to-be private citizen Obama.According to the New York Post, members at the club are angry with President Obama for failing to veto a UN vote which criticized Israel. Worse still for some members, Obama s secretary of state John Kerry then delivered a speech which was highly critical of the Israeli government. In light of the votes at the UN and the Kerry speech and everything else, there s this major uproar with having him part of the club, and a significant portion of the club has opposed offering him membership.

" Scaramucci’s New Yorker Interview Is More Than Just Gross, It May Be A Felony","Donald Trump s pick for Communications Director took an already vulgar administration down another notch or 3,000 in an interview with the New Yorker. It sounded more like the ramblings of a low-level mob hitman than of a Harvard Law grad who s been tapped to manage the message of the supposed leader of the free world. Here are a few snippets (not suitable for most children, or for most adults):On Chief of Staff Reince Priebus: Reince Priebus   if you want to leak something   he ll be asked to resign very shortly. And Reince is a fucking paranoid schizophrenic, a paranoiac Let me leak the fucking thing and see if I can cock-block these people the way I cock-blocked Scaramucci for six months.' On leakers: What I want to do is I want to fucking kill all the leakers and I want to get the President s agenda on track so we can succeed for the American people. On Steve (whatever his job is) Bannon: I m not Steve Bannon, I m not trying to suck my own cock. The interview, which would have made Richard Nixon blush, was potentially more than just obscene. It may have been a felony. In talking about leaks (he wants to  kill  all the leakers), one quote got the attention of the FBI: This is going to get cleaned up very shortly, O.K.?  Scaramucci said.  Because I nailed these guys. I ve got digital fingerprints on everything they ve done through the F.B.I. and the fucking Department of Justice. Source: Daily BeastThere s just one problem. Scaramucci doesn t actually work for the White House yet. He has no security clearance. He isn t supposed to have any digital fingerprints or any information from the FBI or the  fucking Department of Justice.  If he does have that information, he s potentially in a lot of trouble. If an FBI agent turned over digital evidence demonstrating who did particular leaks, that would be wildly inappropriate,  said Ken White, a former federal prosecutor who now practices criminal defense and first amendment litigation.  It could be illegal. It could be a felony depending on the nature of the evidence and how it was acquired. It would certainly be a flagrant breach of FBI protocol. Of course, Scaramucci is a Trumpster, which means that as with any Trump marriage, he and truth likely sleep in separate bedrooms.

As FOX Business reported Friday, Priebus s position in the White House is once again in jeopardy as National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn and Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney are a few of the candidates under consideration to replace him if the president decides to go that route, according to sources close to the situation.On Friday, the White House did not deny the possibility that Priebus could be replaced.While the administration may believe it s typical for some officials to stay and others to head home, according to experts outside the White House, it s unusual for a chief of staff to head home early on such an important trip.

JUST IN: Mystery Surrounds Obama Appointee Judge Who Recused Herself From Fusion GPS Case Also Handling DNC Corruption in Awan Brothers Case,"A federal judge in Washington, D.C. has recused herself from a second case involving Trump dossier firm Fusion GPS.Tanya S. Chutkan, an Obama appointee, recused herself on Monday from a case involving a dispute over subpoenas issued for Fusion GPS, the firm that commissioned the dossier.This Obama appointee is like so many others controversial. Change.org has a petition calling for her impeachmentA SUPPORTER COMMENT OF THE PETITION:  There is Clear and Present Danger, in our Government and to our Country. Judge Chutkin needs to do her duty, as Sworn by Oath, to let in ALL of the evidence pertaining to Imran Awan and Hina Alvi. As it stands today, 9/12/2017, Judge Chutkin is not doing her duty to protect the interests and lives of the Citizens of The United States. For this reason, I am standing with others, shoulder to shoulder, and calling for the Removal and Impeachment of Federal District Judge Tanya S. Chutkin. Aleksej Gubarev, a Russian tech executive accused in the dossier of hacking Democrats  computer systems, has sought to subpoena Fusion GPS records and to depose its employees to find out more about the research firm s work on the dossier.Gubarev is suing BuzzFeed for defamation for publishing the dossier earlier this year. He denies the allegations laid out in the document, which was written by former British spy Christopher Steele.Chutkan recused herself last month from another case involving Fusion GPS. The firm had filed suit against its bank, TD Bank, to keep it from complying with a subpoena issued by the House Intelligence Committee, which sought Fusion s bank records.Chutkan presided over that case from Oct. 20 to Nov. 9. It was reassigned to Judge Richard Leon, a George W. Bush appointee. Since taking over the case, Leon has indicated that he plans to allow more transparency into the court proceedings involving the battle over Fusion s bank records. He has ordered several documents be unsealed and made public.Chutkan has presided over the case involving the lawsuit against BuzzFeed since Aug. 31. Her replacement is Trevor McFadden, a Trump appointee who assumed office in October.The reasons for Chutkan s recusals remain a mystery Chutkan refused to comment on the recusal but her work with a medical technology firm also represented by Fusion GPS could be the reason.In any case, this is yet another case of the Obama hand in just about everything that has to do with corruption and intel agencies.Read more: Daily Caller",Government News,"Dec 16, 2017",2478

FOX NEWS BIGGIE Promoting Mass Immigration To The U.S. Via FOX News,"Has anyone else out there noticed the total bias with promotion of certain candidates running for president? I ve noticed who they re supporting like never before. I should say I ve noticed who they detest also Trump No matter which candidate you support, this isn t fair to the American people who really want the truth in the media to come back. FOX is now no better than the liberal leaning CNN and MSNBC. Watch with caution after you read this excellent piece about the connections between big business, politics and the push for mass immigration to America. Yes folks, it s all about cheap labor and money Mr. Rupert s most visible investment is Fox s princess Megyn Kelly, who just coincidentally signed a book deal with another of Ruperts  business interests, Harper Collins books.Murdoch is a long time supporter of Senator Marco Rubio. The Fox News head even structured media coverage on behalf of Rubio during the Gang-of-Eight legislative fiasco in 2013.Mr. Murdoch, who is also leading the executive decision-making on Fox programming, also contracts pollster Frank Luntz to appear on Fox News broadcasting during the 2016 election cycle.[ ] since June, Murdoch has been attending Ailes s daily executive meeting held on the second floor of Fox headquarters. The secretive afternoon gathering in Ailes s conference room is attended by about a half-dozen of the network s most senior lieutenants. It s where some of the most sensitive decisions about running the channel are discussed. (link)Frank Luntz has sub-contracts with Marco Rubio and a long-term relationship with Rubio going back to the Freshman Senator s time in the Florida Legislature. Rubio alone has paid Luntz $350,000+Frank Luntz focus groups regularly find Marco Rubio as the winner of debate and opinion programming.The executive in charge of Fox News debate programming, debate questioning and debate structure is Bill Sammon. (circled below)The Washington Post has an outline describing how Bill Sammon runs the entire show at Fox regarding debates; and how he is the person who Chris Stirewalt, Megyn Kelly, Chris Wallace and Brett Baier directly report to for all debate issues, construction, and question organization.In essence, Bill Sammon runs the show.Bill Sammon s daughter is Brooke Sammon who is the press secretary for Marco Rubio s presidential campaign.A generally interested observer would consider this a conflict of interest worthy of full disclosure. However, none of the above have ever been publicly disclosed prior to the media presentation by any Fox entity.During the Fox Business News debate several political junkies noted a rather curious omission: Senator Marco Rubio was never questioned about the 2013 Senate Gang-of-Eight bill and his stance on Comprehensive Immigration Reform. In fact, if you were to review the debate substance you d note that candidate Rubio wasn t directly questioned about his immigration positions at all.Read more: Conservative Treehouse ",Government News,"Feb 6, 2016",2974
 Trump Tried Recreating Obama’s Iconic ‘Bin Laden Raid’ Situation Room Photo – And It’s So Pathetic,"For months now people close to Trump have been privately saying the president is consumed by a seething jealousy of his predecessor, Barack Obama. Where Trump s approval ratings continue to circle the drain, Obama s have seen a post-presidency surge. Adding to that, Obama s signature piece of legislation is not only more popular than ever, but the replacement Trump came up with imploded before it even got a vote. In the media and from political observers Obama is viewed as smarter, more mature, and more gifted politically than Trump. And Trump knows it.So what is Trump to do? Imitate.Hours after he ordered a missile strike in Syria, Trump s press secretary Sean Spicer tweeted an image of the situation room.WH photo (ed for security): @potus receives briefing on #syria military strike fr Nat Security team, inc @vp , SECDEF, CJCS via secure VTC pic.twitter.com/aaCnR7xomR  Sean Spicer (@PressSec) April 7, 2017It bore a disturbing resemblance to one of the most famous photographs of Obama s time in office, the night he ordered the mission to kill Osama Bin Laden.However, unlike Obama s image   filled with serious people doing serious jobs   Trump s version contains a number of unqualified goons. The photograph of Obama and his staff signaled strength. Trump s imitation serves only to show the world what a clown show Trump s White House is.Trump s attack on Syria may have earned praise by right-wingers, but it s already escalating tensions in the region and may someday be viewed as the opening shot in a devastating global war. Russia, rather than cave to Trump s show of  strength  has vowed to arm the Syrian regime with more anti-aircraft weapons meant to shoot down any U.S. plane that crosses the border.BREAKING Russian military says it will help Syria strengthen its air defenses after US strike.  The Associated Press (@AP) April 7, 2017The attack also alienated Iran, pushing them further into the sphere of Russia and the Assad government.Those are some serious consequences for actions being made by Rex Tillerson, a former oil executive with ties to Russia; Steve Bannon, the owner of white nationalist website Breitbart; and Jared Kushner, the son of a real estate mogul who married the daughter of a real estate mogul. The fact that those men are even in the room is a disgrace to America s military, who will likely carry the brunt of the consequences.But perhaps the biggest joke in the room is that Donald Trump himself.

‘One for the Ages’ Full Video and Transcript of Trump’s Incredible UN Speech [Video],"A speech for the ages was given today by President Donald Trump. He addressed the 72nd meeting of the United Nations General Assembly in New York for the first time in his presidency. The transcript is below.PRESIDENT TRUMP: Mr. Secretary General, Mr. President, world leaders, and distinguished delegates: Welcome to New York. It is a profound honor to stand here in my home city, as a representative of the American people, to address the people of the world.As millions of our citizens continue to suffer the effects of the devastating hurricanes that have struck our country, I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room who has offered assistance and aid. The American people are strong and resilient, and they will emerge from these hardships more determined than ever before.Fortunately, the United States has done very well since Election Day last November 8th. The stock market is at an all-time high   a record. Unemployment is at its lowest level in 16 years, and because of our regulatory and other reforms, we have more people working in the United States today than ever before. Companies are moving back, creating job growth the likes of which our country has not seen in a very long time. And it has just been announced that we will be spending almost $700 billion on our military and defense.Our military will soon be the strongest it has ever been. For more than 70 years, in times of war and peace, the leaders of nations, movements, and religions have stood before this assembly. Like them, I intend to address some of the very serious threats before us today but also the enormous potential waiting to be unleashed.We live in a time of extraordinary opportunity. Breakthroughs in science, technology, and medicine are curing illnesses and solving problems that prior generations thought impossible to solve.But each day also brings news of growing dangers that threaten everything we cherish and value. Terrorists and extremists have gathered strength and spread to every region of the planet. Rogue regimes represented in this body not only support terrorists but threaten other nations and their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanity.Authority and authoritarian powers seek to collapse the values, the systems, and alliances that prevented conflict and tilted the world toward freedom since World War II.International criminal networks traffic drugs, weapons, people; force dislocation and mass migration; threaten our borders; and new forms of aggression exploit technology to menace our citizens.To put it simply, we meet at a time of both of immense promise and great peril. It is entirely up to us whether we lift the world to new heights, or let it fall into a valley of disrepair.We have it in our power, should we so choose, to lift millions from poverty, to help our citizens realize their dreams, and to ensure that new generations of children are raised free from violence, hatred, and fear.This institution was founded in the aftermath of two world wars to help shape this better future. It was based on the vision that diverse nations could cooperate to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security, and promote their prosperity.It was in the same period, exactly 70 years ago, that the United States developed the Marshall Plan to help restore Europe. Those three beautiful pillars   they re pillars of peace, sovereignty, security, and prosperity.The Marshall Plan was built on the noble idea that the whole world is safer when nations are strong, independent, and free. As President Truman said in his message to Congress at that time,  Our support of European recovery is in full accord with our support of the United Nations. The success of the United Nations depends upon the independent strength of its members. To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of the future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past. Our success depends on a coalition of strong and independent nations that embrace their sovereignty to promote security, prosperity, and peace for themselves and for the world.We do not expect diverse countries to share the same cultures, traditions, or even systems of government. But we do expect all nations to uphold these two core sovereign duties: to respect the interests of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation. This is the beautiful vision of this institution, and this is foundation for cooperation and success.Strong, sovereign nations let diverse countries with different values, different cultures, and different dreams not just coexist, but work side by side on the basis of mutual respect.Strong, sovereign nations let their people take ownership of the future and control their own destiny. And strong, sovereign nations allow individuals to flourish in the fullness of the life intended by God.In America, we do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to watch. This week gives our country a special reason to take pride in that example. We are celebrating the 230th anniversary of our beloved Constitution   the oldest constitution still in use in the world today.This timeless document has been the foundation of peace, prosperity, and freedom for the Americans and for countless millions around the globe whose own countries have found inspiration in its respect for human nature, human dignity, and the rule of law.The greatest in the United States Constitution is its first three beautiful words. They are:  We the people. Generations of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of those words, the promise of our country, and of our great history. In America, the people govern, the people rule, and the people are sovereign. I was elected not to take power, but to give power to the American people, where it belongs.In foreign affairs, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty. Our government s first duty is to its people, to our citizens   to serve their needs, to ensure their safety, to preserve their rights, and to defend their values.As President of the United States, I will always put America first, just like you, as the leaders of your countries will always, and should always, put your countries first. (Applause.)All responsible leaders have an obligation to serve their own citizens, and the nation-state remains the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.But making a better life for our people also requires us to work together in close harmony and unity to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people.The United States will forever be a great friend to the world, and especially to its allies. But we can no longer be taken advantage of, or enter into a one-sided deal where the United States gets nothing in return. As long as I hold this office, I will defend America s interests above all else.But in fulfilling our obligations to our own nations, we also realize that it s in everyone s interest to seek a future where all nations can be sovereign, prosperous, and secure.America does more than speak for the values expressed in the United Nations Charter. Our citizens have paid the ultimate price to defend our freedom and the freedom of many nations represented in this great hall. America s devotion is measured on the battlefields where our young men and women have fought and sacrificed alongside of our allies, from the beaches of Europe to the deserts of the Middle East to the jungles of Asia.It is an eternal credit to the American character that even after we and our allies emerged victorious from the bloodiest war in history, we did not seek territorial expansion, or attempt to oppose and impose our way of life on others. Instead, we helped build institutions such as this one to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all.For the diverse nations of the world, this is our hope. We want harmony and friendship, not conflict and strife. We are guided by outcomes, not ideology. We have a policy of principled realism, rooted in shared goals, interests, and values.That realism forces us to confront a question facing every leader and nation in this room. It is a question we cannot escape or avoid. We will slide down the path of complacency, numb to the challenges, threats, and even wars that we face. Or do we have enough strength and pride to confront those dangers today, so that our citizens can enjoy peace and prosperity tomorrow?If we desire to lift up our citizens, if we aspire to the approval of history, then we must fulfill our sovereign duties to the people we faithfully represent. We must protect our nations, their interests, and their futures. We must reject threats to sovereignty, from the Ukraine to the South China Sea. We must uphold respect for law, respect for borders, and respect for culture, and the peaceful engagement these allow. And just as the founders of this body intended, we must work together and confront together those who threaten us with chaos, turmoil, and terror.The scourge of our planet today is a small group of rogue regimes that violate every principle on which the United Nations is based. They respect neither their own citizens nor the sovereign rights of their countries.If the righteous many do not confront the wicked few, then evil will triumph. When decent people and nations become bystanders to history, the forces of destruction only gather power and strength.No one has shown more contempt for other nations and for the wellbeing of their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea. It is responsible for the starvation deaths of millions of North Koreans, and for the imprisonment, torture, killing, and oppression of countless more.We were all witness to the regime s deadly abuse when an innocent American college student, Otto Warmbier, was returned to America only to die a few days later. We saw it in the assassination of the dictator s brother using banned nerve agents in an international airport. We know it kidnapped a sweet 13-year-old Japanese girl from a beach in her own country to enslave her as a language tutor for North Korea s spies.If this is not twisted enough, now North Korea s reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles threatens the entire world with unthinkable loss of human life.It is an outrage that some nations would not only trade with such a regime, but would arm, supply, and financially support a country that imperils the world with nuclear conflict. No nation on earth has an interest in seeing this band of criminals arm itself with nuclear weapons and missiles.The United States has great strength and patience, but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea. Rocket Man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime. The United States is ready, willing and able, but hopefully this will not be necessary. That s what the United Nations is all about; that s what the United Nations is for. Let s see how they do.It is time for North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future. The United Nations Security Council recently held two unanimous 15-0 votes adopting hard-hitting resolutions against North Korea, and I want to thank China and Russia for joining the vote to impose sanctions, along with all of the other members of the Security Council. Thank you to all involved.But we must do much more. It is time for all nations to work together to isolate the Kim regime until it ceases its hostile behavior.We face this decision not only in North Korea. It is far past time for the nations of the world to confront another reckless regime   one that speaks openly of mass murder, vowing death to America, destruction to Israel, and ruin for many leaders and nations in this room.The Iranian government masks a corrupt dictatorship behind the false guise of a democracy. It has turned a wealthy country with a rich history and culture into an economically depleted rogue state whose chief exports are violence, bloodshed, and chaos. The longest-suffering victims of Iran s leaders are, in fact, its own people.Rather than use its resources to improve Iranian lives, its oil profits go to fund Hezbollah and other terrorists that kill innocent Muslims and attack their peaceful Arab and Israeli neighbors. This wealth, which rightly belongs to Iran s people, also goes to shore up Bashar al-Assad s dictatorship, fuel Yemen s civil war, and undermine peace throughout the entire Middle East.We cannot let a murderous regime continue these destabilizing activities while building dangerous missiles, and we cannot abide by an agreement if it provides cover for the eventual construction of a nuclear program. (Applause.) The Iran Deal was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into. Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States, and I don t think you ve heard the last of it   believe me.It is time for the entire world to join us in demanding that Iran s government end its pursuit of death and destruction. It is time for the regime to free all Americans and citizens of other nations that they have unjustly detained. And above all, Iran s government must stop supporting terrorists, begin serving its own people, and respect the sovereign rights of its neighbors.The entire world understands that the good people of Iran want change, and, other than the vast military power of the United States, that Iran s people are what their leaders fear the most. This is what causes the regime to restrict Internet access, tear down satellite dishes, shoot unarmed student protestors, and imprison political reformers.Oppressive regimes cannot endure forever, and the day will come when the Iranian people will face a choice. Will they continue down the path of poverty, bloodshed, and terror? Or will the Iranian people return to the nation s proud roots as a center of civilization, culture, and wealth where their people can be happy and prosperous once again?The Iranian regime s support for terror is in stark contrast to the recent commitments of many of its neighbors to fight terrorism and halt its financing.In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations. We agreed that all responsible nations must work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them.We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow it to tear up our nation, and indeed to tear up the entire world.We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology. We must drive them out of our nations. It is time to expose and hold responsible those countries who support and finance terror groups like al Qaeda, Hezbollah, the Taliban and others that slaughter innocent people.The United States and our allies are working together throughout the Middle East to crush the loser terrorists and stop the reemergence of safe havens they use to launch attacks on all of our people.Last month, I announced a new strategy for victory in the fight against this evil in Afghanistan. From now on, our security interests will dictate the length and scope of military operations, not arbitrary benchmarks and timetables set up by politicians.I have also totally changed the rules of engagement in our fight against the Taliban and other terrorist groups. In Syria and Iraq, we have made big gains toward lasting defeat of ISIS. In fact, our country has achieved more against ISIS in the last eight months than it has in many, many years combined.We seek the de-escalation of the Syrian conflict, and a political solution that honors the will of the Syrian people. The actions of the criminal regime of Bashar al-Assad, including the use of chemical weapons against his own citizens   even innocent children   shock the conscience of every decent person. No society can be safe if banned chemical weapons are allowed to spread. That is why the United States carried out a missile strike on the airbase that launched the attack.We appreciate the efforts of United Nations agencies that are providing vital humanitarian assistance in areas liberated from ISIS, and we especially thank Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon for their role in hosting refugees from the Syrian conflict.The United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions of dollars in helping to support this effort. We seek an approach to refugee resettlement that is designed to help these horribly treated people, and which enables their eventual return to their home countries, to be part of the rebuilding process.For the cost of resettling one refugee in the United States, we can assist more than 10 in their home region. Out of the goodness of our hearts, we offer financial assistance to hosting countries in the region, and we support recent agreements of the G20 nations that will seek to host refugees as close to their home countries as possible. This is the safe, responsible, and humanitarian approach.For decades, the United States has dealt with migration challenges here in the Western Hemisphere. We have learned that, over the long term, uncontrolled migration is deeply unfair to both the sending and the receiving countries.For the sending countries, it reduces domestic pressure to pursue needed political and economic reform, and drains them of the human capital necessary to motivate and implement those reforms.For the receiving countries, the substantial costs of uncontrolled migration are borne overwhelmingly by low-income citizens whose concerns are often ignored by both media and government.I want to salute the work of the United Nations in seeking to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes. The United Nations and African Union led peacekeeping missions to have invaluable contributions in stabilizing conflicts in Africa. The United States continues to lead the world in humanitarian assistance, including famine prevention and relief in South Sudan, Somalia, and northern Nigeria and Yemen.We have invested in better health and opportunity all over the world through programs like PEPFAR, which funds AIDS relief; the President s Malaria Initiative; the Global Health Security Agenda; the Global Fund to End Modern Slavery; and the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative, part of our commitment to empowering women all across the globe.We also thank   (applause)   we also thank the Secretary General for recognizing that the United Nations must reform if it is to be an effective partner in confronting threats to sovereignty, security, and prosperity. Too often the focus of this organization has not been on results, but on bureaucracy and process.In some cases, states that seek to subvert this institution s noble aims have hijacked the very systems that are supposed to advance them. For example, it is a massive source of embarrassment to the United Nations that some governments with egregious human rights records sit on the U.N. Human Rights Council.The United States is one out of 193 countries in the United Nations, and yet we pay 22 percent of the entire budget and more. In fact, we pay far more than anybody realizes. The United States bears an unfair cost burden, but, to be fair, if it could actually accomplish all of its stated goals, especially the goal of peace, this investment would easily be well worth it.Major portions of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to hell. But the powerful people in this room, under the guidance and auspices of the United Nations, can solve many of these vicious and complex problems.The American people hope that one day soon the United Nations can be a much more accountable and effective advocate for human dignity and freedom around the world. In the meantime, we believe that no nation should have to bear a disproportionate share of the burden, militarily or financially. Nations of the world must take a greater role in promoting secure and prosperous societies in their own regions.That is why in the Western Hemisphere, the United States has stood against the corrupt and destabilizing regime in Cuba and embraced the enduring dream of the Cuban people to live in freedom. My administration recently announced that we will not lift sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms.We have also imposed tough, calibrated sanctions on the socialist Maduro regime in Venezuela, which has brought a once thriving nation to the brink of total collapse.The socialist dictatorship of Nicolas Maduro has inflicted terrible pain and suffering on the good people of that country. This corrupt regime destroyed a prosperous nation by imposing a failed ideology that has produced poverty and misery everywhere it has been tried. To make matters worse, Maduro has defied his own people, stealing power from their elected representatives to preserve his disastrous rule.The Venezuelan people are starving and their country is collapsing. Their democratic institutions are being destroyed. This situation is completely unacceptable and we cannot stand by and watch.As a responsible neighbor and friend, we and all others have a goal. That goal is to help them regain their freedom, recover their country, and restore their democracy. I would like to thank leaders in this room for condemning the regime and providing vital support to the Venezuelan people.The United States has taken important steps to hold the regime accountable. We are prepared to take further action if the government of Venezuela persists on its path to impose authoritarian rule on the Venezuelan people.We are fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy trade relationships with many of the Latin American countries gathered here today. Our economic bond forms a critical foundation for advancing peace and prosperity for all of our people and all of our neighbors.I ask every country represented here today to be prepared to do more to address this very real crisis. We call for the full restoration of democracy and political freedoms in Venezuela. (Applause.)The problem in Venezuela is not that socialism has been poorly implemented, but that socialism has been faithfully implemented. (Applause.) From the Soviet Union to Cuba to Venezuela, wherever true socialism or communism has been adopted, it has delivered anguish and devastation and failure. Those who preach the tenets of these discredited ideologies only contribute to the continued suffering of the people who live under these cruel systems.America stands with every person living under a brutal regime. Our respect for sovereignty is also a call for action. All people deserve a government that cares for their safety, their interests, and their wellbeing, including their prosperity.In America, we seek stronger ties of business and trade with all nations of good will, but this trade must be fair and it must be reciprocal.For too long, the American people were told that mammoth multinational trade deals, unaccountable international tribunals, and powerful global bureaucracies were the best way to promote their success. But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs vanished and thousands of factories disappeared. Others gamed the system and broke the rules. And our great middle class, once the bedrock of American prosperity, was forgotten and left behind, but they are forgotten no more and they will never be forgotten again.While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing our commitment to the first duty of every government: the duty of our citizens. This bond is the source of America s strength and that of every responsible nation represented here today.If this organization is to have any hope of successfully confronting the challenges before us, it will depend, as President Truman said some 70 years ago, on the  independent strength of its members.  If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and overcome the present dangers together, there can be no substitute for strong, sovereign, and independent nations   nations that are rooted in their histories and invested in their destinies; nations that seek allies to befriend, not enemies to conquer; and most important of all, nations that are home to patriots, to men and women who are willing to sacrifice for their countries, their fellow citizens, and for all that is best in the human spirit.In remembering the great victory that led to this body s founding, we must never forget that those heroes who fought against evil also fought for the nations that they loved.Patriotism led the Poles to die to save Poland, the French to fight for a free France, and the Brits to stand strong for Britain.Today, if we do not invest ourselves, our hearts, and our minds in our nations, if we will not build strong families, safe communities, and healthy societies for ourselves, no one can do it for us.We cannot wait for someone else, for faraway countries or far-off bureaucrats   we can t do it. We must solve our problems, to build our prosperity, to secure our futures, or we will be vulnerable to decay, domination, and defeat.The true question for the United Nations today, for people all over the world who hope for better lives for themselves and their children, is a basic one: Are we still patriots? Do we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty and to take ownership of their futures? Do we revere them enough to defend their interests, preserve their cultures, and ensure a peaceful world for their citizens?One of the greatest American patriots, John Adams, wrote that the American Revolution was  effected before the war commenced. The Revolution was in the minds and hearts of the people. That was the moment when America awoke, when we looked around and understood that we were a nation. We realized who we were, what we valued, and what we would give our lives to defend. From its very first moments, the American story is the story of what is possible when people take ownership of their future.The United States of America has been among the greatest forces for good in the history of the world, and the greatest defenders of sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all.Now we are calling for a great reawakening of nations, for the revival of their spirits, their pride, their people, and their patriotism.History is asking us whether we are up to the task. Our answer will be a renewal of will, a rediscovery of resolve, and a rebirth of devotion. We need to defeat the enemies of humanity and unlock the potential of life itself.Our hope is a word and world of proud, independent nations that embrace their duties, seek friendship, respect others, and make common cause in the greatest shared interest of all: a future of dignity and peace for the people of this wonderful Earth.This is the true vision of the United Nations, the ancient wish of every people, and the deepest yearning that lives inside every sacred soul.So let this be our mission, and let this be our message to the world: We will fight together, sacrifice together, and stand together for peace, for freedom, for justice, for family, for humanity, and for the almighty God who made us all.Thank you. God bless you. God bless the nations of the world. And God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much.",Government News,"Sep 19, 2017",27468
HOUSE INTEL Slaps Subpoenas on McCain Institute Associate Involved in “Trump Dirty Dossier” Sources,"Please see our previous report below on the McCain Institute associate who has now been subpoenaed by the House Intel Committee. David J. Kramer was in hot water before for the same reason the Intel Committee is now issuing a subpoena:He was previously subpoenaed by the lawyers for a Russian tech executive suing BuzzFeed. The guy just refuses to give out any information on sources for the  dirty  dossier. This raises the question of if there were sources that were fictional and were used just to build a fake case against Trump. President Trump just tweeted out that the dossier is a  pile of garbage . Could it be that this  pile of garbage  was used to make the case for a FISA warrant to spy on POTUS  The plot thickens on this one The Daily Caller reports: The House Intelligence Committee has issued a subpoena for an associate of Arizona Sen. John McCain s who revealed last week that he knows the names of the Russian sources used in former British spy Christopher Steele s infamous dossier.A congressional source tells The Daily Caller that California Rep. Devin Nunes issued the subpoena on Wednesday for David J. Kramer, a former State Department official.Kramer refused to divulge the names of Steele s sources during a Dec. 19 interview with the panel, the source says.Steele used Russian sources to gather information on the Trump campaign and Donald Trump s activities in Russia. The ex-spy was working for Fusion GPS, an opposition research firm that was on the payroll of the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee.OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON THE MCCAIN ASSOCIATE WHO REFUSED TO SPILL THE BEANS: Lawyers for a Russian tech executive suing BuzzFeed for publishing the Steele dossier say that a longtime associate of Arizona Sen. John McCain and two major news outlets are resisting subpoenas seeking their depositions for the case.In a brief filed in federal court late Wednesday, lawyers for the executive, Aleksej Gubarev, claim that David Kramer (pictured below), a former State Department official and McCain associate,  has been seemingly avoiding service  of a deposition subpoena for weeks.Please see the very curious input Reason.com put out just this July regarding Kramer s involvement in the Steele dossier getting into the hands of the press. And The New York Times and Wall Street Journal are challenging deposition subpoenas they have been served as part of the case.Gubarev s lawyers are attempting to find out who gave BuzzFeed the salacious dossier, which the website published to much controversy on Jan. 10.The dossier, written by former British spy Christopher Steele, alleges that Gubarev and his companies, XBT Holdings and Webzilla, used spam, viruses and porn bots to hack into DNC computer systems. Gubarev vehemently denies the allegations.Gubarev s attorneys say that identifying BuzzFeed s source could shed light on whether the news outlet was warned that information in the dossier could be false. They argue that publishing the dossier despite such warnings would show  reckless disregard for the truth or falsity of the information published. BuzzFeed has defended its decision to publish the dossier, which was financed by the Clinton campaign and DNC and commissioned by opposition research firm Fusion GPS. It is also resisting demands from Gubarev s team to identify its dossier source on the grounds that it would violate its First Amendment protections as a news-gathering organization.Via: Daily CallerReason had this to say on July 16th on the mystery surrounding how the fake dossier got into the hands of Buzzfeed:Did John McCain and a controversial D.C. lobbying group conspire to get the infamous  pee dossier  into the hands of the press?A lawsuit making its way through court in the UK hopes to determine just what role the senator and his associates had in making the lurid dossier public.New filings in the lawsuit, obtained by McClatchy, detail how David Kramer employed by the nonprofit and purportedly non-political McCain Institute acted as a representative of McCain in the Arizona senator s dealings on sensitive intelligence measures:According to a new court document in the British lawsuit, counsel for defendants Steele and Orbis repeatedly point to McCain, R-Ariz., a vocal Trump critic, and a former State Department official as two in a handful of people known to have had copies of the full document before it circulated among journalists and was published by BuzzFeed.

So how did they get from there to publication in Buzzfeed?THE PLOT THICKENS!",Government News,"Dec 27, 2017",4715

WATCH: NBC’S CHUCK TODD Attempts To “Normalize” ANTIFA TERROR GROUP…Interviews DARTMOUTH PROFESSOR Who Claims Violence Against Trump Supporters Is “Self-Defense” and “Ethical”,"Here is an excerpt from their coverage of Todd s interview:After decades of relative obscurity, the fringe  antifa  movement is becoming a household name after followers clashed with white supremacists at the Charlottesville  Unite the Right  rally where extremist Alex Fields is accused of murdering 32-year-old activist Heather Heyer in a car attack.But the movement is still loosely defined and organized, making it difficult to get a grip on its size and aims.Professor Mark Bray, a historian, and lecturer at Dartmouth, has tried to fill the gap in his new book,  Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook,  that chronicles its rise. While Bray doesn t participate in the group s protests, he nonetheless considers himself an ally.Yesterday morning, in advance of the Antifa terror group s attacks on a small group of Trump supporters in Berkeley, NBC s Chuck Todd interviewed Richard Cohen of the radical, leftist Southern Poverty Law Center. Among the many leading questions, Chuck Todd had for the leftist hack Richard Cohen, Todd wanted to help viewers understand how the  sometimes  violent Antifa group is necessary to keep President Trump and his supporters (or  new alt-right groups ) in check.Richard Cohen:  Trump has tremendously energized White Supremacists movement in this country. There s never been a candidate in recent history who s been endorsed by the KKK Cohen goes on to call the people who have backed away from White Supremacists, the  Alt-Light .The what? After Chuck Todd set up the interview with the radical Richard Cohen, he shifted gears to include the pro-Antifa Dartmouth professor Mark Bray in the conversation. Todd conveniently never mentions that Dartmouth University has condemned Professor Bray and his endorsement of violence by Antifa to shut down free speech. Here is a statement from Dartmouth, that NBC s Chuck Todd conveniently glossed over:Here is the statement from Dartmouth, that NBC s Chuck Todd conveniently glossed over:Statement on Lecturer in History Mark Bray August 21, 2017 Recent statements made by Lecturer in History Mark Bray supporting violent protest do not represent the views of Dartmouth. As an institution, we condemn anything but civil discourse in the exchange of opinions and ideas. Dartmouth embraces free speech and open inquiry in all matters, and all on our campus enjoy the freedom to speak, write, listen and debate in pursuit of better learning and understanding; however, the endorsement of violence in any form is contrary to Dartmouth values.

BOOM! BRILLIANT ANDREW MCCARTHY Totally Destroys Any Case Against Trump [Video],"Andrew McCarthy is just awesome! He goes through the reasons why there is nothing on Trump at all. Tucker Carlson even says at the end of the interview that McCarthy should work in the White house I don t know a single person who works at the White House who can explain things the way you can. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAsy2ob28s0You have to love the common sense and brilliance of McCarthy. Here s a great McCarthy piece from the National Review:Finally, something else about those lawyers. I nearly fell out of my chair upon reading the very first paragraph of the notes of Clinton s interview, which identifies the lawyers for Clinton who were permitted to be present for the interview. Among them is Cheryl Mills, Clinton s longtime confidant and chief-of-staff at the State Department.Readers may recall that I suggested back in May that  the fix  was in in the investigation of the Clinton emails. The reason was that the Justice Department was allowing Cheryl Mills   a witness, if not a subject, of the investigation   to invoke attorney-client privilege on behalf of Mrs. Clinton in order to thwart the FBI s attempt to inquire into the procedure used to produce Clinton s emails to the State Department. Mills was a participant in that procedure   and it is the procedure in which, we now know, well over 30,000 emails were attempted to be destroyed, including several thousand that contained government-related business.When she worked for Clinton at State, Mills was not acting in the capacity of a lawyer   not for then-Secretary Clinton and not for the State Department. Moreover, as Clinton s chief-of-staff, Mills was intimately involved in issues related to Clinton s private email set up, the discussions about getting her a secure BlackBerry similar to President Obama s, and questions that were raised (including in FOIA requests) about Clinton s communications.That is to say, Mills was an actor in the facts that were under criminal investigation by the FBI. Put aside that she was not Mrs. Clinton s lawyer while working for the State Department; as I explained in the May column, Mills, after leaving the State Department, was barred by ethical rules from acting as Mrs. Clinton s lawyer  in connection with a matter in which the lawyer participated personally and substantially as a public officer or employee. There is no way Mills should have been permitted to participate as a lawyer in the process of producing Clinton s emails to the State Department nearly two years after they d both left.I thought it was astonishing that the Justice Department indulged her attorney-client privilege claim, which frustrated the FBI s ability to question her on a key aspect of the investigation. But it is simply unbelievable to find her turning up at Mrs. Clinton s interview   participating in the capacity of a lawyer under circumstances where Clinton was being investigated over matters in which Mills participated as a non-lawyer government official.Read more: NRO",politics,"Jun 7, 2017",2994

PRESIDENT TRUMP TO CUBA: Send Back Escaped COP KILLER…Poster Child For Black Lives Matter Movement [VIDEO],"The inspiration behind the  Black Lives Matter  movement   the individual cited by its founder and regularly quoted by its supporters   is a convicted cop killer who is on the FBI s  Most Wanted Terrorists  list.In an article which details the philosophical foundation of  Black Lives Matter , BLM co-founder Garza cites,  Assata s powerful demand in my organizing work. Assata is a reference to Assata Shakur, otherwise known as Joanne Deborah Chesimard, a radical feminist and Marxist revolutionary who escaped from prison in 1979 while serving a life sentence for the murder of New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster.On the night of May 2, 1973, Shakur, along with two other accomplices, killed Foerster execution-style at point-blank range during a routine traffic stop on the New Jersey Turnpike in East Brunswick.For Shakur, the shooting was the culmination of years of militant radicalism during which she joined and left the Black Panther Party because it was not violent enough, before subsequently joining the Black Liberation Army, a domestic terror outfit responsible for bombings and assassinations throughout the 1970 s which claimed the lives of 13 police officers.  InfowarsShe escaped from prison in 1979 and fled to Cuba, where she was granted political asylum, and she s been there ever since.President Trump on Friday demanded that Cuba return notorious New Jersey cop killer Joanne Chesimard to the United States to face justice.During a speech in Miami to announce changes in U.S. policy toward Cuba, Trump said the return of Chesimard and other fugitives was one of several steps the Cuban government needed to take before the longstanding embargo could be lifted. To the Cuban government, I say, put an end to the abuse of dissidents, release the political prisoners, stop jailing innocent people, open yourselves to political and economic freedoms, return the fugitives from American justice, including the return of the cop killer Joanne Chesimard,  aka Assata Shakur Trump said.Following the passing of brutal dictator Fidel Castro, BLM wrote a love note of sorts on Medium, expressing their gratitude for harboring their hero, cop-killer Assata Shakur: A final lesson is that to be a revolutionary, you must strive to live in integrity. As a Black network committed to transformation, we are particularly grateful to Fidel for holding Mama Assata Shakur, who continues to inspire us. We are thankful that he provided a home for Brother Michael Finney Ralph Goodwin, and Charles Hill, asylum to Brother Huey P. Newton, and sanctuary for so many other Black revolutionaries who were being persecuted by the American government during the Black Power era.",left-news,"Jun 16, 2017",2682
 Ted Cruz Birth Certificate Spawns Questions About Illegitimate Birth,"On January 17, Dallas News published a copy of Ted Cruz s birth certificate. The fact that the Republican presidential hopeful was born in Canada is really no big surprise to anyone who has been following the Trump/Cruz birther frenzy.While Cruz s Canadian birth is not a surprise, the fact that his mother is identified as Eleanor Wilson on the candidate s birth certificate, rather than Eleanor Cruz, is.According to Dallas News, Wilson was the name of Cruz s mother s first husband. The couple had been divorced for about seven years at the time Cruz was born.It gets even more interesting when you learn that the former Ms. Wilson gave birth to another child, Michael, approximately three years after her divorce and three before she supposedly married Ted s father, right-wing pastor Rafael Cruz.The baby s name was Michael Wilson. He later died from crib death.In his book, A Time for Truth: Reigniting the Promise of America, Cruz claimed his mother s divorce from Wilson took place in 1965, two years later than the actual date. He also claimed that Michael was born the same year, in 1965, and that the child s death was what ultimately led to the divorce.Unfortunately for Ted, Dallas News verified that the divorce took place in 1963 and that Michael Wilson was born and died in 1966.Dallas News contacted Eleanor Cruz s former husband, Alan Wilson, who was born in Forth Worth Texas,  but has lived in London, England since the 1960 s.During the interview, Wilson said he was not Michael Cruz s father, and he only learned that his ex-wife had given birth by chance. We were divorced and she was living on her own,  said Wilson. He said that Eleanor asked him if she could use his last name on the birth certificate. When Michael Wilson later died, he said,  I hadn t even met the baby. Alan Wilson said by chance he and Eleanor Wilson were being treated in the same hospital when she was pregnant when a nurse told his  his wife  was there   startling the Fort Worthian.  I didn t know she was pregnant. We were definitely divorced. It s interesting that while Rafael and Eleanor Cruz are reported to have married in Texas in 1969, the year before Cruz was born, the state s online public records site does not show a record of the couple s marriage. The exact date of Cruz s parents marriage remain a mystery.The couple divorced in 1997.As the drama over whether Ted Cruz is eligible to run for president began to unfold this month, numerous documents have been published, including Eleanor Cruz s (maiden name Darragh) birth certificate, showing that she was born in the U.S. state of Delaware.In addition to his mother s birth certificate, Talking Points Memo and Breitbart (among other media outlets) also published Ms. Cruz s Canadian voting records. Those records tell us two things. First they tell us that Ms. Cruz was registered to vote in Canada in 1974, a right the country reserves only for legal citizens. Second, the record tell us that the candidate s mother used the name of her second husband, Rafael Cruz on her Canadian voting record.So leaves us to wonder why she used the name of her first husband on Ted Cruz s birth certificate, if indeed she was married to Rafael Cruz at the time Ted was born.None of this would be considered fair game if the candidate wasn t running for the position of God s appointed King of America. It wouldn t be fair game if Ted and Rafael Cruz had not made ridiculous and insulting statements about single mothers and unwed mothers. It would not be fair game if Ted Cruz had not appointed himself as a spiritual dictator to the masses.Most importantly, though, the birther movement that viciously attacked President Obama throughout his first term as president used the word  illegitimate,  as a matter of routine, when referring to the leader of our country.Ted Cruz spent a lot of time catering to the right-wing extremists who viciously attacked the leader our country.Apparently he never expected any of that to catch up to him.But now a lot of people are not only asking if Cruz is able to be a legitimate president, they re asking if Cruz is even the legitimate son of the religiously insane Rafael Cruz.Maybe Ted should have read that Bible he likes to wave around in front of the crowd. After all, it does warn that eventually  you will reap what you sow. Featured image credit: Gage Skidmore, via Flckr cc 2.0",News,"January 17, 2016",4381
GOP EVIDENCE: Comey FBI Busted Giving Clinton ‘Special Status’…Those Responsible STILL At FBI! [Video],"Friday on Fox News Channel s  Fox & Friends,  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) said evidence had been uncovered showing that the FBI gave the investigation of 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton s improper use of an unauthorized email server while secretary of state a  special status. According to the Florida Republican, who is also a member of the House Judiciary Committee, the process afforded to Clinton was different than it would have been for  any other American. We now have evidence that the FBI s investigation of Hillary Clinton did not follow normal and standard procedures,  he said.  The current deputy director of the FBI Andrew McCabe sent emails just weeks before the presidential election saying that the Hillary Clinton investigation would be special   that it would be handled by a small team at headquarters, that it would be given special status. GOETZ CALLED FOR AN IMMEDIATE INVESTIGATION: I am immediately calling for an investigation into the special treatment that the FBI gave Hillary Clinton. Rep. Gaetz: ""I am immediately calling for an investigation into the special treatment that the FBI gave Hillary Clinton."" #IngrahamAngle pic.twitter.com/EHkQfyeWDK  Fox News (@FoxNews) November 22, 2017Ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee Goetz is calling for an investigation into why Hillary Clinton s FBI case was labelled  special  by the FBI s Andrew McCabe:The Hill reports:Shortly before last year s election, FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe wrote an email on his official government account stating that the Hillary Clinton email probe had been given  special  status, according to documents released Wednesday.McCabe s Oct. 23, 2016, email to press officials in the FBI said the probe was under the control of a small group of high-ranking people at the FBI s headquarters in Washington. As I now know the decision was made to investigate it at HQ with a small team,  McCabe wrote in the email. He said he had no input when the Clinton email investigation started in summer 2015, while he was serving as assistant director in charge of the FBI s Washington office. [The Washington office] provided some personnel for the effort but it was referred to as a  special  and I was not given any details about it,  he wrote.FBI officials on Wednesday night refused to answer what McCabe meant by calling the Clinton email probe a  special  or why it was restricted to a small team at headquarters when it began. We don t have anything to add to the documents that were released,  bureau spokeswoman Carol Cratty wrote The Hill.The note was contained in more than 70 pages of emails the FBI released on its public records site known as The Vault.The emails chronicled McCabe s efforts to address a separate controversy involving his wife s 2015 campaign for political office.McCabe s references to a  special  status for the Clinton probe are likely to be used as ammunition by Republican lawmakers critical of former FBI Director James Comey s handling of the Clinton investigation.Remember that the DOJ s Loretta Lynch also wanted Clinton s case to be called an  incident  and not an investigation. It looks like all intel agencies were doing all they could to protect Clinton. Was it to save themselves from exposure in the Uranium One case or something else?",Government News,"Nov 25, 2017",3308
 WATCH: Texas Judge Orders Newly Sworn-In Citizens To Accept Trump Or Leave The Country,"Demanding allegiance to a head of state as a condition for becoming a citizen sounds like something a dictator would do.And that s exactly what a Texas judge did during a swearing-in ceremony for immigrants who have been waiting to become citizens of the United States.John Primono is a federal judge who has sworn in over 100,000 new citizens during his career. But the election of Donald trump has apparently emboldened him to violate all sense of judicial ethics and human decency to warn new citizens that they better accept Trump as their president or else. I can assure you that whether you voted for him or you did not vote for him, if you are a citizen of the United States, he is your president,  Primono told the new citizens as they were forced to listen.  He will be your president, and if you do not like that, you need to go to another country. Here s the video via KENS.This is a pretty damn disgraceful thing to say to a group of people who clearly want to be Americans, especially from a federal judge.And Primono is paying the price for his partisanship because he was removed from presiding over any future citizenship ceremonies by the U.S. District judges.Of course, conservatives are very pleased and have made Primono their new hero, which alone should force him off the bench because it is clear that he is unable to exercise good judgement and political neutrality.But Primono claimed that he was merely offering a message of  unity  and that his remarks were taken out of context. I would never say anything like that,  Primono told KENS.  I wasn t trying to say anything for or against Donald Trump. I was just trying to say something hopeful and unifying, and unfortunately it was taken out of context. Yeah, that s complete bullshit. Telling new American citizens to support Trump or else is not  unifying.  It s a threatening message designed to scare immigrants into blindly following Trump.Immigrants should not have to deal with such threats in this country, where we have the right to political dissent. And the way Trump has treated immigrants over the last year and half makes it clear that he doesn t respect them. He hates them. So it s understandable that immigrants would be opposed to Trump s presidency. But they are not alone. Americans overwhelmingly voted against Donald Trump but he somehow won via the electoral vote. Millions of Americans are protesting against Trump and his bigotry.On a day when this group of diverse people finally became American citizens, this federal judge marred the ceremony by invoking the name of a divisive hatemonger and literally ordered them to accept Trump as their leader. It should never have happened but it makes one wonder how many more judges are going to become emboldened to behave similarly once Trump takes over in January.Featured image: Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"November 22, 2016",2851
 Trump’s Russia Connection Says US Troops Lives Are In Danger,"A former top aide to Donald Trump makes an alarming reference to the safety of American troops in a letter sent to Senator John McCain. In the note, Carter Page insists that an attempt from McCain, Sen. Lindsey Graham, and other Republicans interested in probing the role Russia played in the 2016 election could impact U.S. national security.Page previously served as a foreign policy adviser to Trump, and was under FBI investigation for his communications with the Russian government.In the letter, released to the propaganda site Sputnik (which is financed by the Russian government), Page wrote: Any efforts by members of Congress now to undercut potential new approaches to Russia would risk U.S. national security and innumerable service members lives,  Page said in a letter to McCain, who serves as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, sent late on Tuesday. American citizens are largely tired of failed interventionist policies.   The number of proxy wars involving Washington and Moscow across the globe still put countless lives at risk today,  Page wrote.The Trump team has mounted a full-court press opposing any attempt to investigate and probe Russian attempts to influence the election. Trump himself, responding to President Obama s expulsion of Russian spies and hackers, urged the government to move on from the hacking.The letter from Page appears to be the latest in a coordinated push back on attempts to provide accountability after the election. Republicans have been in an odd position as a result. After decades of pushing back on Russian government, including many of the public statements from Ronald Reagan, they are now backing their incoming president and his praise for the most authoritarian Russian government in decades under Vladimir Putin.By contrast, Democrats have been alarmed at the Russian behavior and Republican disinterest in making them accountable.Featured image via Flickr",News,"December 31, 2016",1933
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT: Firing Workers With Expired Papers Is Discrimination? Outrageous!

 WATCH: Navy Unveils The Latest Reason We Can’t Afford National Healthcare (VIDEO),"A new war toy for the Navy was shown off recently in an article published in the Wall Street Journal.The  supergun  as the WSJ s headline refers to it, is really just a large railgun. A railgun is a weapon that uses an electromagnetic charge to fire a round rather than chemical explosives.The only time that cost is mentioned in the article is when it compares the cost of using a railgun projectile versus that of a standard missile. The WSJ reports that each projectile only costs around $25,000 dollars to make, compared to the cost of a $10-million-dollar interceptor missile.  Wow, it almost sounds as if this thing might actually save the military some money in the long-term. It won t though, it s just another military pipe dream that ll end up costing tax payers an arm and a leg   possibly literally seeing as the money that could go towards building these things might have gone to something useful, like a universal national health insurance program.The weapon requires a massive power source the rail gun requires 25 megawatts to work. As Vice pointed out in an article published last year, this need for a huge power source is the reason this technology is going to be quite costly, or even possibly impossible to make practical for a long time. It s hard to conceptualize 25 megawatts, for me anyway. For some perspective, th e Navy s next generation Zumwalt-class destroyer, the 21st-century stealth battleship with electric engines, is powered by a 78-megawatt array of turbine generators. So, firing a rail gun once would take almost a third of the most advanced ship s whole capacity. Most ships today don t have more than 9 megawatts to spare. . . The railgun is going to be tested on the USNS Millinocket next year. The first of three Zumwalt-class ships railgun or no railgun is slated to be delivered to the Navy next year, and the last in 2018. They re estimated to cost $22 billion in total. The bigger problem here is that the United States is entering into a new Cold War era, except this time it is with both Russia and China. Projects like this may give the U.S. a small military advantage over one of these two nations for a few years at least. Then we will have to spend billions upon billions of dollars on new weapons systems that everyone is terrified of actually using, considering the chance that a full nuclear response is a possibility.We have to really ask ourselves is this the road we want the U.S. to go down. Of course, we cannot leave ourselves defenseless but we seriously have to make decisions about what we invest our money into. How exactly do we plan to use these weapons systems, should they ever actually become practical? We also have to ask ourselves if it is more important to spend countless billions of dollars on weapons that are built-in, the justification of defense against the Next Bad Thing, yet will probably end up just being used to  spread a little democracy  to poor nations.I, for one, would prefer to invest in building a nation that makes sure that every person is given the opportunity to get an education, see a doctor, or breath clean air and drink clean water than one that is hell-bent on winning another cold war.You can watch a video of the railgun below.

ANTI-TRUMP Communications Specialist For UN Arrested In NYC For Robbing Banks During Lunch,"A United Nations employee was busted for robbing four Manhattan banks   all during his lunch hour, authorities said.Only 3 weeks ago, the anti-Trump UN worker warned on Facebook that some  dubious characters are betraying us  and that he would reveal names later. (see post below).Abdullahi Shuaibu, 53, was picked up by cops Monday and hit with two counts of robbery and two counts of attempted robbery for the crimes committed during his two-month spree.Abdullah Shuaibu s LinkedIn account states that he lives in New York and is currently employed by the UN as a  Communications Specialist .A photo from Shuaibu s Facebook page shows him standing with UN General Assembly President Morgens Lykketoft. Abdullah Shuaibu s Facebook page includes several anti-Trump posts like this one where he hilariously refers to  The New Yorker  as  one of America s most prestigious magazines LOL!So a guy who works for the UN and holds up banks on his lunch hours is concerned about a private conversation Trump had with another guy on a bus? Shuaibu claims  racism  is the  Trump card  in this post: All four banks are within walking distance of UN headquarters on First Ave. near E. 42nd St., where the Nigeria native works as a journalist for an African news agency, police said.Authorities were led to the thief after a retired police officer who works at the facility recognized Shuaibu from a surveillance image previously released by the NYPD.In the first incident, Shuaibu walked into a Santander Bank on Madison Ave. near E. 43rd St. on Feb. 27 and told the teller he had a gun. The bank employee complied and handed Shuaibu an unknown sum of money.He hit two more banks during the month of March, first striking out at a Bank of America on Third Ave. near E. 47th St. on the 13th.

She couldn t satisfy her husband how is she going to satisfy a whole country? Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, Sean Smith, Tyrone Woods, and Glen Doherty. Because she s morally bankrupt! Judge Jeanine: Hillary Clinton is only out for herself. She is the poster child for what s wrong with our government. She is a criminal. She is a liar. She has accomplished nothing. I don t believe in socialism. The left believes in the supremacy of govt over the individual. Do you want tyranny or liberty? I don t believe in political dynasties.

 ‘Responsible Gun Owner’ Who Shot His Girlfriend Beaten Unconscious By Partygoers (VIDEO),"According to the NRA,  good guys with guns  across the nation are the last line of defense between some unspecified threat that could occur anywhere at any time, and something else. But who will protect the world from the  responsible gun owners  who prove themselves to be anything BUT responsible?In the latest instance of  responsible gun ownerness,  a Utah man found himself beaten to a pulp by people who were leaving a party at his home after he shot his girlfriend. According to ABC4 Utah, everyone was enjoying the all-night party until the unnamed man began fighting with his significant other. Overcome by emotion, he  responsibly  pulled out a handgun and demanded that partygoers leave his home.Obviously, confronted by a presumably drunk individual who thinks a gun is the best way to get people to leave a party, those present quickly left   but as they were in the driveway, they heard gunshots. Unified Police Department spokesperson Lex Bell says that the heroic individuals rushed back inside and pummeled the shooter, who left his victim with gunshot wounds to her ankle and hand, until he was unconscious.In an apparent effort to protect the shooter, the girlfriend told police that she  accidentally  shot herself while cleaning the gun   but law enforcement says that she was likely shot while trying to wrestle the gun away from her violent and crazy significant other. A friend who drove her to the hospital confirmed that her story was false. Fortunately, her injuries are not serious, though she may need surgery on her hand.According to area residents, the couple recently moved into the neighborhood   and after learning about their new neighbors, they are a bit concerned. One man, identified as  Dan,  called the incident  troublesome  because he has a family whose safety is placed at risk by the new  responsible gun owners  in the neighborhood.No charges have yet been filed, but Bell says that those who rushed in and heroically beat the living hell out of the shooter were likely, legally, justified.Watch a report on the attack below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"April 25, 2016",2099
ARCHITECT OF MASS VOTER FRAUD: Hollywood Producer Tells Stunning Story Of How Obama Stole Election In 2008,"The Clintons were the original  birthers,  Viviano told WND in an interview in Los Angeles. Everybody who has called this a conspiracy from the Republicans or the tea party, they need to know who started it   the Democrats,  she said. It was Hillary and Bill, and it percolated up from there,  said Viviano, who had access to the campaign through a documentary she produced on the claims of delegates that Obama and the Democratic National Committee were stealing the nomination from Hillary.Viviano said that she was on a conference phone call during the primary season in the spring of 2008 in which she heard Bill Clinton refer to Obama as ineligible for the presidency.In the course of the phone conversation with Hillary delegates, she recalled, Bill Clinton spoke of Obama as  the non-citizen. In the world we were in, with [Hillary s] super-delegates and delegates, it just was,  He s not legit   that s the end of it, period, end of story.  It wasn t up for discussion,  Viviano said.Michele Thomas, a Hillary campaigner from Los Angeles, confirmed to WND that she learned from  many people who were close to Hillary  that Obama  was not eligible to be president. Thomas led a nationwide petition drive among delegates to force a vote on Hillary s nomination at the convention after then-DNC Chairman Howard Dean announced her name would not be put into nomination and Obama would be declared the winner by unanimous acclamation.Viviano said that it was understood that Bill Clinton would eventually go public with his contention that Obama was ineligible for the presidency. He, I believe, was frothing at the mouth to tell the truth about Obama,  she said.In the meantime, she recalled, the former president would make ironic references in public in which he  teetered  on revealing he position. He would go on camera,  Viviano said,  and jokingly make comments about, you know,  Is Obama qualified to be president? Well, if he s 35 and a wink, wink, United States citizen, I guess he s qualified. She claimed, however, that Bill Clinton s intention to unequivocally state to the public that Obama was ineligible was stopped in its tracks by the murder of a close friend of the Clintons, Arkansas Democratic Party Chairman Bill Gwatney, just two weeks before the Democratic National Convention in Denver.Gwatney was killed Aug. 13, 2008, when a 50-year-old man entered Democratic Party headquarters in Little Rock and shot him three times. Police killed the murderer after a chase, and investigators found no motive.The Clintons said in a statement that they were  stunned and shaken  by the killing of their  cherished friend and confidante. Viviano said a campaign staffer who was close to Hillary, whose name she requested be withheld for security reasons, told her Gwatney s murder was a message to Bill Clinton. I was told by this person that that was  Shut up, Bill, or you re next,  she said.The campaign adviser, according to Viviano, said that despite the intimidation and threats, Bill Clinton was prepared to speak out about Obama s eligibility And then,  Viviano said, paraphrasing the staffer,  they went in and said,  OK, it s your daughter, now, we ll go after. And then Bill never said anything. Others in the campaign who believe Gwatney s murder was a message to the Clintons think it had to do with the fact that Gwatney was resisting an effort by the Obama campaign and the party to intimidate Hillary delegates into voting for Obama.But Viviano argues that California delegates also were rebelling, and she says her source told her the same story two years later.Since the 2008 campaign, Clinton has insisted publicly that Obama is eligible for the White House.He weighed in on the issue in an April 2011 interview with ABC s  Good Morning America,  when Donald Trump was urging Obama to release his long-form birth certificate to the public. If I were them, I d be really careful riding that birther horse too much,  Clinton said.  Everyone knows it s ludicrous.

 Right-Wingers Actually HONOR The Cops Who Killed Freddie Gray (VIDEO),"The Media Research Center, a right-wing media analysis organization, held its annual black-tie affair last week. The Baltimore police officers who are directly responsible for the death of Freddie Gray last year attended, were brought up on stage, and applauded and honored and giving a standing ovation for their work, all while a right-wing talking head glossed over the problems of police brutality.Deneen Borelli, a frequent Fox News contributor, complained loudly that these cops  lives and careers were ruined by the  lies  surrounding Freddie Gray s death. Gray died after his spine was nearly severed due to a rough and unsecured ride in the back of a van. He was handcuffed and put in leg irons, but not belted in at all. Later, officers said he d suffered a medical emergency, but they failed to get him help.Borelli lamented: These five men and one woman, all veteran police officers, were now in handcuffs, fighting for their lives, their careers destroyed, bankrupted, humiliated No one apologized for ruining their lives. No one thanked them for their service or recognized their honor. Who will thank these officers? Who will thank all police officers   at a time they are being so vilified? Tonight, ladies and gentlemen, we will. This is disgusting.Patently disgusting.The media doesn t jump to vilify the police   we have a serious problem with police brutality, particularly against the black community, and the media is shining a light on it. In Baltimore, officers who were witnesses to the case were also on the team investigating Gray s death. Lead detectives started their own counter-investigations to disprove the state s case. The system works for officers, and against their victims.Victims like Freddie Gray. While Borelli whines that nobody s apologized to these officers who, in her view no doubt, were merely doing their duty and then braved the aftermath with grace and courage, Gray is still dead. He died as a direct result of these officers  actions.To point this out, though, makes us anti-police. We re police-haters when we point out brutality. Idiots like Franklin Graham say the best way to stop this is for people to just comply with police orders, and yet, many of the black people who die are complying with police orders.Seriously, the Media Research Center ought to be ashamed of itself for this. These cops  lives and careers wouldn t have been ruined if they d actually done their entire job.Watch Borelli s remarks below, beginning at the 1:11:50 mark:Featured image via screen capture",News,"September 27, 2016",2534
NOT FUNNY! What These “MORONS” Did For Crooked Hillary Should FRIGHTEN Every American [VIDEO],"It s easy to see why there are so many Americans who would rather keep their heads firmly buried in the sand than know the truth about how inept our government officials really are Hillary Clinton is facing damaging new revelations about the lax security surrounding her emails.Watch Hillary try to make voters believe she is a  victim  in this insane security risk she has subjected our entire nation to:A Daily Mail Online investigation has found that a second firm   hired to store a back-up of Clinton s secret server   was so lax in its security employees failed to change passwords frequently and left computers logged in, unattended for extended periods and its own clients stumbled upon other clients data.Datto Inc, the company in question, was hired to store Hillary s emails by Platte River, the mom-and-pop company contracted to maintain her  homebrew  email system.Speaking exclusively to Daily Mail Online on condition of anonymity, one former employee at Datto, said the company was woefully exposed to being hacked. If you re talking about high-level data security, at the political, presidential level, the security level of data [at Datto] hired by Platte River, was nowhere near something that could have been protected from a good hacker that knows how to spread out their points at which to infiltrate,  he said.The emails emails, 30,000 of which Clinton deleted, are now part of an FBI investigation into her handling of classified material while she was Secretary of State.A total of 22 have been deemed to contain top secret material   out of 2,075 found to contain classified material   and questions have mounted about whether her account was successfully hacked, which the Clinton campaign claims did not happen.The existence of the emails only came to light because of a House investigation into the deaths of four American in an Islamist attack on the mission in Benghazi, Libya, on September 11 2012.The probe concluded this week with an excoriating report by the majority Republican members of the committee, who accused her of  shameful  conduct with her secret email account.Clinton dismissed the report, saying it was time to  move on  and went to California to launch her policies on the tech industry.But now it can be disclosed that Datto Inc is accused of major security failings by people who worked for it and also those who used its services.The failings included allegations that security was so lax that customers warned the firm they had stumbled on other clients  data; that in 2010, the company s internal servers were hacked; and that staff were not required to regularly change passwords, seen as a basic requirement for keeping systems secure.Staff computers   which had access to servers holding confidential client information   were left logged in while unoccupied for extended periods of time, whistleblowers said.And Datto headquarters were easily accessible and had no security guards on their floor, while employees opened and held doors open for others which should only have been accessible with a security pass.A longtime Datto partner, Marc Tamarin, told Daily Mail Online:  Those guys were really morons. They weren t qualified to handle our back-up and that was the biggest concern for us. The former employee speaking exclusively to Daily Mail Online on condition of anonymity, spent three years at Datto, and said the company was woefully exposed to being hacked. It s not something that Datto was focused on. It was more about getting the data off-site quickly and cost-effectively than securing the data and keeping it from being hacked. There s no doubt in my mind that someone could easily hack them   even today. Datto was named last October as the second data storage company to be investigated by the FBI over what threat Clinton s server posed to national security.One of the Datto insiders told Daily Mail Online that around 2010, the startup had its internal network hacked, leading to the authorities being called.

 Donald Trump Jr. Throws Massive Hissy Fit Over Johnny Depp’s Bad Joke,"Donald Trump Jr. is so furious over Johnny Depp s bad assassination joked that he wants Disney to fire the actor.Speaking in England on Thursday, Depp made a joke about actors assassinating presidents. When was the last time an actor assassinated a president? I want to clarify,  he continued,  I m not an actor. I lie for a living. However, it s been awhile, and maybe it s time. By the way, this is going to be in the press and it ll be horrible,  Depp acknowledged.  It s just a question; I m not insinuating anything. Well, the Pirates of the Caribbean star was right about the last part. His comments did end up  in the press  and it was  horrible.  Depp quickly realized that this bad joke was a mistake and apologized just hours later. I apologize for the bad joke I attempted last night in poor taste about President Trump,  he said in a statement to PEOPLE magazine.  It did not come out as intended, and I intended no malice. I was only trying to amuse, not to harm anyone. To be clear, no, jokes like this are not acceptable, especially in today s tense political climate. But Donald Trump Jr. is absolutely beside himself over Depp s remarks and so he did what all Trumps do: he threw a temper tantrum all over Twitter. Junior s goal? To make sure Depp never works for Disney again.I d think it would be hard for @Disney to keep him, let s see: #FireDepp Goes VIRAL after  Trump Assassination  Joke https://t.co/CXOzVl6r6t  Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) June 24, 2017Donnie s hashtag was a flop and never did go viral like he had hoped and nobody else seems to really give a damn about getting Depp fired from Disney because he made a bad joke about assassinating Trump.For some unknown reason, Trump s eldest son also decided to drag Senator Dianne Feinstein into the fun. Because, why not.But I bet she s a YUGE Johnny Depp fan. https://t.co/ErKr0QyAtd  Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) June 24, 2017It is worth noting, just one more time, that for eight years every right-wing nutjob in the country called for President Obama to be lynched.

MACY’S CELEBRATES AMERICA’S INDEPENDENCE BY PUTTING ILLEGAL ALIENS FIRST,"Americans need to put American citizens first and dump Macy s.

Tell them it s time to put American citizens first and you appreciate Donald Trump standing up for LEGAL immigration: 1 (800) 289-6229  I ll be canceling my Macy s credit card today. Macy s just lost its  Magic #MakeAmericaGreatAgain .Dump Macy s!Real-estate mogul and GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump called for a boycott of Macy s on Wednesday after the retail company said it would drop Trump s products. Earlier in the day, Macy s said it was snubbing Trump because of the  disparaging characterizations  he made about Mexican immigrants during his campaign launch. Among other things, Trump accused Mexico of sending its  rapists  and drug dealers to the US.In addition to blasting Macy s in an official statement, Trump attacked Macy s in a series of tweets for being  weak on border security : Those who believe in tight border security, stopping illegal immigration & SMART trade deals w/other countries should boycott @Macys.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 1, 2015For all of those who want to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain, boycott @Macys. They are weak on border security & stopping illegal immigration.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 1, 2015Macy s is only the latest in a string of businesses that have cut ties with Trump in the past week. NBC, Univision, and the Mexican media company Televisa all recently announced they would not show Trump s Miss Universe Organization beauty pageants because of his comments about immigrants. When Mexico sends its people, they re not sending their best; they re not sending you,  Trump said in his June announcement speech, according to a transcript.  They re sending people that have lots of problems, and they re bringing those problems with us. They re bringing drugs. They re bringing crime. They re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people. Trump, who said he was criticizing the Mexican government and not its people, has aggressively responded to the companies that are ending their relationships with him. He said he was suing Univision for $500 million. He denounced NBC as  weak.  And he insisted that he was the one cutting ties with Macy s   not the other way around.He also argued that the Macy s snub proved how difficult it was for billionaires like him to seek political office. I have always said that if you are successful, it is very hard to run for office, especially the office of president,  he said in his Wednesday statement.  I have also continually stated that I am not beholden to anyone, and this includes NBC and Macy s. Clearly, NBC and Macy s support illegal immigration.

 Five Women Donald Trump Allegedly Slept With And How They Utterly Humiliated Him,"Donald Trump obviously has a knack for purchasing beautiful women. His first wife, Ivana, was a model from the Czech Republic who was famous for gaudy accessories and over-spending. Trump cheated on her and eventually married Marla Maples, who may have actually loved him for some reason but grew tired of him and moved on with a good chunk of his money. His current wife, Melania, is yet another Eastern European model who loves the lavish lifestyle he provides for her.In between the women who have allowed him to buy them, after the millions of dollars in divorce costs, Trump has always declared himself something of a ladies man. He and his ahem giant hands have been telling stories of his conquests for decades. The problem is, just like everything else about Trump, the stories are mostly exaggerations, outright lies or rumors that he enjoyed a little bit too much to dispel in good conscience like a decent human being. Go figure. Here s a list of five of the famous women Donald Trump has lied about dating and how they humiliated him when they had made his list:The former Olympic champion ice-skater was 41-years-old and happily married when her supposed affair with The Donald happened. After The New York Daily News reported her as a possible Trump fling, she felt she needed to respond since Trump decided not to dispel the rumor: The reason I m going public with my outrage over this allegation is that I had hoped that Donald Trump would issue his own statement of the rumor being completely unfounded, and that has not happened quickly enough,  she said.  I ve been around Donald Trump four times in my life. I wouldn t even call him a good friend. Ouch. Even though that happened in 1990, you just know it still stings the orange man s ego.The Dynasty Star who played Princess Diana in two TV movies told People that there was no truth at all to the rumors she and Trump were an item. Again Trump remained silent, allowing himself to be associated with yet another beautiful woman far out of his league: [He s] a complete joke as far as I m concerned. I hardly know the man,  Oxenburg told People in 1990.And another one down. No wonder he allowed his actual affair with Maples to go public. His reputation was taking a severe beating.The cosmetics mogul refused to give any credence to the rumor she and Trump were a thing, dispelling it with a simple  I don t know what you re talking about,  when asked by People. Trump never attempted to call her out, because the rumors he allowed to continue were obviously not true.The prominent swimsuit model and wife of NHL star Ron Greschner never bothered to answer the allegations she was into Trump. She allowed her manager, Steve Gutstein, to do it for her instead: Donald Trump is a fortunate man, but he s not that fortunate. That s another one that had to just hurt. Trump could very well have avoided all of the humiliation by telling the truth about these rumors when they happened   or by not starting them if he was the source   but he instead rode the wave of ignorance that has carried him towards the Republican nomination 26 years later.The socialite and designer who was married to Trump s billionaire acquaintance Henry Kravitz (it s a well-established fact that Trump doesn t have friends), said the rumors were  ridiculous.  She added,  I m married to the greatest man in the world.  Those are words Trump has probably heard quite often himself   after he buys something extravagant.To his credit, there was one rumor Trump decided to debunk on his own. In the prime of Mike Tyson s career, Trump was accused of a fling with Robin Givens. It s not too difficult to figure out why. Featured image From Getty Images, modified",News,"April 15, 2016",3706

MUSLIM TEENS Stage Fake Terrorist Attack In MN Movie Theater…Guess Who They Blame?,"Oh and as an added bonus, according to one of the Muslim teens, they snuck into the theater as well In addition to faking hate crimes against themselves, Muslims are now resorting to staging fake terrorist attacks to prove how Islamophobic America is. First there was Clock Boy in Texas, then The Muslim Hipsters in Arkansas, and now it s the Muslim Movie Goers in Minnesota. A group of Muslim teens did their best to make movie theater patrons think they were about to launch an attack with some purposely-suspicious actions recently.It turns out the Mall of America isn t just a place for angry black protesters; it s also a great spot for creating a false Islamophobic response. The City Pages reports that on January 1st a group of African Muslim teenagers, possibly from Somalia, went to a movie at the country s largest mall. They were all carrying backpacks and speaking with heavy accents and foreign tongues. They wanted to be noticed.Once the movie began, the 5 or so black Muslims got up and separated, taking seats away from each other. As you can imagine, the rest of the people in the theater thought this was a pretty unusual thing for them to do. In fact, most of the other moviegoers thought these Muslim teens were about to launch a jihad right then and there.Reportedly, as many as 15 movie patrons left the theater and called the police, fearing that radical Islamic inspired bloodshed was eminent. The police and mall security arrived and detained the Muslims. They explained to the officers that they got up and moved away from each other because they didn t want to be tempted to talk to each other during the film, which sounds like a complete load of shit.One of the Muslims, Akram Oromo, took video of the cordial police officers questioning him and his co-conspirators and posted it to his FaceBook page. He also pointed out how racist this intrusion was:Racism well never stop ima let u know that because this white people though this young Muslim teens going to blow up the movie theater because we all have a backpack. More than 15 whites start running from the theater like we about do some stupid shit they called police and moa security but they didn t find anything from usAccording to the video, in addition to freaking people out, Oromo and his friends also snuck into the movie without paying.// <![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_GB/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3"";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]>Racism well never stop ? ima let u know that because this white people though this young Muslim teens going to blow up the movie theater because we all have a backpack.

Radical Islamic groups have actually called for a hit on the Mall of America. It is not racist or Islamophobic for people to react to obvious Muslims acting in a very suspicious manner. That is called vigilance. Even Muslim apologist Barack Obama has said that Americans should keep their eyes open and report anything that doesn t seem right as a way to combat terrorism.It s my opinion that these Muslim teens did this on purpose with the goal of triggering a police response so they could cry about the unfair treatment they receive in the US. Terrorism is evolving, but so too is hate crime hoaxing. It s really quite simple: go to a public place, do something technically legal yet terribly suspicious, then sit back and reap the liberal media sympathy.Via: DownTrend",left-news,"Jan 8, 2016",3874

It does give a healthy tax break to the wealthy, though. It s a great plan if you re rich, but if you re of low-income status and/or older, you re fucked.Each crazy-time tweet of Trump s is well calculated. It s a distraction from his many scandals.

 Giuliani’s PATHETIC Excuse For Trump’s Bragging About Sexual Assault Will Disgust You,"A tape featuring Donald Trump proudly boasting about sexually assaulting women has rocked the GOP this weekend. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is trying to brush it off as no big deal, arguing that men just  talk like that.  But CNN s Jake Tapper did not let him get away with this pathetic excuse.Appearing on State of the Union this Sunday morning, the former NYC mayor tried in vain to convince everybody that this was just locker talk and voters should still support Trump, even if he does brag about grabbing women  by the p*ssy. This is talk, and gosh almighty, he who hasn t sinned, throw the first stone,  Giuliani said of Trump s remarks on the leaked tape from 2005.Tapper cut him off and slammed Giuliani s bullshit argument.  Mr. Mayor, I have never said that. I have never done that,  Tapper said.  I am happy to throw a stone. I have been in locker rooms, I have been a member of a fraternity. I have never heard any man, ever, brag about being able to maul women because they get away with it. Giuliani wasn t dissuaded and continued to insist that this is just how men are. The fact is men, at times, talk like that. Not all men. Tapper asked the former mayor if he had ever said these kinds of things, but Giuliani just kept talking and pretended not to have heard the question. Giuliani then insisted:  I m not justifying it.  But he also never denied having made comments like this himself.Earlier in the interview, Giuliani said that Trump had apologized for his behavior and was likely to do so again during the upcoming debate on Sunday night. He apologized for them, he said that he was wrong, that doesn t reflect the way he looks at things today,  Giuliani said.  He made a full and complete apology for it, and I think he s going to do it again tonight.

 New Info Reveals The TRUE Lengths Trump Went To In Order To Stop FBI’s Russia Probe,"It s well known by now that Trump unsuccessfully pressured Comey to end the FBI s investigation into Michael Flynn and Russia. Many might think that his attempts to pressure authorities to end that investigation ended with Comey, or maybe Attorney General Jeff Sessions. They didn t. A new report from the Washington Post details how Trump went after his newly confirmed Director of National Intelligence, Daniel Coats, on this same subject. [Trump] then started complaining about the FBI investigation and Comey s handling of it, said officials familiar with the account Coats gave to associates. Two days earlier, Comey had confirmed in a congressional hearing that the bureau was probing whether Trump s campaign coordinated with Russia during the 2016 race  The interaction with Coats indicates that Trump aimed to enlist top officials to have Comey curtail the bureau s probe. After that, Trump spoke to Coats again and asked him to publicly deny the existence of any evidence of collusion between his campaign and Russia. He made a similar request of Mike Rogers, the director of the National Intelligence Agency. Both of them refused to do what Trump wanted them to do.Trump is likely upset that he can t control every part of the executive branch like he no doubt thought he would. Nominating and confirming people who have a modicum of integrity, as well as knowledge of how the intelligence community and White House should behave with respect to each other, has only served to push Trump into a very uncomfortable corner.While Trump and his allies continue to deny that anything ever happened, up to and including lying through their teeth, we have to ask one question: If Trump knows he s innocent, why try to interfere in the investigations this way? Why behave like there s a cover-up? Once again, none of this is the behavior of an innocent man. It s the behavior of someone with something to hide.Featured image via Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images",News,"June 7, 2017",1966

"DESPERATE TO STOP THE FLOW OF MUSLIM REFUGEES INTO SWEDEN, Swedish Citizens Devise A Controversial Scheme","The liberals find this plan to be disgusting until their neighborhoods become the next victim of violent muslim immigrant gangs of course Anti-immigration campaigners in Gullberg in southern Sweden are plotting to build a pig farm next to an asylum centre in a last-ditch effort to deter would-be Muslim immigrants, who might find the animals offensive.More illegal immigrants on the run in Sweden (03 May 15) Swedish Syrian warms hearts over phone return (08 Apr 15)  It was a long journey and some of my friends died  (30 Mar 15)Plans for a new immigration centre in Gullberg have already been strongly opposed by local residents and on Wednesday it was reported that a group of campaigners had sent a letter to the Swedish Migration Board (Migrationsverket) pledging to breed pigs nearby in order to deter Muslims from seeking asylum in the town.The note, signed by what described itself as the  interest group for Gullberg s survival  said that it was trying to create a  probably impossible situation for some religious people, especially Muslims , according to Sveriges Radio.Local politician Henry Sandahl from Sweden s Countryside Party (Markbygdspartiet) told the broadcaster that he agreed with the sentiment of the letter. You know that Muslims are not friends with pigs,  he said.But Swedish religious experts have been quick to criticize the campaigners. This is nonsense and shows just how very little they know about Islam,  said  ke Sander, Professor of Psychology at the University of Gothenburg. It is one thing when Muslims try to stay away from pork, alcohol or gambling but there is nothing [in the Koran] that says you cannot be near pigs. This is a last-ditch effort when they [the campaigners] have no arguments left,  he told the TT news agency.Others turned to social media to voice their disgust at the campaign.Carl G ransson, a lawyer and former Moderate party politician suggested on Twitter that building  a gigantic rubbish dump  next to the asylum centre instead, designed to blow smelly winds in the direction of the angry residents. Monstrous  and a  total fail , wrote Johan Arenius, a political press secretary for the Christian Democrat party based in  rebro in central Sweden.Sweden became the first European country in 2013 to grant automatic residency to Syrian refugees and has since seen asylum requests rise to record levels, which are still expected to reach about 90,000 in 2015.To cope with an increasing flow of refugees, the Swedish Migration Board announced in March that it was more than tripling the maximum number of residents allowed at asylum centres from 200 to 650.Via: The Local seh/t Refugee Resettlement Watch",Government News,"May 8, 2015",2669
" Trump Tries To Throw Michelle Obama Under The Bus, Falls Flat On His Face Instead (VIDEO)","You would think that after President Barack Obama specifically warned Republican nominee Donald Trump not to attack his wife, Trump wouldn t want to test those waters. Then again, when has Trump ever listened to the advice of anyone other than himself?On Friday during a rally in North Carolina, Trump tried to slam First Lady Michelle Obama by taking a line out of a 2007 campaign speech to smear Michelle, President Barack Obama and his opponent Hillary Clinton. Trump tried to throw each of his biggest threats under the bus when he said:We have a bunch of babies running our country, a bunch of losers. They are babies. We have a president, all he wants to do is campaign. His wife, all she wants to do is campaign.I see how much his wife likes Hillary, but wasn t she the one that started the statement:  If you can t take care of your home, you can t take care of the White House or the country? Trump was quoting a line from Michelle s 2007 speech when she was campaigning for her husband   but he took it completely out of context. Michelle had been talking about how she managed politics, two careers and raising two children. This balancing act between family and work responsibilities is something that many Americans could relate to, which was why she said it. Her words were:One of the things, the important aspects of this race, is role modeling what good families should look like. And my view is that if you can t run your own house, you certainly can t run the White House. Can t do it. So, so we ve adjusted our schedules to make sure that our girls are first, so while he s traveling around, I do day trips. They just know that I was at home to tuck them in at night, and it keeps them grounded, and, and children, the children in our country have to know that they come first. And our girls do, and that s why we re doing this. We re in this race for not just our children, but all of our children. It was a beautiful speech, and it is simply disgusting that Trump would use it in such a negative context. However, it s a sure sign that the business mogul is still bitter about the speech Michelle gave on Thursday, where Michelle accurately stated that Trump could not relate to the average American s struggles. She said:Perhaps living life high up in a tower in a world of exclusive clubs, measuring success by wins and losses, the number of zeros in your bank account. Perhaps you just develop a different set of values. Maybe with so little exposure to people who are different than you, it becomes easy to take advantage of those who are down on their luck. To him, most of America is  them. So basically, the only way Trump can attack Michelle is by making things up and twisting her words   but he only makes himself look stupid in the end.

 Incompetent Trump WH Already F**king Up; Has To Adjust Their Muslim Ban (DETAILS),"Donald Trump is easily the most unprepared and incompetent person to ever be elected president. His most recent outrage of course is his immigration ban on those arriving in the United States from seven Muslim majority countries. That caused the nation and world to erupt in chaos, and people who were legal residents of the United States were turned away or deported   all because of their nations of origin. Now, realizing that they royally fucked up, Trump and his band of clowns are trying to hurriedly clean it up amid worldwide protests.On Sunday s edition of Meet the Press, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus decided that people who hold green cards and are perfectly safe and legal residents should be allowed to come home. He said to host Chuck Todd: If you re an American citizen travelling back and forth to Libya, you are likely to be subjected to further questioning when you come into an airport. There is discretionary authority that a custos and border patrol agent has when they suspect that someone is up to no good when they travel back and forth to Libya or Yemen. Make no mistake   this is the Muslim ban that Trump promised. The chaotic and dangerous happenings of Friday and Saturday are only the beginning. We could very well be headed for a repeat of what happened during the Holocaust, when The United States turned away boatloads of people who were fleeing Adolf Hitler s Nazi death camps. Most of those people went on to be brutally tortured and murdered   all because we were too protectionist and cold-hearted to help them flee for their lives.What Priebus said is nothing more than a smoke screen to make people think that what they are doing is for the good of the nation and its people. Make no mistake   it isn t. This is administration is nothing more than a coup, the first step in ushering in White Supremacy as an American value and matter of policy. The only saving grace is their gross incompetence, and their inability to hide what they are really doing from the public. In the meantime, we are all in terrible danger as a result of electing a completely unqualified madman as president. #RESIST.Featured image via G.

 Donald Trump Once Took Away A Sick Baby’s Medical Because Of A Family Feud,"It s undeniable that Donald Trump is a giant asshat. His entire campaign built upon the exploitation of American conservatives  racism, and faux populist rhetoric that is completely at odds with his economic policies that he has put forward. But Trump s asshattery isn t just reserved for people he can exploit for political gain.The New York Times recently ran an article that detailed the relationship between Trump and his brother Freddy. Trump s younger brother was an alcoholic who died at the age of 43. Freddy s alcoholism caused a major rift to form in the two brothers  relationship. One of the most scandalous revelations in the piece is that Trump once revoked medical benefits to his nephew s sick infant son. Trump had promised that he would pay for Fred III (Trump s nephew) child s medical care. But a feud over an inheritance dispute devolved, that changed all of that.The New York Times reports: Then came the unveiling of Fred Sr. s will, which Donald had helped draft. It divided the bulk of the inheritance, at least $20 million, among his children and their descendants,  other than my son Fred C. Trump Jr. Freddy s children sued, claiming that an earlier version of the will had entitled them to their father s share of the estate, but that Donald and his siblings had used  undue influence  over their grandfather, who had dementia, to cut them out.A week later, Mr. Trump retaliated by withdrawing the medical benefits critical to his nephew s infant child. Trump s family did not want to talk to the media about the matter. Trump offered the New York Times an explanation for his actions during an interview, saying,  I was angry because they sued.  Trump claims the whole thing was eventually settled  very amicably. Trump s villainy has officially reached daytime soap opera levels. For sure, much of Trump s hateful antics are a campaign tactic that he is using to get free media coverage.

STRANGER THAN FICTION: Why Is Foundation of Vegas Shooting Survivor Sponsored By DHS Linked Firm?,"Shawn Helton  21st Century WireWhen looking at the deeply entangled mystery surrounding the Las Vegas mass shooting, there s been no shortage of questionable details and information that just doesn t add up.You know the old adage, truth is often stranger than fiction   VEGAS QUESTIONS    Who is working behind the scenes concerning the High Desert Phoenix Foundation? (Photo illustration 21WIRE s Shawn Helton)The shooting involving the Las Vegas Mandalay Bay Resort and Route 91 Harvest Festival, has ushered in the brutal return of politicized mass tragedy in America. The dramatic nature of the surreal as of yet still motiveless crime, only adds to a traumatic event that is now being described as  the 9/11 of Mass Shootings. Similarly, over this past week, a story of concerning the sudden tragic death of a Las Vegas shooting survivor sent shock waves through both mainstream media and alternative media alike.As a chorus of gripping media reports detailed the unexpected death of 28 year-old Kymberley Jo (Synder) Suchomel (left photo Daily Press) in the days after the Las Vegas mass shooting, those still in search of answers in the aftermath of the tragedy were left captivated by her tale.By now, many may already be familiar with media accounts of Suchomel s harrowing tale of survival, who along with close friends, was said to have attended the Route 91 Harvest Festival the night of the Las Vegas shooting massacre.As the untimely circumstances of Suchomel s death have been conflated with the unexplained events in Las Vegas, many in alternative media have hastily assumed that the young fund raiser s death was somehow linked to her dispute of the Las Vegas mass shooting storyline via social media posts on a Facebook account associated with her. Subsequently, online interpretations of the Suchomel story have led to a digital firestorm on social media, producing a wave of speculation prior to a more complete analysis of the survivor s tale.Despite sensationalized reportage, at this time, there s no concrete evidence to prove a social media-based conspiracy concerning the death of Suchomel According to the original story first published by the Daily Press, we re told Suchomel died in her sleep as she was said to have suffered from epilepsy and had been  prone to seizures.  Additionally, Suchomel, who was reportedly taking medication for a pituitary tumor, was discovered dead by her grandmother Julie Norton at 8:30am on October 9th at her Apple Valley, California home. At this moment, an autopsy of Suchomel s death is still pending.QUESTION: Is it possible that  open source investigators  were being led into a virtual cul-de-sac and thus missing the real story?Media Tripwire?Undoubtedly, the uncanny timing of Suchomel s death has come on the heels of a brewing controversy over the Las Vegas mass shooting. This has led to increased speculation, turbo-charging even more spurious internet-based conspiracies and allegations. These now viral stories have simultaneously been published, as anonymous survivor claims from those close to Suchomel have presented Facebook messages associated with her account. Suchomel s claims also allude to multiple shooters involved in the Las Vegas shooting, as she allegedly planned to  organize a group of survivors, and that The media can suck it. They have no idea what went down! While Suchomel s story is compelling, you have to wonder   is there more than we ve been told?At face value, Suchomel s public account of the Las Vegas shooting is persuasive and does appear to question the official narrative. However, one should look at information from multiple angles in order to formulate a more full spectrum understanding of complex multilayered criminality.*UPDATE*   Below are two screen shots associated with a Linkedin profile under the name of Kymberley Suchomel. We at 21WIRE cannot verify if this profile is connected in anyway to the Las Vegas shooting survivor or not, but several similarities in the appearance of the individual, home location and the inclusion of an aero-space industry government contractor Aero-Zone, along with others, raises some serious questions The inclusion of the above Linkedin profile is not necessarily an endorsement of a larger conspiracy concerning the Suchomel saga. However, the Linkedin revelations above have surfaced at or around the same time as other government contractor links have been uncovered regarding the Las Vegas shooting survivor s charitable foundation. (see below)QUESTION:Is the Linkedin profile above a ruse, someone else   or another mysterious part of the Suchomel story?SEE ALSO: The Las Vegas Mass Shooting   More to the Story Than We ve Been ToldAlthough the police dispatch communication, along with eye-witness testimony reveals some startling information contradicting the official story surrounding the Las Vegas mass shooting, one must be cautious when looking at all of the available evidence of a suspicious crime   however difficult that may be.As larger outlets in alternative media such as Infowars have sensationalized this highly emotive aspect of the Las Vegas tragedy, a series of formulaic polarizing political points have become an echo chamber in its aftermath. This type of conjecture rapidly descends into wild speculation only serving to magnify emotionally driven elements of a particular story, something that could be used to deliberately steer public perception away from any potential forensic clues.It s important to remember that during same time SITE Intelligence injected an  ISIS meme  into the Las Vegas tragedy without revealing any solid evidence, Infowars quickly followed suit. This then prompted an apparent  official  statement that echoed those dubious claims from the terror group ISIS. Although these claims still linger, they ve failed to produce any real connection to ISIS.As we ve noted numerous times here at 21WIRE, the intelligence monitoring group called SITE, has ties to both the CIA and Israeli intelligence. The group has also had ethical concerns raised over the nature of their intel gathering in the last decade and according to the group s founder, Rita Katz they ve managed to release terror related material linked to ISIS prior to the group itself.  GEO GROUP    A private-for-profit corrections and detention firm formerly known as Wackenhut Corrections Corporation under the umbrella of The Wackenhut Corporation. (Image Source corporatewatch)Strange Bedfellows: Follow the MoneyWhat you re about to see below, is a collection of material revealing what appears to be a rather incredible financial component connected to the High Desert Phoenix Foundation, a charitable organization co-founded by the recently deceased Las Vegas mass shooting survivor Kymberley Suchomel. The High Desert Phoenix Foundation claims to have raised funds for grieving families affected by trauma since 2008. This amazing coincidence, rather incredibly, has not been mentioned once in any of the conspiratorial claims surrounding the Suchomel story at alternative media outlets. Put another way, a survivor of a traumatic event has been a long time co-founder of a foundation that contends to have helped those who have endured a traumatic tragedy themselves. It s a difficult question to ask    but what are the chances of this uncanny coincidence?Furthermore, new evidence uncovers details concerning the High Desert Phoenix Foundation s high-profile sponsors, one that includes the The GEO Group, Inc (GEO). This long time financial donor, is also linked to well-known government contractor security firms. Is this also a coincidence?In recent years, controversy has enveloped the multi-billion-dollar corporation known as Geo Group. Critics of GEO Group contend that politically motivated contributions have led to an expansion of its for-profit prisons system through federal, state and government contractual agreements at the expense of public safety. Even more concerning, is that critics argue that GEO Group has fostered a dangerous work environment via it s under staffed operations, inadequate training and apparent mistreatment of detainees and other inmates. This has led to a potentially volatile situation for communities nearby GEO Group s facilities. QUESTION: Does this sound like a suitable donor for a charitable foundation known for helping grieving families?In 1984, Wackenhut Corrections Corporation (WCC) had been formed as a part of The Wackenhut Corporation. In 2003, WCC management bought up all stock held by its subsidiary G4S, altering its name to The GEO Group, Inc.In 2004, other divisions of the Wackenhut Corporation were purchased by Group 4 Falck, a security focused subsidiary known as G4S Wackenhut, was later renamed again as G4S Secure Solutions.Here s a screen shot of the High Desert Phoenix Foundation s mission statement. Notice the modest look of the website   an organization with the financial backing of the multi-billion dollar GEO Group, one of the nation s largest for-profit prison operators The reason why the GEO Group link is so significant, is that prior to modern America s largest mass shooting in Las Vegas, an apparent survivor of the incident was operating a foundation that was accepting financial support from a large-scale company formerly known as The Wackenhut Corporation, a subsidiary of G4S Secure Solutions, one of the world s largest security firms, and a Department of Homeland Security connected conglomerate tied to the suspicious Orlando shooting in the summer of 2016   an event, that was previously the country s largest mass shooting. If you remember, 29-year old Omar Mateen, an Afghani-American was located in Port St. Lucie, Florida, about 120 miles outside of Orlando. In 2013, Mateen was placed under a terror watch list for 10 months (interviewed two to three times by the FBI 2013-14) and had worked for G4S Secure Solutions, headquartered in Jupiter, Florida, a company which was formerly part of a CIA-linked government contractor and security firm known as The Wackenhut Corporation.G4S, as it turns out, was the very first  designated  and certified Department of Homeland Security (DHS) contractor and recently secured a $234 million dollar contract with the federal cabinet department. In addition to apparently providing security solutions for  90 percent of U.S. nuclear facilities,  G4S, according to border patrol sources has also been tasked with the transportation and release of illegal immigrants inside the interior of the United States. At least one of Mateen s roles with G4S, was to transport and provide security for prisoner youths in Florida.Here s a screen shot from the High Desert Phoenix Foundation s website that proudly displays their billion dollar government contract linked  diamond  donor, The Geo Group Below is a link to the first discussion about the Geo Group connection as it relates to the Las Vegas mass shooting Boiler Room: Stranger than Fiction   New Anomalies in the Las Vegas Mass Shooting with Shawn Helton & HesherSEE ALSO: The Las Vegas and Weinstein Cover-ups: Boiler Room EP #132The amount of independent examination regarding the Las Vegas shooting case thus far is fairly staggering and in the wake of any multilayered event, one must proceed with caution when reviewing the available evidence, as the doorway for a  trial by media  frenzy in both mainstream media and alternative media could be used to derail sincere analysis.What should the public make of the the High Desert Phoenix Foundation s long time financial links to a high-profile government contractor?All of this comes, as the Las Vegas shooting star witness, Mandalay Bay security guard Jesus Campos resurfaced to appear in what the public has been told will be his only media appearance to discuss this bizarre and highly questionable case.It s also worth mentioning that Campos failed to shed any more light on the shifting timeline of events associated with the Las Vegas mass shooting.

He s desperately trying to find a Joseph Goebbels communications director and he s having no luck whatsoever finding someone to peddle his lies.Trump s Chief of Staff, Reince Priebus is temporarily filling the position of communications director, and frankly, with Steve Bannon doing the job of shadow government chief of staff, he probably has the time, but still, Trump, like the people who held that office before him, needs to find his person and so far, at least two have turned him down flat. There is a list of candidates, but I can see why people aren t interested. It s a tough job,  said a senior administration official.Those difficulties are compounded by Trump s management style: The president is known to pit his senior aides against each other, creating rivalries and divisions among his staff that have already impacted the rollout of a major policy initiative. Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller, the president s chief strategist and senior adviser, managed to keep the president s executive order on immigration so closely held that it not only erroneously banned green-card holders from entering the country, but also left members of the Cabinet   responsible for defending the policy   scrambling to respond.Source: PoliticoNot to mention the fact that most of the communications to come out of the current White House are either completely unethical or completely untrue. That s not exactly something that most people feel comfortable adding to their CV.For Democrats and for sane Americans, this is a small sign but it s a significant one. Trump loves to compare the country to a business and well, if we re going with that comparison, Trump is the Ford Pinto of politics. If a person gets too close, their career goes up in flames. As people in Washington are distancing themselves from the toxic orange man, you ll begin to see Republicans in Congress do the same. It s already happening with Trump s Supreme Court nominee.Read more:Featured image via Pool/Getty Images",News,"February 9, 2017",2194
 CNN Host Abruptly Ends Segment After Fox Sports Guest Makes DISGUSTING Trump-like Comment (VIDEO),"One thing that most conservatives have in common with Donald Trump   and perhaps contributes to the reason they relate to him and supported him for POTUS   is chronic misogyny and sexism. We saw this play out on Friday during a panel discussion on CNN, when an anchor had to shut the segment down abruptly due to a highly inappropriate comment from her Fox guest.CNN s Brooke Baldwin had Fox Sports Radio host Clay Travis as a guest, and the exchange went downhill very quickly. The panel was addressing the incident in which ESPN s Jemele Hill had called Trump a white supremacist, causing the White House to demand her be fired. When Clay Travis had his turn to give his opinion on the matter, he made Baldwin wish she d never asked him. Travis said this: I believe in the First Amendment and boobs. Baldwin was practically speechless, and had to do a double take, asking him if he d actually just said the word  boobs.  Travis only made it worse: Boobs, two things that never let me down, the first amendment and boobs. Those are the two things I believe in absolutely in the country. Baldwin still couldn t believe her ears, and wanted to give Travis another chance and the benefit of the doubt. She asked him once more to clarify that he d said  boobs  instead of  booze.  Once she confirmed that Travis had definitely said  boobs,  she shut the interview down right then and there. She said: I m done, I m sorry. I m done. This conversation is over, yanking mikes, bye. Forgive me, live television happens and you think you heard something, you are not sure and then you realize it happened, so I apologize for him on that. Right after the segment, Baldwin and Travis were both seen on Twitter, reacting to what had happened in two totally different ways. Baldwin seemed horrified and shocked, and Travis was, of course, proud of himself.What Travis said is not okay, and must be condemned. We re not at all surprised that this would come from a Fox employee, considering how prevalent misogyny, sexual assault, and support for our sexist POTUS is.Featured image via video screen capture ",News,"September 15, 2017",2094

OBAMA AND VALERIE JARRETT Finalize Executive Action Gun Control Proposal,"It s almost as though we don t even have a Constitution Never let a crisis go to waste President Barack Obama s advisers are finalizing a proposal that would expand background checks on gun sales without congressional approval.White House adviser Valerie Jarrett says the president has asked his team to complete a proposal and submit it for his review  in short order.  She says the recommendations will include measures to expand background checks.Jarrett spoke Wednesday night at a vigil for the victims of the Newtown shooting, according to a summary provided by the White House.After the mass shooting in Roseburg, Oregon, Obama said his team was looking for ways to tighten gun laws without a vote in Congress. White House officials have said they re exploring closing the so-called  gun show loophole  that anti-gun advocates claim allows people to buy weapons at gun shows and online without a background check.The move comes following the deadly terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California, that left 14 people dead. All of the guns used in the massacre were purchased legally. Opponents of new gun control regulations have argued that the proposals being pushed by Obama would not have prevented the tragedy or recent mass shootings.

THINGS GET UGLY When White Guy Tries Social Experiment In Wrong Neighborhood: Asks People What They Think Of “All Lives Matter” Sign [VIDEO],"In this video White people are asked how they feel about the  Black Lives Matter  sign. While they may not agree with its sentiment for whatever reason, they walk away and choose not to engage the sign holder, allowing him his right to freedom of speech. They may not agree, but they respect that he is within his rights to hold the sign or even to question them about it. When Blacks are confronted with an  All Lives Matter  sign, their reaction becomes violent. They attempt to threaten the white guy with the sign. One guy was even nice enough to warn him that holding a sign that says,  White Lives Matter  might cause people passing by to harm him.This little social experiment tells us more than just how people feel about those words. It shows us how people on the Left are not only willing to openly shut down free speech in America, but they threaten you with violence if you don t conform to their beliefs. This is a real problem today. Obama has silently condoned the use of physical violence to threaten someone who doesn t agree with you. He has made it clear by his unwillingness to condemn the violence that you need to take whatever steps necessary to shut down the opposition to your cause, and that the end always justifies the means.Watch:",left-news,"Sep 27, 2016",1259

Believe me, it s true, it is true,  added Turnbull, alluding to the Russian scandal playing out in the White House.In the wake of the backlash from the leaked video, Turnbull told Melbourne Talk Radio that his mockery was a light-hearted jest and a  good-humored roast.  He thinks people should  lighten up  about it.You can pretty much guarantee Trump won t be  lightening up  about this genius comedy act making fun of him in the best way possible.

 Lindsey Graham Sends A Final ‘F*** You’ To Trump As He Announces Who He Voted For (TWEETS),"This election has been hard for South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham. After fighting his little Republican heart out in the primaries only to see a reality TV star defeat him and every other more qualified GOPer, Graham continued to be devastated long after Trump became the Republican nominee.Graham s journey through Trump s campaign has been nothing short of an emotional roller coaster, starting with him trashing The Donald and refusing to keep his promise to support the party s nominee regardless of who it was. Then, Graham eventually decided to support Trump after much hesitance, only to completely disown him in the end after one too many offensive statements and erratic stunts. Needless to say, Graham is probably one of the most relieved people in the GOP that this election has finally come to an end.On Tuesday, Graham decided to celebrate Election Day with one more final  F*ck You  to Trump, someone that Graham clearly doesn t think deserves to be anywhere near the White House. Using his hatred for Trump as the inspiration behind his voting choice, Graham announced who he actually voted for on Twitter, and it s going to break Trump s little black heart:TwitterTwitterTwitterGraham decided that since he can t stand the thought of voting for Trump but didn t want to vote for Hillary Clinton, either, that he would just vote for the next best thing in his mind   Evan McMullin, who came into the election late with the simple goal of being an alternative to Trump.Graham is the very first senator to publicly say that he s voting for the conservative independent candidate, and it s a huge slap in the face to Trump. We expect that many more disgruntled Republicans will be making similar choices, although many may not have the courage to actually admit it.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla and Alex Wong / Getty Images",News,"November 9, 2016",1845

Could this charade of an investigation into Trump-Russian collusion get any more embarrassing for special counsel Robert Mueller?A supervisory special agent who is now under scrutiny after being removed from Robert Mueller s Special Counsel s Office for alleged bias against President Trump also oversaw the bureau s interviews of embattled former National Security advisor Michael Flynn, this reporter has learned. Flynn recently pled guilty to one-count of lying to the FBI last week.FBI agent Peter Strzok was one of two FBI agents who interviewed Flynn, which took place on Jan. 24, at the White House, said several sources. The other FBI special agent, who interviewed Flynn, is described by sources as a field supervisor in the  Russian Squad, at the FBI s Washington Field Office,  according to a former intelligence official, with knowledge of the interview.Strzok was removed from his role in the Special Counsel s Office after it was discovered he had made disparaging comments about President Trump in text messages between him and his alleged lover FBI attorney Lisa Page, according to the New York Times and Washington Post, which first reported the stories. Strzok is also under investigation by the Department of Justice Inspector General for his role in Hillary Clinton s email server and the ongoing investigation into Russia s election meddling. On Saturday, the House Intelligence Committee s Chairman Devin Nunes chided the Justice Department and the FBI for not disclosing why Strzok had been removed from the Special Counsel three months ago, according to a statement given by the Chairman.The former U.S. intelligence official told this reporter,  with the recent revelation that Strzok was removed from the Special Counsel investigation for making anti-Trump text messages it seems likely that the accuracy and veracity of the 302 of Flynn s interview as a whole should be reviewed and called into question. The most logical thing to happen would be to call the other FBI Special Agent present during Flynn s interview before the Grand Jury to recount his version,  the former intelligence official added.The former official also said that  Strzok s allegiance to (Deputy Director Andrew) McCabe was unwavering and very well known. Flynn, a retired three-star general, issued a statement on Dec. 1, saying,  it has been extraordinarily painful to endure these many months of false accusations of  treason  and other outrageous acts. Such false accusations are contrary to everything I have ever done and stood for. But I recognize that the actions I acknowledged in court today were wrong, and, through my faith in God, I am working to set things right. According to another source, with direct knowledge of the Jan. 24 interview, McCabe had contacted Flynn by phone directly at the White House. White House officials had spent the  earlier part of the week with the FBI overseeing training and security measures associated with their new roles so it was no surprise to Flynn that McCabe had called,  the source said.McCabe told Flynn  some agents were heading over (to the White House) but Flynn thought it was part of the routine work the FBI had been doing and said they would be cleared at the gate,  the source said. It wasn t until after they were already in (Flynn s) office that he realized he was being formerly interviewed. He didn t have an attorney with him,  they added.Flynn s attorney Robert Kelner did not respond for comment.A former FBI agent said the investigation into Strzok and the reported text messages between him and Page, shows a  bias that cannot be ignored particularly if he had anything to do with Flynn s interview and his role in it. The former U.S. intelligence official questioned,  how logical is it that Flynn is being charged for lying to an agent whose character and neutrality was called into question by the Special Counsel. According to an anonymous source in The Washington Post, Strzok s and Page had exchanged a number of texts that  expressed anti-Trump sentiments and other comments that appeared to favor Clinton.

 Sean Spicer Dreams Up Brand-New Fake Terrorist Attack To Defend Trump’s Muslim Ban,"As if we didn t already have enough proof that Trump s administration is full of pathological, compulsive liars, along comes Sean Spicer with yet more. It s not his defense of Kellyanne Conway s mysteriously non-existent terror attack at Bowling Green that lands him on the growing mountain of lies. Rather, it s that he himself has referenced an imaginary terror attack multiple times.CNN put together a short list of Spicer s references to a terror attack in Atlanta that never happened:The first timeHere s what Spicer told ABC s  This Week  on January 29 while defending the President s travel ban: What do we say to the family who loses somebody over a terroristic (sic)   to whether it s Atlanta or San Bernardino or the Boston bomber? Those people, each of whom had gone out to a country and then come back,  Spicer said.The second timeThe next day, Spicer appeared on MSNBC s  Morning Joe  and also mentioned Atlanta while defending the travel ban: There was a very short period of time in which we had something to execute that ensured that the people of the United States were safe. Everybody s been protected,  Spicer said.  What happened if we didn t act and somebody was killed?   Too many of these cases that have happened   whether you re talking about San Bernardino, Atlanta   Boston   would you wait until you do? The answer is we act now to protect the future. The third timeAnd in his January 30 press briefing, Spicer once again alluded to an Atlanta terror attack. When asked by a reporter why some countries linked to terrorism aren t on the travel ban list, Spicer responded: Right, and we re reviewing the entire process over this period of time to make sure that we do this right. But I don t think you have to look any further than the families of the Boston Marathon, in Atlanta, in San Bernardino to ask if we can go further. CNN has been unable to reach Spicer for comment, but some speculate that he might actually be referring to Orlando. The only problem is, he keeps saying Atlanta and it s not like the Orlando massacre was a small, minor incident where such a misstep might be understandable. The last known terror attacks in Atlanta were at the 1996 Olympics, and at a lesbian club in 1997. Both happened at the hands of a right-wing American terrorist.In other words, they weren t attacks by radical Muslims. And there have been no other acts of terrorism in Atlanta. Yet here s Spicer, saying  Atlanta  over and over again to defend Trump s Muslim ban.The Orlando attack, by contrast, was a massacre, and it s not like nobody can remember it. Odd mistake to make, if that s what s even happening.Maybe he s talking about tighter security in Atlanta following last year s terror attack in Brussels? That s not especially likely, either. When he finally gets a story together, he ll talk to the press. Or he ll ignore anything that has to do with his references to Atlanta. But, like Kellyanne Conway, he said it, and then repeated it. It s hard to believe that s just a misspoken word.Read more:Featured image by Mark Wilson via Getty Images",News,"February 8, 2017",3079
"Trump ‘Diversity Council’ Member Threatens to Quit If Trump Ends DACA…Bye, Bye!

Bye Bye!Trump diversity council member tells @Acosta he may quit the council if Trump moves ahead to end DACA https://t.co/CCn90EgSdn  CNN Newsroom (@CNNnewsroom) September 4, 2017 I want to remind him and his team that from an economic standpoint, and again, we re business people if you look at this from a purely economic standpoint again, none of these young people gets government benefits of any sorts so they re not costing us anything. They pay over $2 billion in taxes Is anyone else out there sick of the American people being told illegals cost nothing?DACA Will Cost Americans And Their Government A Huge Amount of Money.On average, people with college degrees pay more in taxes than they receive in government benefits. People without a degree consume more taxes than they pay to federal, state and local tax officials.In 2013, a Heritage Foundation study showed that amnesty for 11 million illegals would spike federal spending by $6,300 billion over the next five decades. That is roughly equivalent to $550,000 per illegal, or $10,000 per illegal per year, much of which will be spent when the immigrant becomes eligible for Social Security and Medicare. That cost estimate does not include the extra costs created when immigrants use their new legal powers as a citizen to bring in more low-skilled migrants.If those 3 million DACA people and their parents soon become legal residents or citizens, then Obama s DACA will cost Americans roughly $1,700 billion over the next 50 years, according to Heritage Foundation s numbers.Moreover, the DACA migrants add to the flood of illegal labor that has driven down wages for ordinary Americans, including urban youths and recent immigrants. Currently, Americans lose roughly $500 billion a year from their salaries because of the immigration tax caused by cheap labor according to the academies  report.Via: GP",left-news,"Sep 4, 2017",1992

“TRAITOR IN CHIEF” WARNS CONGRESS…Shut Down Prison With Muslim Terrorists Or I’ll Stop Funding Military [VIDEO],"Name one time this reckless  Commander in Chief  has put our men and women in uniform before the war on terror Just one.On Monday, the Obama administration announced that President Obama would veto a defense authorization bill if it did not close down Guantanamo Bay. White House press secretary Josh Earnest explained that the House funding bill would be vetoed  principally because of the irresponsible way that it funds our national defense priorities, but also because of the efforts to prevent the closure [of] the prison at Guantanamo Bay.  He added that Democrats would sustain Obama s veto, and defense authorization would die.Obama s strong stand on Gitmo underscores two vital points. First, President Obama does not fear defunding America s national security. Second, Obama does not fear Republicans in Congress.The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) has been authorized for five decades running. The current NDAA fully funds the military through a workaround measure, thanks to President Obama s demands that a huge chunk of sequestration cuts come from defense funding. Now Democrats complain that the workaround measure isn t good enough: Republicans should bust open the bank again.But that s not Obama s main criticism of the NDAA. He has long had a bug in his ear with regard to Gitmo, which he feels has strengthened terrorists  feelings about the evils of the United States. Given his recent moves to parlay with the Cuban dictatorship as well, Obama may want to hand Gitmo in totality back to the Cuban government. The fact that Obama would be willing to dramatically cut America s military funding, even as Russia takes over Ukraine and Syria, as Iran gears up for a big regional military push, as China continues its aggressive behavior in the South China Sea, demonstrates Obama s top priority is doing leftist work, not protecting the United States.In fact, Obama s choice to prioritize Gitmo above national security isn t a choice at all: Obama wants America s military slashed, and he wants Gitmo closed. Senator Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) agrees with Obama that Gitmo should be closed, but even he says that Obama has manipulated the process to create an impasse. According to Roll Call, McCain  has said the White House promised him a plan to close the prison, but has yet to present one. Without that, he has said he wouldn t be able to find the votes to do what the White House wants. Now, normally, Obama s nasty priorities would pose little threat to military funding: after all, Obama would be stymied by Republicans in Congress. And Obama has threatened to veto the NDAA before over Guantanamo; each time, Congress has called Obama s bluff, and he has signed the bill into law.But this time, the feeling is that Obama could be more serious. After all, with the legacy of Republicans folding on executive amnesty, the Iran deal, and funding for Planned Parenthood, among others, Obama probably feels he can leverage Gitmo out of existence. He believes that Republicans fear defense defunding more than he must   their constituents will hold them accountable, while he s in pure  f*** it list  mode. He also thinks that Republicans are unwilling to undergo a head-to-head matchup with him under almost any circumstances.And Obama is right. In his entire tenure as Commander-in-Chief, Obama has had to issue a grand total of four vetoes. Four. That s less than every president since Chester A. Arthur, who filled out James Garfield s term, serving less than four years. Obama has had a fully Republican Congress this year, and a Republican House since 2010. He has issued just two vetoes this year, one with regard to Keystone XL Pipeline, and the other with regard to a bill related to the National Labor Relations Board. All of his other major policy priorities have been guarded zealously by a Democratic minority or an unwilling Republican majority.So why wouldn t Obama try to hold Republicans  feet to the fire on defense authorization?Obama s mastery of Congress is unprecedented in American history; the only other candidates for that title either held Congressional dominance within their own party (Franklin Delano Roosevelt) or ruled a Congressional rump (Abraham Lincoln). Shutting down America s defense funding would be a crowning achievement for a president who cares more about weakening America s role in the world than defending her citizens.Via: Breitbart News",politics,"Oct 8, 2015",4414
 WATCH: President Obama HAMMERS Trump For Claiming Black People Are Worse Off Today,"Donald Trump thinks African-Americans are worse off now than they have ever been, and President Obama just took him to the woodshed for it.During a rally, Trump declared that  African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape than they ve ever been in before. The assertion suggests that slavery was a picnic for black people and that Jim Crow was heaven on earth.But President Obama set Trump straight during an interview with Good Morning America at the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture. You know, I think even most 8-year-olds ll tell you that whole slavery thing wasn t very good for black people,  Obama told Robin Roberts.  Jim Crow wasn t very good for black people. What we have to do is use our history to propel us to make more progress in the future. Here s the video via ABC.President Obama also slammed those who think racism no longer exists in this country simply because he was elected to the presidency or because some black people make a lot of money. It s unrealistic to think that somehow that all just completely went away, because the Civil Rights Act was passed or because Oprah s making a lot of money or because I was elected president. You know, that s not how society works. And if you have hundreds of years of racial discrimination it s likely that the vestiges of that discrimination linger on. And we should acknowledge that and own that. As President Obama said, Donald Trump could learn a lot from a visit to this museum. To think that black people had it easy as slaves is offensive and it s almost as if Trump thinks they would be better off going back to being slaves. So he s definitely on a slippery slope, and while that may get his white supremacist supporters frothing at the mouth, it does nothing to help him get black people to vote for him.Featured Image: Jim Lo Scalzo-Pool/Getty Images",News,"September 23, 2016",1880

Judicial Watch s release this week of 725 pages of State Department emails involving Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin demonstrates the Obama administration considers a large percentage of the emails sent through Clinton s private server too sensitive for Congress or the American public to read.Of the 725 pages, more than 250 pages were 100 percent redacted, many with  PAGE DENIED  stamped in bold.Judicial Watch said the new cache includes previously unreleased email exchanges in which former Abedin  provided influential Clinton Foundation donors special, expedited access to the secretary of state. Judicial Watch added that in many instances, the preferential treatment provided to donors was at the specific request of Clinton Foundation executive Douglas Band. The Abedin emails reveal that the longtime Clinton aide apparently served as a conduit between Clinton Foundation donors and Hillary Clinton while Clinton served as secretary of state. In more than a dozen email exchanges, Abedin provided expedited, direct access to Clinton for donors who had contributed from $25,000 to $10 million to the Clinton Foundation,  Judicial Watch said in a statement announcing the release.

WOW! WOMAN TOTALLY FREAKS OUT At Sight Of Confederate Flag In Store…REAL OR FAKE OUTRAGE? [Video],"WHAT NOT TO DO IS PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING THIS NUTJOB DID:1. Do not angrily confront anyone with children in tow Franklin claims to be terrified of these men and yet she aggressively confronts them and films them while hurling insults at them. She thinks they are  racists  and people who support  hate symbols,  which leads one to believe she also thinks they are capable of great violence. Would you provoke violent racists while you have your children with you? I wouldn t. So either she s incredibly stupid or she knows these men aren t dangerous at all and what she is doing is meant to intimidate and shame them. (Let s also acknowledge that it can t possibly be good for children to hear their mother sobbing and freaking out while she does absolutely nothing to reassure them. It s hard to watch.)2. Don t lie about things that are verifiably untrue When faking a hate hoax, make sure you edit out the parts of the video that prove you re a liar. She lied about several things. First, she lied about the Confederate flags  hanging on the wall.  You ll notice that in the video you can t see any flags. That s because there weren t any on the wall like Franklin claimed. She might have gotten away with it if she hadn t taken a picture of the flags and posted them on her Facebook page for anyone to see. Here is the  flag  she claims was displayed on the wall: It it not a flag and it is not hanging on the wall. It s a rug that is hanging in a rug rack with other rugs and it s buried in the middle where she would have had to dig through them to find it. Then she lied about what the men said to her. We can clearly hear the man call her a  bit*h.  But when she describes what happens to her to a bystander, she decides to make it sound worse by saying he called her a  f***ing bit*h.  She also adds that they followed her around, which also doesn t appear true when watching the video she made.Then she lies about the man in the parking lot  approaching  her! Clearly, the man is filming her from about 50 feet away while standing absolutely still. He only moves once when she dares him not to come any closer and sarcastically takes one giant step forward like he s playing Simon Says. It s hilarious. This triggers the next mentally unstable reaction from the SJW.3. If you can t muster real tears, don t bother Her out-of-control response and fake crying are Razzie-worthy. She s so  terrified  and scared for her life that she remembers to turn the camera around so we can all see her dry cheeks as she wails uncontrollably at an ear-splitting frequency. Then, when a good Samaritan comes over to assist her, she continues her bad acting and fake sobbing while her nose grows on camera as she starts recounting a bunch of stuff that didn t happen, proving once again that SJWs always lie.Via: PJMedia",Government News,"May 15, 2017",2814
 Watch Paul Ryan Try – And Fail – To Hold In A Laugh During One Of Obama’s Jokes (VIDEO),"During last night s State of the Union, Republican politicians attempted to put on a brave face and avoid showing any sort of approval for a single thing that President Obama said. Some succeeded better than others.Speaker of the House Paul Ryan had the toughest job. Sitting directly behind the president, the camera was directly on his face throughout most of the speech. America cringed as Ryan desperately tried to keep his face emotionless and dead while Obama spoke. For the most part, the effect was to make Ryan seem nearly comatose. His dead eyes barely moved. His slackjawed expression radiated defiant stupidity. It was really hard to watch.The farce was blown apart, however, when Obama landed a particularly great zinger and Ryan couldn t help but break into a laugh. Knowing that even flashing a brief smile could send his fanatical Republican colleagues into a blood-thirsty rage, Ryan did everything in his power to stop himself from laughing. His face did things I didn t know a face could do. On live television, Ryan s face went to war with itself.Here s Paul Ryan trying reeeeally hard not to laugh at one of Obama s jokes pic.twitter.com/gqekuYJ1BF  GQ Magazine (@GQMagazine) January 13, 2016At one point, Ryan appears to physically put his tongue in cheek in order to keep it from betraying its Republican values.But if Republicans were trying   and failing   to put on a brave face, President Obama was clearly enjoying himself. In his final State of the Union address he took time to go over the many successes his administration had been able to achieve. He also used the opportunity to blast Republicans for the childish games they continue to play in order to score cheap political points at the expense of real governance.It s unclear whether Obama had known ahead of time that Republicans would be obsessively focusing on not smiling throughout his speech or if he just guessed based on past behavior, but Paul Ryan s idiotic attempts to avoid giving Obama any sort of credit perfectly accented the president s point. Need an example of how delusional the GOP has gotten? The Republican Party, which once claimed to be the party of ideas, couldn t even applaud when the sitting president of the United States said  America is the most powerful nation on Earth.  Even agreeing with him on that point would be  controversial  for these partisan hacks.Thank you, Paul Ryan. Your weird facial expressions can be used whenever America needs a reminder of where your party s priorities really are. And we ll try not to laugh.Watch the full State of the Union address below (Ryan s failed attempt to stifle his laugh begins almost immediately):[youtube https://youtu.be/j4Qp7DxYWYY?t=57m21s]Feature image via C-SPAN",News,"January 13, 2016",2737
OUTRAGE! HOW REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT Is Using United States As Dumping Ground To Settle Diplomatic Disputes," Admitting Somalis who d been settled for years in Pakistan   like the Ohio State jihadi and his family   is only one of them. Another  refugee  absurdity was revealed recently   the Obama administration has agreed to admit illegal aliens intercepted at sea by Australia and held in camps outside that country, on two Pacific islands.The number of people said to be affected is reported to range from 1,600 to nearly 2,500; my colleague Nayla Rush has an overview here. These are people Australia has decided do not warrant refugee status (or what our law would consider asylum). Therefore they have no right to move to Australia. But for a variety of reasons, Australia cannot, or does not want to, send them back, and the  refugees  won t accept offers of resettlement in New Guinea or Cambodia because they re holding out for a First World country. What s more, their presence in those Australian-run camps on the islands of Nauru and Manus (the latter owned by Papua New Guinea) has become a political headache. Most are from Iran, with smaller numbers from Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, and elsewhere.I can see why Australia would want this deal; it costs Oz taxpayers $2 billion to run the two island detention facilities and closing them down would rid the government of the headache. But if Australia doesn t consider them refugees, why should we take them?It appears we re doing this as a favor to Australia; some speculate it s a quid pro quo for Australia s taking some U.S.-bound illegals in camps in Costa Rica, though how that s comparable isn t clear, and Australia has denied any such bargain. The chairman of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, Bob Goodlatte and Chuck Grassley, also want to know why we re doing this, and they wrote to the secretaries of State and Homeland Security asking for details on the secret agreement to bring the illegal aliens here. When Capitol Hill staffers asked the State Department how many such  refugees  would be resettled here under the secret deal, they were told the number was  classified.

 WATCH: CNN Host HUMILIATES Trump Supporter For Providing Laughable ‘Evidence’ Of Nationwide Voter Fraud,"One of Trump s biggest supporters just got their ass handed to them for having zero evidence of voter fraud.Donald Trump s lies about voter fraud imploded on Monday as CNN tore apart Kris Kobach, the man Stephen Miller cited when asked if he had evidence to prove Trump s claims.Miller repeatedly claimed that millions of Americans voted illegally in November to explain how Trump lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton. Miller specifically talked about New Hampshire, claiming that thousands of people from Massachusetts bused in to vote a second time in that state. Go to New Hampshire,  Miller said.  Talk to anybody who s worked in politics there for a long time. Everybody s aware of the problem in New Hampshire. Except that many former and current New Hampshire politicians from both parties have criticized Trump s claim.And when ABC host George Stephanopoulos asked Miller for evidence, he merely referred the media to Kansas Secretary of State and Trump supporter Kris Kobach.On Monday, CNN host Kate Bolduan confronted Kobach about Miller s claims. Miller says, look to you, sir, for the evidence,  Bolduan said.  Where is it? On election day 2016, 6,000 people registered in New Hampshire using an out-of-state driver s license,  Kobach claimed in response.  Of those over 6,000, just under 3,000   so just under half   used a Massachusetts driver s license. Now, some of those are going to be legit. They re going to be people who just moved to New Hampshire  but many of those will be out-of-state residents who voted in the state. What Kobach just said is a mere prediction. In a courtroom, it would be called conjecture because Kobach is making an opinion based on incomplete information. You truly do believe that thousands of people came in from Massachusetts to vote in New Hampshire on election day?  Bolduan continued in disbelief. We will have data at the end of the month [about] how many of those 6,000 people voted in both New Hampshire and in one of the other states,  Kobach said, admitting that he actually doesn t have evidence. He is only promising that he will have evidence at a later time, probably when whatever right-wing organization he is associated with provides their fabricated statistics.With no real evidence to support his claims, Bolduan pounced and slammed Kobach with reality. Mr. Secretary, wait a second. Stephen Miller, over the weekend, said thousands did vote illegally. Definitively saying that this actually happened. You re saying that there s going to be more data coming at the end of the month. So, do you have the evidence? Voter registration does not equal fraudulent votes. Kobach claimed that 3 million Americans are registered to vote in two states, which isn t illegal. Of course, Trump adviser Steve Bannon is also registered to vote in two states.Kobach then offered  proof  of Trump s claim by whining about CNN not covering the nine cases of voter fraud Kansas is prosecuting. Bolduan easily picked that  evidence  apart. You have nine cases,  Bolduan said.  Six guilty pleas, one dismissed, two pending. That s as of January 25th. Nine cases does not rampant widespread voter fraud make. A small minority does not make millions and millions of widespread, rampant votes in this country,  Bolduan continued.  What Stephen Miller and the president said over the weekend is this is exactly why they lost in New Hampshire. Not saying they were prospective cases, they were illegal votes. At that point, Kobach stumbled his way through the remainder of the interview as Bolduan countered his bullshit with facts at every turn.Here s the full smack down via YouTube.Donald Trump s voter fraud claims are a pathetic attempt to stroke his own ego because he can t handle the fact that he lost to a woman and is not a legitimate president. If he is really so concerned about voter fraud, he should call for a new election immediately. But he won t because he is full of shit.Featured image via screenshot",News,"February 13, 2017",3965
OBAMA’S Defense Deputy ACCIDENTALLY ADMITS Obama White House Spied On Candidate Trump During MSNBC Interview…But WAIT…There’s Even MORE To This Story! [VIDEO],"Accidents are bound to happen when Democrats become so comfortable with their allies in the liberal media that they forget they re on TV, as they expose themselves and their crooked administration to a national audience.The Conservative Treehouse does a brilliant job of dissecting the interview between former Obama administration official Evelyn Farkas and MSNBC s Mika Brzezinski. They also offer evidence of a fake disinformation campaign that was spread by the Obama regime about a Trump- Russian connection. [UPDATE to story below]This is stunningly interesting and hopefully will be picked up by MSM and congressional investigators.Sometimes when a person is deep inside an echo-chamber of like-minded ideologues, they might not realize what they re saying is rather revealing to those on the outside. That s the set up for former Obama administration official Evelyn Farkas (Deputy Asst. Secretary of Defense) appearing on MSNBC and admitting first hand knowledge the Obama administration spied on candidate and president-elect Donald Trump s transition team to gather  intelligence  for political use.It would appear Ms. Farkas was so caught up in the discussion, she didn t quite realize the significant admissions she was making about the Obama administration spying on Donald Trump s team and generating classified intelligence for Ms. Farkas (and others) to spread to Capitol Hill politicians. MSNBC s Mika Brzezinski recognized the  oh-snap  admission and tried to play it off,  but by then it was too late.With the help of MSNBC, simultaneous to her admission of first-hand specific knowledge of the administration spying on Mr. Trump, Ms. Evelyn Farkas outs herself as the key source for a New York Times report which discussed President Obama officials leaking classified information to media.Considerable irony jumps to the forefront when you recognize, the New York Times tried to protect Evelyn Farkas as the source of their reporting by stating: More than a half-dozen current and former officials described various aspects of the effort to preserve and distribute the intelligence, and some said they were speaking to draw attention to the material and ensure proper investigation by Congress. All spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were discussing classified information, nearly all of which remains secret.  (link)D oh.Whoopsie.Looks like Devin Nunes and the House Intelligence Committee has a new person to bring in for testimony. A positive development because at this rate the media leakers will out themselves without much need for investigation.I wonder what the criminal penalties are for having access to intelligence and sharing it with Democrat politicians [ The Hill People ].Question #1:Who, specifically, are these  Hill People  you speak of Mrs. Farkas?Watch again. Longer version starts at the 4:50 mark:https://youtu.be/cVGp2FZmVA4  Evelyn Farkas has stated freely on TV that she and a group of associates from the Obama Administration went to congressional staffers who did not have access to these COMINT products and urged them to seek to gain access to them.At some point in the recent past Farkas was de-briefed (cut off) from access to the various kinds of compartmented information she had been given as a requirement of her prior job. When that occurred she signed some papers in which she accepted the responsibility to protect the secrecy of that information. (link)  Evelyn Farkas is also a senior fellow of the Atlantic Council  SEE HERE  the Atlantic Council is funded in part by the US State Department, NATO, the governments of Latvia and Lithuania, the Ukrainian World Congress, and the Ukrainian oligarch Victor Pinchuk. The Atlantic Council has been among the loudest voices calling for a new Cold War with RussiaAnd guess who else is a senior fellow of the Atlantic Council? Dimitri Alperovitch   the founder and CTO of CrowdStrike! Alperovitch is head honcho of the Atlantic Council s  Cyber Statecraft Initiative .  CrowdStrike, aka Dimitri Alperovitch was the organization that initially claimed they had evidence the Russians were connected to the Trump organization.

However, in addition to pushing the false Trump Russian conspiracy narrative, Farkas has knowledge of the outcome of the original pushing of the narrative leading to actual surveillance of the Trump team.This bolsters the information already presented by Devin Nunes that an entirely separate network of surveillance, unrelated to the Russian conspiracy story, was directly targeting the candidacy of Trump and the post-election surveillance of the President Elect Trump-transition team.For entire story: The Conservative Treehouse",left-news,"Mar 29, 2017",5079
WOW! FBI SUED Over Andrew Breitbart Records Request…What Are They Withholding?,"The speech he gave to a sold out crowd on Saturday is epic. We often listen to it to get fired up about bringing down the commies currently trying to destroy America. It s truly epic! THE SPEECH THAT BREITBART IS BEST KNOWN FOR IS HIS CPAC SPEECH:The complaint, filed Friday in federal court in California, says that Leopold filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the FBI for  all records related to Andrew Breitbart  on Aug. 7, 2012, a few months after Breitbart died at age 43.According to the suit, the FBI responded to the request on Sept. 4, but said that the bureau only searched it  main file records,  claiming that no records were located.The complaint says that Leopold appealed the FBI s response but was denied by the U.S. Department of Justice Office of Information in 2013. In its appeal decision, OIP claimed that the FBI is not required to perform cross-reference searches unless the requester provides  information sufficient to enable the FBI to determine with certainty that any cross-references it locates are identifiable to the subject of [the] request,  including, for example, the dates and locations of contacts between the subject of the request and the FBI, the subject s social security number, or other such information,  the suit reads.However, BuzzFeed and Leopold contend in the complaint,  Nothing in the FOIA statute requires a requester to provide this information before a cross-reference search must be conducted. As FBI and OIP are certainly aware, Andrew Breitbart was a well-known public figure and is easily identifiable by the FBI in conducting a cross-reference search,  the suit reads.  As the FBI and OIP are also aware, cross-reference searches frequently turn up records not located in main file searches. Via: THE WRAP",Government News,"Apr 8, 2017",1775

Wade says he did not attend the function, which was on Tuesday.Last year, a team of Washington Post reporters, including Pulitzer Prize-winner Wesley Lowery, included Wade in a profile of Black Lives Matter activists who protested after the August 2014 shooting of Michael Brown by Ferguson, Mo. police officer Darren Wilson. According to the police report, an undercover officer with the vice intelligence unit responded to an ad on backpage.com, a website frequently used by sex traffickers and prostitutes. Holla at me. Quick stay specials tonight and tomorrow. Independent. Fun and sexy. Text me to set up an appointment???????  reads the ad, which listed the age of the poster as 23.The undercover detective contacted the poster to set up a meeting. The respondent informed him that the cost of services would be $100 for a half-hour and provided an address, which turned out to be a Howard Johnson Inn in College Park. A room number was also provided.When the undercover john arrived, a white female wearing only a towel answered the door and let him inside the room. After she attempted to initiate contact with the detective he informed her he was a police officer, and she ran out of the room. Members of the Vice Intelligence Unit described a male that was watching the Undercover Detective as he entered [room 412],  the report reads.Investigators reported that the teenager, who gave her age as 17, said that Wade was her  manager.  She called him  CJ. Wade, who used a passport to rent the Howard Johnson Inn room, was arrested and charged with sex trafficking. Police recovered three cell phones from him.The alleged victim told investigators that Wade knew she was a minor. She said that he told her he was not concerned about her age because  you only have 5 months left until you re 18 so I m not worried. She also told investigators that she provided all the money she was paid to Wade.In response to TheDC s request for comment, Wade claimed that a tenant at a temporary housing facility he was running as part of his charity  was involved in activities  that he did not know about. As this is a legal matter, I m not going into serious detail with you,  he said.He did claim, however, that he was unfairly arrested because he was  too trusting. Despite those claims, the police report suggests that there is evidence that Wade was the person who communicated with the undercover detective by text message.Wade issued a statement on Twitter after being contacted by TheDC in which he blamed conservative  trolls  for focusing on the case. He also said  I am confident that I will be cleared of the charges I am currently facing. I was forced to make this statement before I was ready to because of ongoing efforts by Twitter  trolls  to stop my work and the work of my organization,  he wrote. For the past two to three days,  trolls  have been actively baiting conservative news outlets to report on my arrest, amongst other vindictive things that they are actively working on. Wade also stated that the recent arrest is the second time he has been arrested after  helping someone else.  He did not provide details of the case, but a review of criminal databases shows he was charged with 3rd degree grand theft in Miami in January. Wade says he was not convicted in the case nor did he take a plea deal. Records show that the case was closed in February.Wade was also arrested in August 2014 in Travis County, Tex. and charged with making false statements.For entire story: Daily Caller ",left-news,"May 19, 2016",5168
THE BRUTAL TRUTH ABOUT BENGHAZI: ’13 HOURS’ In-Home Sales BLOW UP Right Before The Election! Hillary Wants This GONE! [VIDEO],"Any guesses as to who is playing our criminal Secretary of State or our lying  Commander in Chief? The movie, based on Mitchell Zuckoff s 2014 book 13 Hours: The Inside Account of What Really Happened in Benghazi, tells the story of the September 11, 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya in which four Americans U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, U.S. Foreign Service s Sean Smith and CIA contractors Glen Doherty and Tyrone S. Woods   were killed by Islamist terrorists.Bay is directing the film from a script by Chuck Hogan (FX s The Strain). James Badge Dale, John Krasinski, Pablo Schreiber, Toby Stephens, David Denman, Max Martini, and Dominic Fumusa star.The trailer conveys a strong sense of dread before the classic Bay-inspired action kicks in. When everything went wrong, six men had the courage to do what was right,  the text in the trailer reads.With a budget reportedly in the range of $30-$40 million, Bay is working on 13 Hours with a lot less money than he usually gets to play with on blockbuster films like Transformers. Here s hoping the result is a return to form for Bay and a tight, focused action film that honors the memories of the American heroes who sacrificed their lives on that day.13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi hits theaters January 15.Via: Breitbart News",Government News,"Jul 29, 2015",1331
UNBELIEVABLE: IL City Denies Re-zoning Request For Islamic Worship Center…That’s When Obama’s Radical DOJ Stepped In,"Mums the word on Christian persecution in the White House.  Just let them get a whiff of possible injustice against a Muslim in America and Obama s radicalized DOJ is on it, like a dog on a bone In its latest effort to protect Muslim rights in the United States the Obama Justice Department is suing an Illinois town for denying a rezoning application to convert an office building into an Islamic temple. Failing to approve plans for the Islamic worship center violates a 2000 law known as the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA), according to a Department of Justice (DOJ) lawsuit filed this week in federal court. The accused are lawmakers in Des Plaines, a Chicago suburb with a population of about 60,000. In 2013 the Des Plaines City Council voted 5-3 to reject a rezoning request made by the American Islamic Center (AIC) to make a vacant office building in a manufacturing zone to an institutional zone that would allow a worship center.The plan called for 3,661 square feet of worship space that would be used for prayer services on Fridays and Sundays as well as nightly prayers during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan when Muslims fast and commemorate the first revelation of the Quran to Muhammad. The new temple would also be used for youth group events and other gatherings, according the rezoning application.In nixing the plan, Des Plaines aldermen expressed concern about the loss of tax revenue since religious institutions are nonprofits that don t pay taxes. They also cited traffic and safety issues for voting against the project.In its lawsuit the DOJ dismisses those issues and claims that the city s  treatment and denial of AICs rezoning requests constitutes the imposition or implementation of a land use regulation that imposes a substantial burden on AICs religious exercise.  Denying a city zoning change to accommodate a Muslim temple also discriminates against the Islamic group on the basis of religion, according to the feds. Attorney General Loretta Lynch wants the court to issue an order forcing Des Plaines to let AIC construct its worship center in the city. The ability to establish a place for collective worship is a fundamental protection of the First Amendment and our civil rights laws,  said Vanita Gupta, head of the DOJ s bloated civil rights division, in a statement announcing the lawsuit.  The Justice Department will remain vigilant in its mission to ensure that all religious groups enjoy the right to practice their faiths freely.  The federal prosecutor handling the case in Illinois said  the freedom to practice the religion of one s choosing is a precious right in our country  and the DOJ will continue to  enforce the laws that protect this important right. The DOJ s enthusiasm for protecting Muslim rights is in a class of its own, however. Back in 2010 Obama s first Attorney General, Eric Holder, personally reassured Muslims of DOJ protection during an address at a San Francisco-based organization (Muslim Advocates) that urges members not to cooperate in federal terrorism investigations. It was a first for the nation s top federal prosecutor to publicly condone illegal behavior. A few years later the DOJ warned against using social media to spread information considered inflammatory against Muslims and threatened that it could constitute a violation of civil rights.One of the biggest and most unbelievable moves by the DOJ came in 2012 when it issued a broad order changing the way the U.S. government trains federal agents to combat terrorism and violent extremism by eliminating all materials that shed a negative light on Muslims. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) actually destroyed instructional material that characterized Muslims as prone to violence or terrorism and hundreds of pages from the 9/11 attacks were purged because they were considered offensive to Muslims under the new initiative.In 2013 Judicial Watch published an in-depth report documenting and analyzing Islamist active measures and influence operations targeting anti-terrorism training in the U.S.Via: Family Security Matters",politics,"Oct 5, 2015",4112
 Cruz’s Latest Shameful Fundraising Scam Is So Absurdly Illegal It’s Like He Wants To Be Caught,"To compete with his frenemy Donald Trump, Texas Senator Ted Cruz has hit upon an old, if dubious, campaign strategy: Lie, cheat, and steal his way to victory.In what is becoming a pattern with the Tea Party conservative, Cruz has yet again sent election officials scrambling to their rulebooks.Desperate for money to fund his campaign, Cruz told supporters that a group of super-secret  mega-donors  had personally promised him that they would match ALL of Ted s donations dollar-for-dollar within the next 48 hours. Cruz begged for people to join on this campaign buy one, get one.I just got off the phone with a few very generous supporters who   after our big win in Iowa last night   have pledged huge support for my campaign.For the next 48 hours, these most generous supporters have agreed to match all online donations to my campaign made through the link below.If that sounds like a scam you might find floating between your most gullible Facebook friends, that s because it just might be.The problem, as The Intercept was quick to point out, was that either Cruz is lying or breaking the law. Pick your poison, Ted.Campaign finance experts, however, say there s no way Cruz could be doing exactly what he promised without violating the law. That s because there s no way  a few very generous supporters  could legally be matching a large number of contributions to the campaign.The operative rule is that individual donations to campaigns are legally capped.  If this money is going to his campaign, any one of those donors can only give a maximum of $2,700 [per cycle] including any money they have given before,  said Fred Wertheimer, a campaign finance expert at Democracy 21.In other words, rich donors and poor donors can only donate up to a certain amount. So what s a mega-donor to do? That s where Super PACs come in. But here s the thing: Cruz can t coordinate with his Super PACS without breaking the law. So how can he be instructing his rich friends to match his campaign contributions?The other option, of course, is that Ted Cruz is lying. There are no super-secret mega-donors. Cruz just wants to get people running for their checkbooks. This is a pretty strong possibility because blatantly spreading falsehoods is absolutely in Cruz s wheelhouse.Cruz has been fairly open about running a dishonest campaign from the very beginning. Already reviled by Democrats and Republicans alike, the only way he has managed to get a leg up has been through deceit and pandering. In Iowa, Cruz s propensity for sliminess came to a head when his campaign sent out fliers telling voters they had committed  Voting Violations  and   on the night of the caucus   maliciously spreading false rumors that Ben Carson, one of Cruz s biggest rivals, had suddenly dropped out.Is it so hard to imagine that Cruz would lie to the very people who support him in order to trick them into giving him more money? Sadly, it s completely believable.Feature image via Flickr",News,"February 5, 2016",2968
"OINK, OINK! 2015 PIG BOOK SHOWS LAWMAKERS APPROPRIATING GLUTTONOUS SPENDING","WHAT MORATORIUM? These guys in Congress are getting around the moratorium and spending like drunken sailors er pigs Stop the madness!Congress has appropriated over $4 billion earmarks this year despite a ban on pork barrel spending, Citizens Against Government Waste (CAGW) announced on Wednesday.The group unveiled the 23rd edition of its Pig Book at the Phoenix Park Hotel near Capitol Hill, revealing millions in earmarks for  fish passage,   embryo adoption awareness,  and abstinence education. The 2015 Pig Book continues to prove that any earmark is a bad earmark,  CAGW president Tom Schatz said.  At a time when members of Congress from both sides of the aisle and both sides of the Capitol continue to call for a restoration of earmarks, taxpayers should deliver a loud and clear message that it is time for earmarks to be permanently banned. Congress has been operating under a self-imposed earmark moratorium since 2010. However, lawmakers have found ways to get around the moratorium.CAGW found the cost of earmarks increased from $2.7 billion to $4.2 billion between fiscal years 2014 and 2015.The report highlights $2.6 million earmarked for the Denali Commission, a 1998 program to build infrastructure in rural Alaska that President Obama wanted to eliminate in 2012. Since FY 2000, 26 projects worth $295.8 million have been earmarked for the Denali Commission, including requests by Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee member Lisa Murkowski (R., Alaska), Sen. Mark Begich (D., Alaska), and the late Sen. Ted Stevens (R., Alaska),  according to the Pig Book.Read more: WFB",Government News,"May 13, 2015",1606
 Trump Just Started Following ‘Emergency Kittens’ On Twitter; It’s Pretty Damn Hilarious (IMAGES),"You can often figure a lot out about a person by what they pay attention to, and in the age of Twitter, by who they follow on Twitter. And while Donald Trump follows his kids, his organization, and many higher-ups in the GOP, he also just started following a new profile   Emergency Kittens.See here:via TwitterNow, there s the obvious joke that Trump following a profile that claims to critique cats is very befitting, considering he loves to critique women and has referred to a specific body part as, well, you know. However, let s try to look past that, and look more at the fact that the next president is staring at kittens on Twitter and only following 43 profiles, including that one.What sorts of tweets does Emergency Kittens put out?

Not sure whether to appreciate the fact that he likes looking at adorable kitten photos, proving he may, in fact, actually be human, or be slightly alarmed that the president-elect may need to look at these photos as a means to calm down. Either way   it s still funny.UPDATE: He has since stopped following the kittens. Too bad, really. Featured Photo by Joe Raedle, Twitter/Getty Images",News,"January 2, 2017",2064

OUTRAGEOUS: ILLINOIS SCHOOL USES FINGERPRINT Scanner To “Track” Kids…America Yawns,"We re living in a world where we have willingly surrendered our privacy for the sake of making identification of ourselves, and our children more convenient for our government and for private businesses and entertainment venues like Disney World. Students and faculty at Harrison Street Elementary School just love the new thumbprint scanner in the school s lunch line, but civil rights experts are warning parents about serious privacy concerns with the technology.The Geneva Unit District 304 replaced a different biometric scanner system for school lunch lines this year with devices from a local company, PushCoin Inc., that read students  thumb prints to track their accounts, the Daily Herald reports. It s good, because you don t have to carry your own money or anything like that,  fifth-grader Quinlan Bobeczko told the news site.  It s just there. Your thumb is easy, because you just have to put your thumb on (the device). Officials in several area school districts are watching District 304 in hopes of installing similar devices in their schools.East Maine Elementary District 63 spokeswoman Janet Bishop said the district hired PushCoin Inc. this spring to begin offering the thumb scan option this month, and Lake Zurich Unit District 95 board president Doug Goldberg said schools there will implement the biometric scanners in the 2016-17 school year, the Daily Herald reports. I will tell you that many of the kids aren t very good about keeping track of their ID cards,  Goldberg said.  And so moving to biometrics was felt to be sort of the next generation of that individual, unique ID. We ll record their thumbprints, there will be thumbprint readers at all the cash registers, and they ll simply come by and   bang   hit their thumbprint. It makes it faster and, also, there s a lot less opportunity for any kind of misuse or fraud when they re using biometrics. PushCoin Inc. allows parents to closely monitor their children s lunch accounts through email updates, and the company s CEO, Anna Lisznianski contends the scanners can help school officials use lunch time more efficiently.",left-news,"May 5, 2016",2109
WHOA! BREAKING NEWS: CNN Producer Caught On Undercover Tape Admitting Trump-Russia Coverage Is BULLSH*T…”President Is Right To Say You Are ‘Witch Hunting’ Me” (VIDEO),"James O Keefe s Project Veritas reporters went undercover at CNN to investigate the #VeryFakeNews network to determine the motivation behind CNN s Trump-Russia collusion obsession. Since the inauguration, CNN has mentioned  Russian story  nearly 16,000 times.Project Veritas  reporters can be seen in the video below having a conversation with CNN s supervising producer John Bonifield. The reporter talked to Bonifield first about the constant barrage of Trump-Russia stories on CNN. Bonifield admitted that although CNN has no evidence or proof of Trump involvement with Russia, they continue to make it their top story on CNN simply for  ratings  and to  make money.  Bonifield has worked as a journalist and as a producer for nearly 15 years at CNN, making him a pretty reliable source when it comes to how things work at CNN.Bonifield actually confessed to the undercover Project Veritas journalist that President Trump is correct when he says the media is on a  witch hunt  to take him down. Bonifield told the reporter:  I think the President is right to say, like, look you are  witch hunting me  You have no real smoking gun, you have no proof. Bonifield told the undercover reporter for Project Veritas that CNN is biased and is playing to their audience by attacking President Trump, and actually admitted that  Trump is good for business right now.  The Project Veritas reporter asked Bonifield,  But honestly, you think the whole Russia shit is bullshit?  to which Bonifield replied:  Could be bullshit. I mean, it s mostly bullshit right now. Like, we don t have any big, giant proof. The way these leaks happen, they d leak it. It d leak. If it was something really good, it would leak.

COLLEGE PROFESSOR CAUGHT ON TAPE: You Can’t Have Peace If ‘Whiteness’ Exists…Poor Whites Also Have ‘Privilege”,"Close your eyes and imagine a white professor telling his students there will be no peace as long as  blackness  exists. Now picture that teacher in the unemployment line with about 100 cameras and reporters around him demanding he apologize for his blatant racism. Imagine how many hard working parents are scrimping and saving to send their children to college to be part of a captive audience in this racist s classroom. Parents better start speaking up and demanding these colleges and universities hold these radical, racist professors accountable for the things they are  teaching  our children. No one else is going to do it for us James Harrison, history professor at Portland Community College, said in a lecture Monday for the college s April Whiteness History Month that peace in the U.S. is impossible so long as whiteness still exists.In a talk entitled  Imagine A World Without Whiteness,  Harrison declared confidently conflict can only cease once the power structure of whiteness is totally eliminated. Imagine everyone living life in peace,  Harrison said, building off John Lennon s famous song  Imagine. And how do we get to that good world is the question   a world without conflict. And to me, my interpretation of these words, is it would be a world, or U.S., without whiteness, in terms of the power structure,  Harrison said, offering his own interpretation of Lennon s song. Can there be a world without whiteness, a world in which white privilege doesn t exist?  Harrison asked his audience. My answer is yes, we can, because it s happened before, and it all revolves around individuals taking small steps to dismantle and demolish the whole concept.  The effort is working. Harrison said whiteness is on the retreat, noting estimates indicate whites will no longer be a majority in the United States by 2040 or 2050.But do poor whites have white privilege? Harrison answered in the affirmative. Most whites, even poor whites, he said, don t recognize they have white privilege because it s invisible.

" Donald Trump Makes Pathetic, Racist Swipe At President Obama For Visiting A Mosque (VIDEO)","President Obama s speech from a mosque in Baltimore, Maryland this week was welcomed by most as an important and timely gesture to bring together Americans of all faiths and none. But for Donald Trump, is was a chance to sow the seeds of division with a truly pathetic, racist reaction.Obama s visit to the Islamic Society of Baltimore was the first time in U.S. history that a President has delivered a speech from an American mosque. Given the rise of hate crimes against Muslim American and their places of worship, and unprecedented attacks on the faith from conservative lawmakers and media, this visit was much-needed.The center says on its website that it  aspires to be the anchor of a growing Muslim community with diverse backgrounds, democratically governed, relating to one another with inclusiveness and tolerance, and interacting with neighbors in an Islamic exemplary manner. Obama endorsed this message and made an impassioned call for moderates on all sides of the political and faith spectrum to come together around their common humanity. He explicitly rejected the inexcusable political rhetoric against Muslim-Americans made by the likes of Donald Trump, and other Republican presidential candidates.He replaced their rhetoric with a powerful and unambiguous message of hope and community: Let me say as clearly as I can as president of the United States: you fit right here, You re right where you belong. You re part of America too. You re not Muslim or American. You re Muslim and American. What was Donald Trump s detailed, profound political response to this groundbreaking effort? Speaking on Fox News, in an interview with Greta Van Susteren, Trump responded: I don t know if maybe he feels comfortable there. Because he is a Kenyan Muslim Socialist? I mean, come on Trump. And how do we know it s just a case of Obama putting his Muslim brothers above  natural born Americans? We have a lot of problems in this country,  Trump explained.  We have a lot of places he can go and he chose a mosque. The reason Trump sinks to playing the race card with his reaction, is because it s actually the only card he has to play. He has no platform, no ideas, no vision for America. He only has a direct line to the prejudices of Republican voters and Fox viewers. It ll get him coverage alright, but it sure as hell won t get him to the White House.Featured Image via Screengrab/Screengrab",News,"February 4, 2016",2407
The Jerusalem Decision: From Creative Chaos to Effective Turmoil," Dr Can Erimtan 21st Century WireDid Donald J. Trump have any idea about the impact his words would have across the world?!? Did he have any idea that the whole wide world, including the United Nations, would turn against him?On Wednesday, 6 December 2017, in the White House s Diplomatic Reception Room the President of the United States proceeded to make history, or, proceeded to leave his personal mark on the flow of world events as his words set a whole chain of global events in motion: I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. While previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver. Today, I am delivering. In his preamble to this potentially explosive and arguably rather disconcerting statement, Trump explained that  [i]n 1995, [under Bill Clinton s watch, that is] Congress adopted the Jerusalem Embassy Act, urging the federal government to relocate the American embassy to Jerusalem and to recognize that that city   and so importantly   is Israel s capital. This act passed Congress by an overwhelming bipartisan majority and was reaffirmed by a unanimous vote of the Senate only six months ago.  In this way, the 45th U.S. President showed himself to have been cut from a completely different cloth indeed, as he uttered words that neither Bill Clinton, nor George W. Bush or, more importantly perhaps, Barack Obama had dared speak.Yes, Trump openly came out and made plain the deep love that dare not speak its name   in spite of the vehemently pro-Israel stance taken by the U.S. ever since the time of President Eisenhower (1953-61) and particularly, ever since the Six Day War (5-10 June 1967), in spite of the ceaseless activities of AIPAC and J Street, no previous incumbent had dared bestow a bona fide U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem as a physical token of the deep and ardent bonds between the New World and the Promised Land. Only, Donald J. Trump had the gall to  deliver,  doing what Clinton had promised yet none of his successors had been able to realise . . . until now, that is.In true Aristotelian fashion Trump took the potentiality that was Jerusalem (known as Al Quds or the Sacred City in the Muslim world) and turned it into an actuality by means of pledging full ambassadorial honours for the ancient city. Following these presidential words, outspoken Israeli voices did not take long to heap praise on the White House. Mark Regev, the erstwhile spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Jerusalem (2004-7) and frequent Israeli apologist appearing on various mainstream media, and currently even active as Israeli Ambassador in London (since 2015) blurted out that he  think[s] this was a just move and a good move for peace. His boss, Bibi or Benjamin Netanyahu (fourth premiership, 2015 present) was equally forthcoming, talking to the press on the same day the U.S. President made his performance in the Diplomatic Reception Room:  Thank you President Trump for today s historic decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital. The Jewish people and the Jewish state will be forever grateful.  The PM in the next instance also echoed his ambassador s words, declaring that  [t]here is no peace that doesn t include Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The idea that Jerusalem should be at the heart of the Jewish people s  land and nation namely has its roots in the Bible, in 2 Chronicles 6:5-6, to be precise:  Since the day I brought my people out of Egypt, I have not chosen a city in any tribe of Israel to have a temple built so that my Name might be there, nor have I chosen anyone to be ruler over my people Israel. But now I have chosen Jerusalem for my Name to be there, and I have chosen David to rule my people Israel,  as worded in the New International Version. And Bibi knows that too.Bibi even took his words of praise abroad. First to Paris, where he met with President Emmanuel Macron, who had urged his U.S. counterpart to preserve the city s status quo prior to Trump s Diplomatic Reception Room performance (10 December 2017). Bibi disagreed volubly with the Frenchman, characterising as  absurd  anyone not willing to recognise the  millennial connection of the Jewish people to Jerusalem.  Next, even proceeding to refer to God s word that had elevated Jerusalem to its lofty position as site for his temple:  [y]ou can read it in a very fine book   it s called the Bible.  The following day he went to Brussels, where he attended a meeting of EU Foreign Ministers (11 December 2017). The Israeli PM told the gathered EU FM as well as the assembled press corps that Trump s Jerusalem declaration  makes peace possible because recognizing reality is the substance of peace, the foundation of peace. The Invention of the Jewish People and the Position of Jerusalem in IslamThe state of Israel, as a Jewish nation state implanted on Middle Eastern soil in 1948, employs nationalist myth and religious tradition as credible arguments justifying its mere existence. The Israeli journalist and author Daniel Gavron, for example, states that  most Israelis [regard it as] axiomatic that the celebrations for the 3,000th anniversary of the conquest of Jerusalem by King David [in 1995] mark[ed] a real and tangible event,  even though he himself doubts its authenticity. In other words, the Jewish people, as a shorthand for the Israeli citzenry, have apparently already been following the political and ideological leanings currently exhorted by Bibi for quite a while. But, as I explained at length some time ago, the mere mention of the term  nation  or even just  people  is a problematic issue in its own right   the point that I am trying to get across is that  nations  or  people  cannot be perceived as  natural  or even  organic  phenomena, but rather as contrived and constructed social units consisting of individuals who willingly become part of a larger  artificial  whole through the manipulation and management of larger forces and structures   leaders of men and their organisations. It has been nearly ten years now that the historian Schlomo Sand published his groundbreaking text The Invention of the Jewish People, which attempted to popularise the theoretical constructs of writers and thinkers like Benedict Anderson and Ernst Gellner, amongst others, but, as seems blatantly apparent from looking at Bibi s recent proclamations, his message has clearly failed to penetrate the academic bubble, in spite of having topped Israeli bestseller list  for nineteen weeks. With regard to the city of Jerusalem, on the other hand, archeological evidence appears to prove conclusivedly that the  site has been continuously occupied for some 5,000 years,  signalling the urban centre s pre-Jewish roots. But the notion that King David conquered the place to establish the one true god s temple seems rather shaky. Gavron explains that the  biblical account of the capture of the city is the only one we have, and in the opinion of most modern scholars, the Bible is not an entirely reliable historical document.  Still, archeological excavations carried out in the summer of 1993 appear to have produced evidence that a certain David indeed founded a dynastic live in the 10th century BCE   namely, a small  triangular piece of basalt rock . . . subsequently identified as part of a victory pillar erected by the king of Syria and later smashed by an Israelite ruler  carrying an Aramaic inscription talking about a  Beit David ( House  or  Dynasty of David ). But the Jewish  conquest  of Jerusalem did not mark the end of the city s story of military takeover and/or occupation: remaining in ancient times, the Assyrian King Sennacherib laid siege to the city in the year 701 BCE, whereas the Babylonian Nebuchadnezzar captured the city in the seventh year of his reign (598 BCE), but of greater importance is the sack and destruction of the city and its temple at the hands of Titus, son of the Roman Emperor Vespasian (70 CE), in response to the Jews  Great Revolt against Rome that had sprung up in 66 CE. The ultimate outcome of Rome s harsh response was the  Diaspora,  as explained by the American rabbi, lecturer, and author Joseph Telushkin, who estimates that  as many as one million Jews died  as a result, while carrying in its wake the  almost two-thousand-year span of Jewish homelessness and exile.  With the majority of Jews apparently dispersed from the land and city, Jerusalem was eventually conquered by the Caliph Umar (reign 634-44) in the year 638, an event which seems to have taken place following a  peaceful siege, no blood was shed,  in the words of Zia H Shah, a New York-based physician and the Chief Editor of the Muslim Times. The addition of Jerusalem to the Dar al-Islam (or, the abode of Islam) was important. Though the city s name does not appear specifically in the Quran (containing only a reference to  al-Masjid al- Aqsa  or the  Furthest Mosque,  17:1), it is the locus of the Prophet s miraculous Night Journey (or Mi raj). The story, as related in various prophetic traditions (or hadith), tells how the figure of the Prophet travelled from  Makkah to the Furthest Mosque (in Jerusalem), from whence he ascended Heaven, so that Allah might  show him of Our signs. As a result, the Masjid al- Aqsa, arguably built by the Caliph Umar though no historical records exist to this effect, is regarded as the third most sacred mosque in Islam, following the Masjid Al-Haram in Makkah, and Al Masjid An-Nabawi in Madinah.A Pseudo-Ottoman Gambit: Diverting Attention for a PurposeAs a result, Donald Trump s Diplomatic Reception Room stunt far supersedes the thorny Palestinian issue, the life-and-death matter of peace in the Middle East, or even the real estate division between East and West Jerusalem. The English-language pan-Arab television channel Al Jazeera English matter-of-factly point out on its website that  [v]iolence, protests and arrests have followed US President Donald Trump s decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. All across the globe Muslims have taken to the street to voice their disapproval of Trump s latest attempt to act like a real president, a president unlike any of his predecessors:  [r]allies against Trump s decision also took place in the Indian city of Mumbai, the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, and the Japanese capital, Tokyo.  But also in Turkey   where President Recept Tayyip Erdo an (aka the Prez)  has been at pains for years to appear as a rightful heir to the Ottoman sultans of old   after all, Sultan Selim I (1512-20) took hold of the city of Jerusalem in 1517, remaining part of the Ottoman fold till the onset of the British Mandate (1917-48). On Thursday and Friday, (7-8 December 2017),  spontaneous  meetings took place throughout the whole of the country, from Istanbul over Bursa, Ankara, and Mersin, to Hatay, Gaziantep, Tatvan, Adana, Van, and Kahramanmara . More importantly, the 57-member Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) held a meeting in Istanbul on 13 December 2017, and the Prez employed this platform to portray himself as the ultimate champion of Islam, defying not just the United States of America and Israel, but also the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the nominal Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. As I have written quite some time ago, the Prez is more than determined to challenge his erstwhile friend and ally King Salman and see himself as the rightful Calip of the world of Islam, in true pseudo-Ottoman fashion.The OIC meeting dutifully released its  Istanbul Declaration on  Freedom for Al Quds' : [a]ppreciating the Republic of Turkey and the Turkish people for hosting the Extraordinary Islamic Summit regarding this important cause of Ummah, especially the call for this Extraordinary Summit made by His Excellency Recep Tayyip Erdo an (image, left), President of the Republic of Turkey . . . We reject and condemn the US Administration s unlawful statement regarding the status of Al Quds . . . Just like the fact that Israel s decision to annex Al Quds and its actions and practices therewith are never accepted, we declare that this statement is identically null and void from the point of view of conscience, justice and history. We invite all members of the UN, the EU and the international community to remain committed to the status of Al Quds and all related UN Resolutions. Rather than accomplishing anything much at all, the extraordinary OIC meeting primarily served to heighten Tayyip  Erdo an s prestige, at home as well as abroad. As such, a cynic would say that Trump s timing was impeccable, as 17/25 December marks the anniversary of the scandal variously known as #AKPgate that erupted in 2013, and that presently was very much on people s minds in Turkey given that the Turkish-Iranian businessman Reza Zarrab (or R za Sarraf, in Turkish) was appearing in court in New York. The court case investigates breaches of the sanctions placed upon Iran and many Turks eagerly followed the proceedings on Twitter. One Istanbul-based writer Kareem Shaheen described the accusations as follows:  [i]n a case that has strained relations between Turkey and the US, Reza Zarrab, a Turkish-Iranian gold trader, described a sprawling money laundering network that allowed Iran access to international markets from 2010 to 2015 in violation of sanctions over its nuclear programme. He told jurors in New York on Thursday [30 November 2017] that [Tayyip] Erdo an, who was prime minister of Turkey at the time, had personally authorised a transaction on behalf of Iran. Zarrab said he had [also] bribed the then Turkish economy minister Zafer  a layan and the former head of the state-owned Halkbank. As a result, given that the Zarrab case all but exacerbated the dire Turco-American relationship, Trump s Jerusalem declaration must have come as a welcome bolt from the blue for Erdogan. The decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel s capital finally absolved the Erdogan from any attempts to salvage the cross-Atlantic relationship, and instead emboldened him to announce publicly that the Republic of Turkey is now the rightful heir to the Ottoman Empire and the only hope left for Muslims across the world, Muslims that have been victimised by years and years of oppressive U.S. foreign policy. And, putting a cherry on top of the proverbial cake of discontent, Erdo an announced on Thursday, 17 December 2017, that he would establish a Turkish Embassy in Jerusalem, representing Ankara in Palestine, to be clear. Speaking to an audience of faithful followers in the city of Karaman, the Prez declared  God willing, the day is close when officially, with God s permission, we will open our embassy there,  in Jerusalem.All the while, the Palestinian people continue to suffer and Israel employs any and every pretext available to stage military assaults on the Gaza strip and crack down on Palestinian protesters But, Trump has done his deed, leaving his indelible mark on the Middle East, while the Prez, in turn, can now rightfully claim that he alone is able to represent the Muslim world on the international arena.*** 21WIRE special contributor Dr. Can Erimtan is an independent scholar who was living in Istanbul for some time, with a wide interest in the politics, history and culture of the Balkans and the Greater Middle East.

HOLY GLOBALIST SLAM! Nigel Farage Brilliantly DESTROYS EU Hypocrites Over Their Trashing Of President Trump [VIDEO]," It seems to me that actually with all of the anti-Trump rhetoric that is coming from everywhere actually what we re hearing is the true nature of the EU project which is genuine anti-Americanism.  Trump is motivated by protecting the United States of America from Islamic terrorism, where as what has happened in this room and in governments around Europe is that you would welcome these people into your own homes.But could we please, just for a moment look at the facts? Amongst all the hyperbole and the hysteria, all that Donald Trump has done is taken 7 countries that were identified by President Obama as posing a risk to the USA.Where were you when Obama in 2011 banned any Iraqi from going into the country for 6 months? As an added bonus, watch Nigel Farage explains to the whiny liberal BBC host Andrew Neil why Donald Trump is right on defending the United States by putting more strenuous vetting in place in America, and why he s doing exactly what the majority of Americans elected him to do:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAl6wx2aYvY",politics,"Feb 1, 2017",1051
 Bristol Palin’s Absurd Blog Post About Gun Safety Will Make You Weep For Her Children (VIDEO),"Bristol Palin has shown yet again not only how incredibly dense she is, but just how her children could suffer from her ineptitude as a parent and reasonable human being. Her latest Patheos blog post talks about just how lucky her son is to have grown up around guns because of an asinine gun control experiment out of Texas specifically aimed at gun sales to families. It s actually quite sickening.In the video, children are left into a room full of toys, among which is hidden an unloaded handgun. Within 15 seconds a child finds the gun and begins treating it like any of the other toys in the room. Parents stand horrified as their children, cast into an unsupervised play environment, take the gun and point it at each other. In the end, a police officer helping conduct this bogus  experiment  points out that the children playing with the gun come from a home with no guns, where the two children who wouldn t touch the gun come from homes where guns are available and talked about.That s what Bristol Palin decides to jump on. Finally, someone is calling her a good parent, which is, of course, ludicrous, but she seems to be comfortable with it. She wrote: Only the children whose homes had exposed them to guns knew not to touch the dangerous toy. As other children ran around pointing it at each other, two stood back because their parents understood the importance of teaching and appropriate exposure.Parents assume their child will automatically know what is and is not dangerous. The danger is not guns themselves, but a lack of education.So thankful Tripp is around guns and knows how to act around them. The danger is not the gun itself but a lack of education? What a crock of doody. This is America, Bristol. The bulk of guns owned by civilians are because of a lack of education. People believe guns make them safer, that they can thwart crimes and that they are somehow more patriotic for having one. The reality is far simpler: If there were fewer guns, fewer people would get shot.The entire scenario is designed to portray people who don t own guns as bad parents, because their children have no experience with guns. The two kinds of parents portrayed get the exact result you may expect, but Palin, as dense as she is, takes the lesson to the stupid place, arguing that only children who have been exposed to guns have a chance of growing up safe in America.The two types of parents not included that would round out this experiment would be the idiots who think kids don t need to learn about gun safety as long as you leave the safety on and parents who refuse to have guns in their home and add the benefit of educating their children why they are so dangerous. Those parents aren t needed to prove to someone as ill-prepared for parenthood as Bristol Palin that there may be more to this experiment. The notion that raising your children around guns makes them safer would be much more believable if we didn t have to read about yet another toddler killing his sister or a little guy pulling a gun from the glove compartment and shooting Grandpa. If there were no two-year-olds pulling pistols from their mothers  purse and shooting them in Walmart it may be easier to swallow.What may be a better gauge of how safe non-gun homes are as opposed to homes with guns would be to count the accidental firearm deaths from each. I can guarantee you that my children will never grab a loaded weapon from anywhere in my house and pull the trigger. I can also guarantee that they have seen and been taught exactly how dangerous guns are and wouldn t touch one for any reason in somebody else s home, either.It s all well and good to use these parents who probably haven t considered that their kids may run into guns at their friends  houses as bad examples, but in the end, they go home to a house with no guns; to playrooms where no guns will be hidden. Those  responsible  children? They may not have touched the gun but they are the only ones with true access. To think that is in any way good parenting is mind boggling.Here s the full seven-minute experiment:KWWL   Eastern Iowa Breaking News, Weather, ClosingsFeatured image from Gage Skidmore",News,"March 5, 2016",4172
NASTY WOMEN! Ivanka Trump BOOED…HISSED By Unbelievably Rude Crowd During Panel Discussion On Women In Germany [VIDEO],"She s no stranger to nasty women in America who can t seem to get past their hate for her father to see that Ivanka Trump is a passionate advocate for women and a strong role model for working women raising a family. Ivanka is an incredibly hard working woman who is very accomplished. She s everything the so-called  feminist movement  should be celebrating, but since her father has taken a pro-life position, all bets are off the table. And unlike children of every previous President and First Lady, the Trump children have been the targets of one vicious attack after another. From the boycotting of Ivanka s clothing and accessory line to Rosie O Donnell accusing young 11-yr old Barron Trump of being autistic to the skanky comedian Chelsea Handler who after finding out that Eric Trump and his wife were expecting their first child tweeted,  Just what we need. Another person with those jeans [sic]. Ivanka Trump on Tuesday faced boos and hisses during a panel discussion at the W20 Summit in Berlin Tuesday morning after she defended her father s record of promoting women in his business before becoming president.The president s daughter was speaking on a panel that included German Chancellor Angela Merkel when she remarked that President Trump is  a tremendous champion  for women and families. That remark drew boos and hisses from the crowd at the panel.She later defended her father, citing media criticism but also clearly responding to people in the room. ",left-news,"Apr 25, 2017",1475
HOW A SIMPLE GLASS OF WATER Could Expose The Truth About Hillary’s Serious Health Issues And Cause Her To Lose The Election [VIDEO],"Every American needs to consider this new evidence about Hillary and how her campaign is helping to hide her poor health from voters unless of course, the only reason you re planning to vote for Hillary is because you like her VP candidate, Tim Kaine Why does Hillary reject a bottle of water for a glass of water during her coughing fit in front of press on her new campaign plane? Why does Hillary have a stool and GLASS OF WATER next to her at all times during public appearances? Why does Hillary tell press she s suffering from allergies when allergens aren t even high in the specific region where she s speaking? Why is Hillary resting while Donald Trump is out running circles around her on the campaign trail? Why does the media cover for her lies and MOST IMPORTANTLY, why is anyone supporting this woman who is clearly not well enough to even campaign for the highest office in our nation???During the Republican National Convention last June, two Secret Service agents approached InfoWars and asked to speak to them about Hillary s health. The Secret Service contacted me. They said that Hillary Clinton has Parkinson s disease. They [Hillary s people] spent over a quarter million dollars on these stairs to allow her to step down from the vehicle to the ground because she has trouble walking. They [Secret Service] said that any kind of flashes or strobes will set her off into a seizure, and that s why they wanted to come us.They wanted to contact us and give us information because they knew we [InforWars] would be able to get this out. [Unlike the MSM,] we wouldn t be scared to do it. And you know it really makes a lot of sense when you watch all these videos. The fact that she s refusing to do these news conferences. Hillary had not done a press conference for 8  months. Her last press conference was on December 4, 2015.DOES HILLARY HAVE PARKINSON S DISEASE?As a neurological disorder, Parkinson s disease (PD) has been shown to affect motor skills in the limbs, inhibit muscle coordination, and sometimes contribute to dysphagia.1   Dysphagia is the medical term for difficulty swallowing. Thickened liquids are often used in the management of dysphagia to improve bolus control and to help prevent aspiration. A range of starches and gums has historically been used to thicken liquids. Although thickened liquids improve swallow safety, they appear to have a great potential for unintended physiological consequences.Like this  unintended physiological consequence  maybe?  Why does Hillary always have a stool and GLASS OF WATER at every public appearance? Don t most people in this day and age drink from a bottle of water?Again the stool and the GLASS OF WATER And again On Feb. 4, WND reported Hillary Clinton has been prescribed Armour Thyroid, a natural medication made from desiccated pig thyroid glands, for her hypothyroid condition and Coumadin   a brand name of warfarin, which initially was developed as a well-known rat poison   for her congenital tendency to form blood clots.WND also reported the medication Clinton has taken since 1998 to deal with her blood-clotting problems may have side effects that are hazardous to her health, including blurred vision and confusion, both of which she has experienced. And a California physician warned Coumadin could be more life-threatening to her than the possibility of a recurring blood clot.Bill Clinton, during a question and answer session at the Peterson Foundation in Washington, on May 14, 2014, told the audience that the concussion Hillary suffered  required six months of very serious work to get over. On Nov. 16, 2015, in an exchange between Hillary Clinton s aides Huma Abedin and Monica Hanley dated Jan. 26, 2013, regarding Clinton s schedule, the aides said it was  very important  to go over phone calls with Clinton because the former secretary of state was  often confused. Clinton s five-minute bathroom break at the third Democratic debate in Goffstown, New Hampshire, on Dec. 19, 2015, initially attributed to the distance of the woman s bathroom from the stage, was reported to have caused a  flare up of problems from brain injury  that required Clinton to sit in a chair off-stage to recover from fatigue, dizziness and disorientation.WND just last week reported that at least 10 prominent physicians have been questioning Hillary Clinton s health.Based on publicly available information, the following physicians have raised concerns:  Dr. Jane Orient, M.D., executive director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, said images of Clinton being helped up stairs and propped up, and videos showing odd, seizure-like head movements require an explanation to voters, she contends. The author of  Emerging Diseases: Protecting Your Family from Pandemics, Viral Threats, and Rogue Vaccines  noted the  vituperation and anger  that she s faced for raising questions.  I m not making a diagnosis,  she told WND on Monday. But  I can look at the video. You can look. She said for a medical professional to simply ignore the evidence would be  completely reckless.  Meeting someone with these symptoms personally would require a  How are you?  she said.  These are not ridiculous questions.  Dr. Lee Hieb, author of  Surviving the Medical Meltdown: Your Guide to Living Through the Disaster of Obamacare,  agreed.  They made a huge deal about [Sen. John] McCain because of his melanoma,  she told WND.  Melanoma doesn t give you dementia!  She said the images and videos are evidence that should be reviewed and explained to voters, contending Clinton is  not being forthcoming. If she doesn t want the American people informed   we know where she stands. Citing Clinton s previous concussion, Hieb said such injuries can cause long-term side effects, seizures, personality changes and cognitive deficits.  The Fox News medical  A-Team  of Dr. Marc Siegel and Dr. David Samadi had questions.  In 2008   I looked over a thousand pages of John McCain s records because of a melanoma he had 10 years ago. What about Hillary? In 2009, a severe fall. She breaks her elbow. In 2011, she boards a plane, falls. In 2012, she has a severe concussion which Bill Clinton says took her six months to recover from,  Siegel said. He continued:  Then she ends up with a blood clot in the brain and a lifetime of blood thinners. Just that point alone   if she s prone to falling, you can see from that picture up there that it looked like she can barely get upstairs without two people carrying her. Guess what if she falls and hits her head? She ll get a blood clot.  Dr. Drew Pinsky s television show on the HLN cable network,  Dr. Drew on Call,  was canceled after he raised questions about Clinton s health in an interview on KABC-AM in Los Angeles. Alt-Right fanatics and conspiracy theorists  immediately questioned her health   is she ok? And concerns over Hillary s  worst coughing fit ever  was raised by MSNBC.But as Paul Josepth Watson reports, MSNBC regurgitated claims by Hillary s campaign aides that,  Allergens were high in Northeast Ohio on Monday,  before asserting that there is  no evidence to indicate she is unwell.

 BREAKING: Trump Is Now Directly Threatening Electors Who Don’t Vote For Him,"If you want to know what kind of President Donald Trump will be, if he will execute the powers of his office in a manner that is fitting for an American President. look no further than his team s recent threats against electors who might be considering voting against our first Russian-installed President-elect.The Electoral college votes on December 19   so while Donald Trump may have kinda-sorta  won  the election by losing the popular vote by a historic margin, there is still a chance that he will not be our next President. Unfortunately for Trump, they seem to be taking the Russian hacking thing seriously, demanding a full briefing before they vote. We intend to discharge our duties as Electors by ensuring that we select a candidate for president who, as our Founding Fathers envisioned, would be  endowed with the requisite qualifications,  the open letter from electors to U.S. Director Of National Intelligence.  [T]he Constitution envisions the Electoral College as a deliberative body that plays a critical role in our system of government   ensuring that the American people elect a president who is constitutionally qualified and fit to serve. According to reports in the Washington Post, New York Times, and other outlets, the United States intelligence community has now concluded definitively that the Russian interference was performed to help Donald Trump get elected, yet even today Mr. Trump is refusing to accept that finding,  the letter continues.  Separate from Mr. Trump s own denials of Russian involvement in the election, the confirmed communication between Trump s aides and those associated with the Russian election interference activity raise serious concerns that must be addressed before we cast our votes. This may present a problem for a guy whom the CIA confirmed had a lot of help from a foreign power via hacking and propaganda, but Trump s solution is simple (terrifyingly simple): threaten them into compliance. We have gotten reports from multiple people,  an elector told Salon under condition of anonymity,  that the Donald Trump campaign is putting pressure on Republican electors to vote for him based on . . . future political outcomes based on whether they vote for Donald Trump or not.  These reports, the elector says, come from Republican electors who say that violence was not threatened   instead, the Trump camp threatened to ruin careers and livelihoods. It s all political, basically,  the elector said.  If Trump becomes the president, he s going to be able to put pressure on the state parties and they won t be involved anymore. Let s think about this for a moment: the expected incoming President of the United States was revealed to have been effectively installed by a foreign power after asking them to hack his political opponents. The intelligence community has confirmed that Russia heard his plea for help and stepped up to get him into office. Now, instead of even feigning surprise, Trump is attacking and threatening anyone and everyone who says anything negative about it   the media, electors, even those same intelligence agencies whose investigations proved inconvenient for him.Keith Olbermann recently pointed out that if Trump assumes office, the chances of us ever having a free election again diminish severely. With Trump now threatening those whose job it is to ensure that a tyrant like him doesn t get into office, he seems to be right.Featured image via Getty Images/Steve Pope",News,"December 13, 2016",3468

HILLARY CLINTON ‘Insulted’ And ‘Embarrassed’ Ambassadors By Refusing to Follow Decorum,"A former member of Hillary Clinton s security detail while she was serving as secretary of state said she frequently and  blatantly  disregarded security and diplomatic protocol during her tenure.An interview with the ex-agent was part of the FBI s newest document release pertaining to the investigation into Clinton s private email server she used while working at the State Department.The source, formerly a member of the State Department s Bureau of Diplomatic Security, explained how the secretary was to ride in an armored limousine with the local U.S. ambassador while traveling abroad, but Clinton  refused to do so,  the agent said,  instead choosing to be accompanied in the limousine by her [deputy] Chief of Staff, Huma Abedin. This frequently resulted in complaints by ambassadors who were insulted and embarrassed by this breach of protocol,  the security official told the FBI.Read more: Daily Mail ",politics,"Oct 17, 2016",914
 Speaker Of The Big House: Child Molester Dennis Hastert To Spend Over A Year In Jail,"Former Speaker Of The House Dennis Hastert got handed the sentence of 15 months in prison for monetary payoffs he made to keep his sexual abuse of young boys silent. The judge in the case called him a  serial child molester,  and also ordered him to enroll in a sex-offender treatment program.Hastert was accused of molesting 4 boys aged 14 to 17, during his time as a coach at Yorkville High School in Illinois. The case came to light when one of them finally broke decades of silence on Hastert s conduct.If you re thinking 15 months for molesting 4 boys is outrageous, you d be correct. Unfortunately, the statute of limitations has expired on the molestation cases. This forced the court to focus on illegal cash withdrawals that Hastert made to pay hush-money in order to keep the crimes buried.As is always the case with your average Republican who does something criminal, there is a news reel of them being hypocritical by attacking others for somewhat similar conduct. Hastert was a very vocal critic of then-President Bill Clinton over the Monica Lewinsky affair. Clearly, Bill was not in any sense as despicable as Hastert. However, that didn t stop Hastert from strongly attacking Clinton for it.Dennis Hastert on the House floor, 1998:When the allegations first came to light, Hastert did what all Republicans do; blame the victim. His initial response was to claim that the money withdrawal was because HE was the one being victimized by a blackmailer over a baseless claim of sexual abuse. This didn t end up working well for Hastert because the judge used it to hand down an even stronger sentence to him, with the judge telling him,  You tried to make him a victim again. U.S. Attorney comments on Hastert:This is yet another case of the universal hypocrisy that is a chronic condition of the Republican party. During a time when Republicans everywhere are trying to pass bathroom laws to  protect people  from the theorized molestations they believe will occur if a transgender individual uses a public bathroom, their party heroes keep getting nailed for doing the very thing they claim to hate.Here s a better idea. Since Republican men do this more than transgender individuals, we will make a  Republican Men s Bathroom.  We can do voter ID checks to make sure Republican men can only use their assigned bathroom because it s a  public safety issue,  as they like to say regarding their anti-LGBT bathroom laws. While we re at it, we can make Republican male-only movie theaters, restaurants and stores to help protect the public from mass shooters.Featured Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images",News,"April 27, 2016",2613
 Hillary Completely Blew Away This Woman Who Receives Terrifying Hate From The Alt-Right,"When Ella Dawson started a blog discussing her trials with genital herpes, along with STI stigma, she expected prudes to come out of the woodwork and snipe at her for putting such a personal topic out for all to see. What she didn t expect was for the dangerous alt-right to find her and make her a target for their sick form of entertainment.When she decided to write about that, she likely also didn t expect to catch the attention of Hillary Clinton, let alone grab it enough to receive a personal letter back.The letter starts with: Thank you for the brave and insightful piece on Medium this week. I am so grateful for you for not only speaking out against the stigma surrounding sexually transmitted infections, but for also taking a courageous stand against the ridiculous, but very real, barrage of hate you have received online. She reiterated that love and kindness are among the central components of her campaign, and that the decline of civil public discourse is one of the more alarming problems in the digital age. Then she dropped this truth bomb: It s going to take all of us, working together, to restore our discourse and that work starts by calling out the bullies, chief among them Donald Trump and the alt-right. Read the whole letter below:Thank you, @HillaryClinton, for reading. I m incredibly moved. To be accurate, I m ugly crying. #ImWithHer pic.twitter.com/kt5tAVWrFX  Ella Dawson (@brosandprose) September 6, 2016The blog post that caught Hillary s attention discusses Dawson s very real and terrible problems with the alt-right. Her broader discussion, though, is about how rape threats, death threats, doxxing, shaming, and more, happen to women all over the Internet because we dare to Internet while female. The sheer gall of us to have an opinion and put it out there   we should, in the eyes of the misogynistic alt-right, stay silent. We bring the harassment on ourselves in their view.What s worse is that some of the people harassing Dawson aren t the typical cretins that inhabit the alt-right. Mike Cernovich, who s a lawyer, but more well-known for his sexist Internet presence, tweeted: Ugly and has herpes. Maybe an SJW male might actually be able to get at these table scraps. (Doubtful). Paul Joseph Watson, an editor-at-large at Alex Jones  InfoWars, recorded a five-minute YouTube video talking about how vile were the women who were tweeting under the hashtag #ShoutYourStatus for STD Awareness Month. He ended it with the typical sexist attack of: I don t think we should be that surprised that feminists are bragging about their STDs. After all, they re so fat and ugly, the mere fact that they re having any kind of sex at all is a massive achievement. Because the women the alt-right considers to be their eye candy all know their places and would never be so hateful towards men as to become a feminist. Sure.The response to that video caused Dawson to lock her Twitter account, lest Breitbart writers, and other misogynistic writers, embed her tweets in their stories, causing an ever-growing cycle of harassment. A man writing about this stuff would never receive this treatment. Ever.That s what Hillary knows, and has dealt with as a strong woman in a position of power for most of her life. Hillary stood up in Reno and read off Breitbart headlines while many other women are afraid to even mention that cesspool of a news site. Dawson has been a Hillary supporter for years, but her admiration for Hillary went through the roof when she witnessed this speech.Dawson ended her post with a thank-you to Hillary for having the guts (yes, it takes guts to stand up to the hate of the alt-right) to call the alt-right out for what it is. Misogyny, racism, white nationalism, white supremacy, anti-Semitism, and all-around hate are what the alt-right is about. That s despite the fact that, according to Dawson, they delusionally bill themselves as: [A] trendy new generation of conservatism, pushing boundaries and buttons in response to political correctness and liberal oversensitivity. Please. That is vile on its face.Bravo to Dawson for continuing to Internet while female, and bravo to Hillary for standing with her. That is what makes a president.Featured image by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"September 7, 2016",4255
 George Takei BURIES Trump With Perfect Response To Tweet About Jailing Flag Burners,"Donald Trump attacked the First Amendment on Tuesday and George Takei clobbered him for it.Trump called for jailing Americans who burn the flag, and suggested they be stripped of their citizenship as further punishment.Nobody should be allowed to burn the American flag   if they do, there must be consequences   perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 29, 2016Burning the flag is a form of expression that is protected by the Constitution. The Supreme Court has ruled that way twice, and that included support from Justice Antonin Scalia, whom conservatives often hail as a hero.Trump s tweet immediately drew massive condemnation from people on both sides of the aisle. Even Fox legal analyst Andrew Napolitano blasted Trump for his blatantly unconstitutional statement.But Trump also pissed off someone else.George Takei also went after Trump. And his perspective on the subject gives him far more standing on this subject than Trump will ever have.I pledged allegiance to the flag every morning inside an internment camp. I would never burn one, but I d die to protect the right to do so. https://t.co/O5ecSQkyC2  George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) November 29, 2016If anyone had reason to burn a flag it s George Takei. He never did so, but that was his choice. Despite this, he is still defending people who choose to burn it because it s freedom of expression. And Takei actually made another point. There are people who have been mistreated under our flag in this country. Taking away their right to express their anger would only marginalize people and that is not right.Takei wasn t done though. He posted another tweet later reminding Trump that he is responsible for protecting and defending the Constitution now, so he better do his damn job.Mr. Trump, one of your sacred duties as President will be to uphold the Constitution. That means honoring and protecting free speech.  George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) November 29, 2016A lot of people may find the act of burning the flag reprehensible and that s their right. But there are also those who see burning a flag as a message to the government in opposition of a policy or a lack of action to fix an issue. Silencing this form of expression would be tyrannical. If Trump is allowed to take away this form of freedom of speech, nothing stops him from taking away other freedoms as well. At that point, we might as well rip up the Constitution.Featured Image: Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"November 29, 2016",2488
 Lisa Bloom Has FRIGHTENING Warning For The Future Of Roe V. Wade Under Trump (VIDEO),"Donald Trump is a misogynist. We all know that. Now, he and his GOP cronies have the bully pulpit of the federal government from which to systematically dismantle women s right. Of course, this means that the all-important Supreme Court decision, Roe v. Wade, which guarantees the right to choose what to do with one s own body, is at grave risk right now.Ohio has already passed a so-called  heartbeat bill,  in which abortions would be banned should the doctor be able to detect a fetal heartbeat. This can often happen as early as six weeks into a pregnancy   before many women even know they are pregnant. There are no exceptions in this bill for victims of rape and incest, either.Now, women s civil rights lawyer Lisa Bloom is sounding the alarm about just how much trouble we as women could be in under Trump with regards to reproductive care. Bloom says we are in, quote,  Code Red  territory on this one. Here is the video of her appearance on MSNBC s AM Joy regarding this dangerous eventuality:.@LISABLOOM: It's CODE RED in terms of our need to fight to protect women's rights now #heartbeatbill #AMJoy https://t.co/CB5JQsDzJG  AM Joy w/Joy Reid (@amjoyshow) December 11, 2016My fellow women and our awesome allies, the time to fight back is NOW. We cannot afford to be afraid to speak out. We cannot afford to sit on our thumbs. Women s rights are about to be rolled back 100 years under the misogynistic leadership of the Republican Party and Donald Trump. Hopefully, Democrats in the Senate do just what the GOP did to President Obama, and refuse to confirm any judges that do not respect a woman s right to choose. We can also hope that Republican women who are appalled at the treatment of rape and incest victims refuse to confirm these judges as well.We are mightier as a people than these bullies in the federal government. This was a fight that we thought was over, but it is only just beginning. Keep fighting, for the lives of women and girls everywhere depend upon it.Featured image via screen capture from Twitter",News,"December 11, 2016",2037
" Trump’s Shady ‘Charity’ Hurt Children, And This is How","Donald Trump s controversial foundation is once again being exposed for engaging in unsavory practices. Already connected to possible tax evasion and use as a weird piggy bank for Trump and his family, now it is apparent that the Trump Foundation s funds were used to hurt children.The Daily Beast followed the money trail between the Trump Foundation and the anti-vaccination group Generation Rescue, headed by former Playboy model and actress Jenny McCarthy.Donald Trump has not only spread dangerous misinformation about the links between vaccines and autism, but he s also given money to the anti-vaxxer cause.His monetary support for the conspiracy theory came in the form of a $10,000 check to an anti-vaccine charity run by former Playboy model and television host Jenny McCarthy.Trump s monetary and moral support for McCarthy s discredited ideas have real, harmful effects they contribute to the mainstreaming of a conspiracy theory at a time when parents are increasingly deciding to opt out of vaccines despite medical advice.Vaccination is of supreme importance, especially among children who are susceptible to numerous diseases and are often exposed to them in a school environment where they must interact repeatedly with each other. Opposing vaccination and sowing doubt about them harms and kills children. The anti-science, anti-vaccination movement has led to a return of several diseases including whooping cough, which has now killed more children in the last 5 years than it has in a long time.Trump has previously gone on the record with his anti-vaccination views, pushing the idea that they are dangerous, which is absurd as his claim that climate change was a conspiracy created by the Chinese or that Ted Cruz s father was part of the operation to kill President John F. Kennedy.So in addition to the Trump Foundation being used to raise Trump s profile as a donor to charity   with him rarely actually putting any of his own money in   now it is enabling dangerous propaganda that hurts children.Featured image via Flickr/Flickr",News,"October 1, 2016",2056
 Twitter Goes Nuts After President Obama Accomplishes Yet Another First,"Long before becoming President of the United States, Barack Obama was a constitutional law professor, and even before that, he was the editor of the Harvard Law Review. In other words, he knows his way around academic writing, and on Monday, he became the first sitting president to ever publish in an academic journal.Obama s article, called United States Health Care Reform, has a modest byline of  Barack Obama, JD,  for Juris Doctorate. In other words, for all the Republicans accusing the President of arrogance, the President didn t even tout the fact that he s the leader of the free world. It was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, and it stresses the importance of the Affordable Care Act, along with the need to improve on his signature legislation.Twitter loved it. There are few busier people in the world than Barack Obama, yet he finds time to do something no other sitting president has done. That s pretty impressive, as is the impassioned case for improving Obamacare. He even wants to include a public option:Policy makers should build on progress made by the Affordable Care Act by continuing to implement the Health Insurance Marketplaces and delivery system reform, increasing federal financial assistance for Marketplace enrollees, introducing a public plan option in areas lacking individual market competition, and taking actions to reduce prescription drug costs. Although partisanship and special interest opposition remain, experience with the Affordable Care Act demonstrates that positive change is achievable on some of the nation s most complex challenges.Here are just a few of the tweets under the hashtag #ObamaJAMA:President publishes scholarly article.

" Trump Said ‘Ask The Family’ Of A Benghazi Victim About Clinton’s Judgment, So Someone Did"," Be careful what you wish for  is an age-old adage. Earlier this month, Donald Trump tweeted that  if you want to know about Hillary Clinton s honesty and judgement,  all you need to do is  ask the family of Ambassador Chris Stevens,  who died in the horrific terrorist attacks in Benghazi on September 11, 2012.via FreakOutNationOn Tuesday, after the House Benghazi Committee released its report on the attacks   a report that once again exonerated Clinton and confirmed that the numerous hearings are simply a waste of taxpayer dollars aimed at smearing the 2016 Democratic nominee   Ambassador Stevens  sister spoke to the New Yorker about the hearings, and Trump has likely dissolved into a steaming pile of seething rage over her remarks.Dr. Anne Stevens, who serves as her family s spokesperson, made it very clear that no matter what Republicans say, Hillary Clinton is not to blame for Benghazi. In fact, she says the blame lies with Republicans in Congress. It is clear, in hindsight, that the facility was not sufficiently protected by the State Department and the Defense Department. But what was the underlying cause?  she said.  Perhaps if Congress had provided a budget to increase security for all missions around the world, then some of the requests for more security in Libya would have been granted. Certainly the State Department is underbudgeted. Prior to the attacks, the GOP cut embassy security  a move Clinton warned would be detrimental to America s national security  back in 2011:For fiscal 2013, the GOP-controlled House proposed spending $1.934 billion for the State Department s Worldwide Security Protection program   well below the $2.15 billion requested by the Obama administration. House Republicans cut the administration s request for embassy security funding by $128 million in fiscal 2011 and $331 million in fiscal 2012. (Negotiations with the Democrat-controlled Senate restored about $88 million of the administration s request.) Last year, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned that Republicans  proposed cuts to her department would be  detrimental to America s national security    a charge Republicans rejected.[GOP vice presidential nominee Paul] Ryan, [Rep. Darrell] Issa and other House Republicans voted for an amendment in 2009 to cut $1.2 billion from State operations, including funds for 300 more diplomatic security positions. Under Ryan s budget, non-defense discretionary spending, which includes State Department funding, would be slashed nearly 20 percent in 2014, which would translate to more than $400 million in additional cuts to embassy security.Stevens goes on to drop the hammer on any words Republicans want to put in the mouths of her or her family:I do not blame Hillary Clinton or Leon Panetta. They were balancing security efforts at embassies and missions around the world. And their staffs were doing their best to provide what they could with the resources they had. The Benghazi Mission was understaffed. We know that now. But, again, Chris knew that. It wasn t a secret to him. He decided to take the risk to go there. It is not something they did to him. It is something he took on himself.Stevens says that the recently-released report concluded absolutely nothing new, and that Clinton did her best to keep people safe even in spite of fierce opposition from Republicans:She has taken full responsibility, being head of the State Department, for what occurred. She took measures to respond to the review board s recommendations. She established programs for a better security system. But it is never going to be perfect. Part of being a diplomat is being out in the community. We all recognize that there s a risk in serving in a dangerous environment. Chris thought that was very important, and he probably would have done it again. I don t see any usefulness in continuing to criticize her. It is very unjust.Stevens says that the GOP s investigations are nothing but a witch hunt conducted  purely for political reasons. With the many issues in the current election, to use that incident and to use Chris s death as a political point is not appropriate,  she adds, explaining that  everyone did their very best in response to this event.  In fact, her brother had a lot of respect for Clinton and her  ability to intensely read the issues and understand the whole picture. Could this be the final nail in the coffin of the GOP s ridiculous, money-wasting witch hunts? Probably not, unfortunately.Featured image via Getty Images/Justin Sullivan",News,"June 29, 2016",4530
 What Will Rick Snyder Tell Congress About Poisoning The Water Of Flint’s Black Children?,"Michigan governor Rick Snyder is being called to appear before a congressional hearing about how the city of Flint s water supply was poisoned with lead.Snyder, a Republican, made the call on changing the city s source of water in order to save money. As a result, thousands in the mostly black city have been affected.A spokeswoman for the committee did not immediately return a request for comment on the hearing, which would be the first congressional inquiry into the crisis. President Barack Obama signed an emergency designation for Genesee County and Flint last Saturday and the Federal Emergency Management Agency is supplying water and water filters to residents.Lawrence, D-Southfield, a week ago sent a letter to leaders of the committee, of which she is a member, asking for the hearing, saying it s Congress  responsibility to address  a man-made disaster created by the poor policy decisions of elected and career government officials. Snyder s office was pushed by national criticism to release internal emails about how they responded to the water crisis, and though some of those emails were redacted to the point of absurdity, they also reveal that early concerns about the water were downplayed and ridiculed:A top aide to Michigan s governor referred to people raising questions about the quality of Flint s water as an  anti-everything group.  Other critics were accused of turning complaints about water into a  political football.  And worrisome findings about lead by a concerned pediatrician were dismissed as  data,  in quotes.Hillary Clinton dispatched officials from her campaign to go to Michigan to speak to local officials about the water problems, while Senator Bernie Sanders has called for Governor Snyder to resign.While visiting Michigan, President Obama said the damage to the community was  inexplicable and inexcusable. By contrast, Donald Trump refused to speak about the water issue.Featured image via Twitter",News,"January 21, 2016",1950

WILL TRUMP PULL A “ROMNEY” In His First Debate? Says He Won’t Mention Bill’s Infidelities Unless Hillary Does This… [VIDEO],"Who could forget Mitt Romney s second and third debates with Barack Obama? After the first debate, most Americans were pretty sure that Mitt had successfully exposed Barack as the amateur that he is. But something strange and unexpected happened when Mitt came back for round two. Either he was given bad advice, or he just decided he really didn t want to be President after all. Whatever the case, the next two debates for Mitt were abysmal. He clearly rolled over and played dead, while Barack, with the help of his co-debater Candy Crowley, lied to the american people, as Mitt stood by idly and never uttered a single objection. That was the night Mitt passed on the keys to the White House in favor of civility. Sorry America, but civility doesn t work with the Left who has shown a clear pattern of winning at all cost no matter the consequences America is counting on Trump to use every resource available to take down Hillary in the first debate. If Hillary enabled her husband to prey on, rape or to use his position as President of the United States to gain sexual favors in the Oval Office, we expect Trump to bring it up. We also expect him to answer to all of the women who claimed Hillary threatened them if they spoke out against her perve If Hillary really is the champion of women that she claims to be, she should be ready and willing to defend herself. Please Trump, we beg of you  don t pull a  Romney! It s up to Hillary Clinton whether or not the first presidential debate ends up including an exchange over her husband s White House affair with Monica Lewinsky, Republican Donald Trump said Monday night. I don t think I m looking to do that,  Trump told Fox News host Bill O Reilly when asked whether he was planning to bring up the affair   something Trump raised in media interviews during the primaries. I don t know what I m going to do that exactly. It depends on what level she hits you with, if she s fair, if it s unfair,  Trump said.  But certainly I m not looking to do that. Trump, who slashed through his GOP opponents one-by-one in televised debates during the primaries, said he ll decide on the spot whether to launch personal attacks on Hillary Clinton based on whether she treats him with  respect. I have absolutely no idea. I think this. If she treats me with respect, I will treat her with respect. It really depends,  Trump said.Watch here:https://youtu.be/BnLtdAlfuuM People ask me that question,  oh you re going to go out there and do this and that. I really don t know that. You re going to have to feel it out when you re out there. She s got to treat me with respect. I m going to treat her with respect. I d like to start off by saying that because that would be my intention,  he said.One longtime Clinton advisor isn t so sure Trump will unilaterally disarm when it comes to Lewinsky. You can t put it beyond Trump that Monica Lewinsky will play a role in this debate,  former Clinton and White House counsel Greg Craig told Politico in August. She s got to be prepared to deal with the [Clinton] Foundation and Wall Street and super PACs and all of that. They need to be less focused on dealing with his policy proposals and more on dealing with the unexpected. He s going to be in attack mode, probably the whole time,  Craig said.At several stages in the campaign, Trump has brought up Lewinsky, Bill Clinton rape accuser Juanita Broderick, Whitewater, the death of former Clinton aide Vince Foster, and other 90s era scandals and allegations.

 Bundy Militant Vows To Die In Gunfight With Feds: ‘You Guys Are Going To Watch Me Die LIVE’ (VIDEO),"Many of the terrorists who were participating in the armed occupation of a federal bird sanctuary in Oregon turned tail and fled after the FBI arrested their leaders and fellow  freedom fighters, killing the spokesman for the group of heavily-armed right-wing extremists,  Tarp Man  LaVoy Finicum, as he opened fire on law enforcement.Arrested were leaders Ryan and Ammon Bundy, right-wing internet radio host Pete Santilli,  Brian Cavalier, Shawna Cox and Ryan Payne, John Ritzheimer (who had fled home shortly before the crackdown to visit his family), and Joseph O Shaugnessy. Authorities say that everyone but Ryan Bundy and LaVoy Finicum cooperated. Bundy suffered a minor gunshot wound, and Finicum lost his life for his cause   something he recently said he would do rather than allow himself to be arrested.One of those men, an ISIS supporter who joined the Bundy clan as their  resident IT guy, decided to livestream from within the Bundy  militia  compound. David Fry confirmed that children had, indeed, been removed from Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. This is a good thing because of what he said next. Looks like this is it.

 WATCH: This Irish Senator BLASTS His Government For Playing Nice With Fascist Trump,"America will have a fascist in the White House starting on January 20th, and this Irish senator can t believe his own government is accepting that.Despite warnings from experts in the media, historians, and Jews who survived the Holocaust, Americans went to the polls and elected a fascist anyway, disgracing all the soldiers who fought and died during World War II to keep fascism out of America and sweep it out of Europe.After winning, Trump has received congratulation messages from nations around the globe. Some nations have even kissed Trump s ass, which pissed off Irish Senator Aodh n O Riord in to the point where he ripped his government for sucking up to a fascist. America has just elected a fascist and the best thing that the good people in Ireland can do is to ring him up and ask him, is it OK to still bring the shamrock on Saint Patrick s Day? I am embarrassed by the reaction of the Irish government to what has happened in America. I can t believe the reaction from An Taoiseach and from the government. O Riord in then went on a tear listing some of the aspects of fascism. I don t use the term fascist lightly. What else would you call someone who threatens to imprison his political opponents. What else would you call somebody who threatens to not allow people of a certain political faith into their country. What would you say, or what would you call somebody who was threatening to deport 10 million people. He also warned his government that right-wing extremism is rising across Europe and the United States. Can the government not understand what s happening? We are at an ugly international crossroads. What s happening in Britain is appalling. What s happening across Europe is appalling. It has echoes from the 1930s. And America, the most powerful country in the world, has just elected a fascist! He then called for the Minister of Foreign Affairs to explain how Ireland intends to deal with  monster  Trump and said Ireland s support should be conditional like Germany s. Germany and America are connected by values of democracy, freedom and respect for the law and dignity of man,  Angela Merkel said in a message to Trump.  Independent of origin, skin-color, religion, gender, sexual orientation or political views. I offer the next president of the United States close cooperation on the basis of these values.

 Video Shows Whales Swimming That May Change Everything We Know About The BP Oil Spill (VIDEO),"We know that the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill was one of the worst manmade disasters in history. Scientists are still desperately studying the behavior of marine life in the region hoping to find clues as to better understand just how much harm BP caused the ecosystem in 2010.That s why when a video showing a pod of orcas swimming very close to the mouth of the Mississippi River off the coast of Louisiana, scientists started paying attention. Whales have never before been seen swimming in the area. While orcas do enjoy coastal waters, they prefer to stay in colder waters.The video was captured by a fishing group, who sent the footage to local news station WWLTV. Dr, Moby Solangi, who is the President and Executive Director of The Institute for Marine Mammal Studies, told WWLTV: This is really an amazing story that you have told. We have not heard about this before.  Dr. Solangi then on went to say that,  That is concerning, you know. It s when these animals start showing signs of change, we need to pay attention. In the video, which is embedded below, it is mentioned that there was another recent example of large marine life exhibiting bizarre behavior. Just two months ago, a group of young pygmy whales was found beached in Mississippi, hundreds of miles away from their normal habitat.When asked about what role the BP spill may have had in these incidents, Dr. Solangi responded, saying: That certainly disrupted their habitat. There s no question. These are top predators and if they re moving somewhere, something may be going on. What s even more disturbing about this is the revelation that BP is facing very few consequences for the marine armageddon they unleashed. In April, it was reported that BP will have to pay $20 billion dollars in a settlement for the disaster.  Though, since we currently live in an age where corporations can get away with just about anything, BP is able to deduct more than $15 billion dollars of the settlement expenses in tax breaks.Scientists are hard at work trying to figure out what exactly is going on in the Gulf region. This bizarre whale migration may just be the thing that points scientists in the right direction.You can watch the video below.Featured image from video screenshot Featured image from video screenshot",News,"May 27, 2016",2288

CHINESE IMMIGRANT OWES MILLIONS FOR SELLING COUNTERFEIT GOODS IN U.S. GETS Protection From Chinese Banks And U.S. Citizenship,"Counterfeiting is illegal by the way and shouldn t be rewarded with American citizenship This could be the story of an American dream. An immigrant family builds a successful business and buys a four-bedroom house in a quiet neighborhood with good schools for their young son. But not all is as it seems on the steep, curving streets of San Diego s Rancho Penasquitos.A 45-year-old Chinese woman, Xu Ting, lives in a brown shingle house with a weedy driveway. She has been sued for counterfeiting by eight luxury brands, including Gucci and Louis Vuitton, and owes Chanel Inc. $6.9 million in damages. None of this has stopped her from becoming a legal permanent resident of the United States and achieving a comfortable suburban life.China is not the only country with a counterfeiting problem. Most fakes are made in China, but they are sold in America. Counterfeiting is not a priority on par with drug smuggling or money laundering, and is rarely prosecuted as a crime. The lack of legal cooperation with China makes it easy for counterfeiters to move their money beyond the reach of Western law enforcement   and hard to root out counterfeiting kingpins. As long as counterfeiters can stay out of jail and hold on to their profits   and consumers continue to buy   the trade in fakes will likely thrive.Despite spending millions on brand protection, companies often end up playing whack-a-mole, shutting down producers and distributors of fakes, only to see them pop up again. Xu Ting simply refused to show up in court over the years. Instead, doing graduate studies in statistics at San Diego State University, helped her family amass at least $890,000 in bank accounts back in China, and bought the $585,000 Rancho Penasquitos house with her husband, who has also been involved in selling counterfeit luxury goods, public records and court cases in China and the U.S. show. There s a million ways to game the system,  said Dan Plane, an intellectual property lawyer at Simone IP Services in Hong Kong, who is not involved in litigation against Xu Ting.  Probably the only thing that s going to stop her is when she passes away   probably on an island resort somewhere   or if she gets arrested. FINDING XU TINGIn the web of lies that counterfeiters weave   fake names, fake addresses, fake Internet domain registrations   one thing is always true: their bank account information.The need to get paid is the counterfeiter s fatal flaw, and Xu Ting s bank accounts were the first crack in her armor of misdirection.Her legal troubles began in 2008, when a federal judge in California ordered Xu Ting   who declined multiple requests for comment for this story   to pay Chanel Inc. $6.9 million in damages for selling counterfeits online. She still hasn t paid the damages, according to Chanel spokeswoman Kathrin Schurrer. The essential point for Chanel is really shutting down the counterfeiting operations, which we did successfully,  Schurrer wrote in an email.But after the lawsuit, Xu Ting s business continued to grow.In 2009, a Florida judge ruled against Xu Ting and shut down seven websites she was accused of helping run that sold fake Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs and Celine. She did not show up in court.That case didn t stop her either.The next year, Gucci, Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta and Yves Saint Laurent   all brands belonging to France s Kering group   filed a lawsuit in New York federal court against Xu Ting, her future husband, her younger brother, her mother and six others who the companies said sold more than $2 million worth of fake handbags and wallets online to U.S. customers. Gucci alleges that the group shipped merchandise from China to a house in San Diego, where it was repackaged and passed off as genuine.Four days after the suit was filed, Xu Ting married a Chinese man, Xu Lijun, a civil engineer licensed in California who is six years her junior, according to her marriage license issued in the San Diego suburb of El Cajon.Gucci subpoenaed banking records. JP Morgan Chase handed over account records with a wealth of information about the couple: addresses, dates of birth, driver s license, Social Security and passport numbers and a student identification card.In November 2010, Xu Lijun reached a settlement with Gucci   the only defendant to do so. He denied wrongdoing but agreed to let Gucci keep $400,000 in counterfeiting proceeds seized from accounts outside China. He also agreed to pay a $7,500 fine, according to a copy of the judge s order.Eric Siegle, a New York City lawyer who represented Xu Lijun, said he was  a small-time nobody,  and that Gucci s lawsuit, like many others, failed to tackle the real powers behind the operation. The people they are arresting or suing here in the United States are low-level people,  Siegle said.  If you can find where the money is going, you can get to the heart of the problem. It s like the drug wars. Why are we arresting all these kids on street corners? But Gucci, which is seeking $12 million in damages, couldn t find where the money was going because Chinese banks, including the state-run Bank of China, refused to disclose transaction details about the counterfeiters  accounts in China. BOC cannot comply with such orders without violating Chinese law,  the Bank of China said in an email. GREEN CARD? NO PROBLEMXu Ting s legal troubles did not prevent her from getting a green card. In February 2014, she became a legal permanent resident by virtue of being married to someone with an advanced degree or  extraordinary ability,  according to the person familiar with the matter.U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services spokesman Christopher Bentley declined to comment, citing privacy concerns.Dan Kowalski, an immigration attorney and editor of Bender s Immigration Bulletin, said immigration officials may not have known about Xu Ting s legal problems but, more likely, didn t consider them disqualifying. Grounds for denying a green card range from committing a serious crime to having communicable disease but there s nothing about civil liabilities.  A vaguer requirement for  good moral character  is more commonly applied for citizenship, not legal residence.In the U.S., most counterfeiting prosecutions are civil cases brought by companies seeking to shut down websites selling fakes and get financial compensation. Criminal cases, which lawyers say are a far more effective deterrent, are rare. A person is more likely to be struck by lightning than imprisoned for counterfeiting,  said Geoffrey Potter, an intellectual property lawyer at New York s Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler.In an email, Justice Department spokesman Peter Carr said,  Large-scale commercial counterfeiting is one of the top enforcement priorities of the department s Intellectual Property Task Force, which continues to have a number of significant prosecutions. The Department of Homeland Security seized $1.2 billion worth of fakes at U.S. borders last year, but the Justice Department filed just 91 criminal cases for selling counterfeit goods and services in fiscal year 2014. By comparison, the Justice Department filed 22,530 cases for immigration violations, 12,184 cases for drug-related offenses and 12,509 violent crime cases during the same period.The National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center, a multiagency group led by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, reports slightly more counterfeit-related crime   683 arrests, 454 indictments, 461 convictions in the 2014 fiscal year   because its tally includes local prosecutions and counterfeit-related activity, like wire fraud.Decisions about whether to prosecute criminally typically start with a U.S. attorney s office, whose priorities vary by district, said Bruce Foucart, director of the multiagency group. Some may give weight to the volume of faked goods, others to the suspect s history. If the U.S. attorney s office declines a case, investigators try to persuade local prosecutors.China is the largest source country for seized counterfeit goods, and apparel and accessories are the largest category of merchandise. Foucart, who didn t know about Xu Ting, said luxury goods are typically made in Guangzhou and sent by container or courier like FedEx to the U.S. They may be sold in stores or flea markets but are usually hawked online. Unfortunately, once you shut one (website) down, they have 10 more ready to open up in a different name,  said Foucart.Brand owners also bear responsibility. Government agencies often rely on them for tips and investigative legwork.U.S. law gives companies broad powers to enforce court judgments. Unpaid judgments accrue interest and last for 20 years, said Potter, the intellectual property lawyer. Even a bankruptcy won t erase the debt.  The counterfeiter can t own a business, buy a house, have a bank account or borrow money from a bank,  Potter said.  If the counterfeiter takes a regular job, the judgment holder can garnish her wages. But doing the kind of work required to root out debtors like Xu Ting   public records searches to see whether they own real estate, subpoenaing credit card bills to track spending habits, hiring investigators to determine whether they have jobs   takes relentless commitment, and money.Via: AP ",Government News,"Jul 11, 2015",9259

 White Racists Are FURIOUS With Netflix; The Poor Little Snowflakes Are Even Boycotting,"If it weren t for the whiney phrase,  political correctness,  which is really just another phrase for being polite, Donald Trump would likely have never invaded the White House. It seems that over the last 50 or so years, black people have gotten much too uppity, so when Netflix announced the release of a series called Dear White People, which isn t supposed to be exactly flattering to white people and especially racist white people, they threw a fit and are canceling their Netflix memberships.Because they can be as cruel as they want toward People of Color, but if the People of Color call them on it, well, that s out of bounds. So, White Supremacists, taking a cue from their Supreme Orange Leader, came up with a protest Twitter hashtag, #NoNetflix.Netflix announced a new anti-white show (Dear White People) that promotes white genocide.I cancelled my account, do the same. #NoNetflix pic.twitter.com/2HIGqviLHj  Shia LeBaked  (@bakedalaska) February 8, 2017This is the type of anti-white bigotry that gets incited by @Netflix sponsored shows. #NoNetflix pic.twitter.com/gaozYZ6kyO  Shia LeBaked  (@bakedalaska) February 10, 2017Netflix is working with Code Red Production, peddling their anti-White garbage. #NoNetflix #BoycottNetflix pic.twitter.com/ZutCzDus0L  Boatsinker (@Clausfarre143) February 11, 2017To be fair, this is one of the show s writers, but after reading these tweets, I too hate white people and like Moore, I m one of them.Why I canceled my membership @netflix #NoNetflix pic.twitter.com/vQspcNM5Mi  trevr (@trevrc) February 9, 2017If you can stomach it, read this trash:retweet and like if you think this guy summed it up beautifully. #netflix #NoNetflix pic.twitter.com/Xf8OVC24Uk  Dwight Mann (@geno_philia) February 9, 2017Netflix.

 Even Trump’s New Campaign Manager Demanded He Release His Taxes (VIDEO),"The problem with running for President in the 21st Century is that nearly everyone has a Google page or 1,000 about them, and often, video to back it up. That s the case with Kellyanne Conway, who was named Donald Trump s new campaign manager in his second attempt to shake things up.In April, Conway appeared on CNN, where host Don Lemon asked her about an  alliance  between John Kasich and Ted Cruz. Conway, who wasn t working for Trump, or apparently even supporting Trump, at the time, thought the alliance was fine, but Trump s refusal to release his taxes wasn t.Then head of a super-PAC supporting Trump rival Ted Cruz, Conway was asked in an April 25 CNN interview if the  alliance  between John Kasich and Ted Cruz was fair.  Of course it s fair game,  she said.  Oh absolutely. It s completely transparent. Donald Trump s tax returns aren t, and I would like to see those be transparent.

She also sharply critiqued the businessman in the past over Trump University, his use of personal insults, and simply  saying things that aren t true,  the left-leaning group said.Source: The HillIn other words, it s becoming increasingly clear that Trump surrogates souls can be bought and sold, although it s not clear for how much.

I never thought to stay here without papers. I had a visa, I traveled every few months back to the country to Slovenia to stamp the visa. I came back, I applied for the green card, I applied for the citizenship later on after many years of green card. So I went by system, I went by the law. And you should do that, you should not just say let me stay here and whatever happens, happens. Trump, who immigrated to the United States from Slovenia in 1996, said that she and her husband are  prepared  for people to call him names for expressing his viewpoints.  I m a full-time mom, and I love it. So, I decided not to be in the campaign so much, but I support my husband 100 percent,  she said of her role in the campaign itself. We have thick skin, and we know that people will judge him and people will call names. They don t give him enough credit.

 Senate Democrats Launch A Filibuster Over Gun Reform (Live Video),"As Republicans stall any talks relating to gun reform or gun violence, Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy, who served at the time of the Sandy Hook tragedy, has taken to the floor of the Senate where a filibuster will be in place until the Republicans abandon their cowardice and do the right thing.Vowing to continue talking until something is done, Senator Murphy plainly put it:  I m at my wits end. I ve had enough. I ve stood on this floor dozens of times talking about this subject. Now often I come down to the tell the stories of the voices, the victims, of these gun homicides and these mass shootings, just to make sure everyone here knows who these people are. They are real people, with families. And so this isn t new to me, but I m at my wits end. I ve had enough. I ve had enough of the ongoing slaughter of innocence, and I ve had enough of inaction in this body. Interrupting consideration of the Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations Act, Murphy demanded that Senate Republicans take up a clean cut vote on closing the gun show loophole, and banning people on terrorist watch lists.Joining Senator Murphy was New Jersey Democrat Cory Booker, who pledged Democrats would hold the Senate floor until action is taken. Already two hours in, Democrats will not be budging.Senator Murphy s spokesman Chris Harris told reporters: Until private sales at gun shows and over the internet also require stringent background checks and unless suspected terrorists on the no fly list are prohibited from legally purchasing guns, our lax gun laws will continue to allow terrorists and criminals to amass a weapons stockpile. Sen. Murphy will remain on the floor demanding the Senate adopt these measures. Of course, Republicans chided Senator Murphy over the use of a filibuster, accusing him of delaying important voting matters. Before the start of the filibuster, Senate Democrats slipped in a provision in the Appropriations Act to ban watchlist suspects from buying a gun, and Republicans have accused Murphy of obstructing his own end-game.Who wants to bet Republicans would have blocked that appropriations bill because of the provision?Watch the filibuster, live stream, here:Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"June 15, 2016",2236

Daniel Llorente is the brave pro-American Cuban dissident who interrupted Monday s May Day parade in Havana, running in front of the marching throngs waving an American flag. A communist mob attacked him, beating him and dragging him away.The man, identified as Daniel Llorente, has previously waged similar protests against the communist regime of dictator Ra l Castro and has expressed vocally his support for the American government.Video of the incident shows that Llorente took off running in front of the throngs, waving an American flag before the likeness of mass murderer Ernesto  Che  Guevara in the Plaza of the Revolution, waiting to march just moments before the May Day parade was to begin, shouting anti-government slogans. A group of men waiting on the sidelines, who have not been identified in reports, restrained, beat, and dragged Llorente away. Every major Cuban government leader, including dictator Castro, was in attendance.The Miami-based outlet Mart  Noticias identified the man as Llorente, a freelance cab driver and dissident, but does not belong to any dissident organizations. Instead, he has used his American flag to protest on previous occasions by waving it before public congregations. A year ago, Llorente protested before a crowd awaiting the first American cruise ship s arrival in Havana, the Adonia. Llorente greeted the ship waving an American flag and shouting  Yes we can! , the famous slogan of President Barack Obama s first presidential campaign. The government organized a rabble to berate Llorente with racial epithets, and Llorente responded by asserting his freedom.Read more: Breitbart",Government News,"May 2, 2017",2015
 The Internet Isn’t Buying GOP Chair’s Blasting Of David Duke (TWEETS),"Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke is so enthralled with Donald Trump that he s been inspired to run for the Senate, but the Republican Party supposedly isn t having it. GOP chairman Reince Preibus finally said something about it, which, in and of itself is weird because Duke announced this a day ago:This is ridiculous on its face because Priebus chairs the party that nominated Donald Trump, and Donald Trump attracts white supremacists like iron filings to a rare earth magnet. Priebus might think he s telling the world that the GOP isn t made up of a bunch of bigoted hypocrites, but the Internet sees right through him. They raked Priebus over coals so hot that, if Satan were real, he d be insane with jealousy.        Indeed, Priebus is quite proud of the GOP s decision to nominate Trump, as evidenced by posts on his official Facebook page. It s only a little over the top, given how he allegedly feels about racists who spread their hate like David Duke:While Trump does denounce white supremacists to appease the press, he s always retweeting them. Also, Richard Spencer, a prominent white supremacist, pointed out that Trump must think like them, because otherwise they wouldn t be so drawn to him. They see something in his rhetoric to which the GOP s leaders have turned a completely blind eye.Priebus doesn t know this? Hard to believe. He s as transparent as clear mountain air. The GOP is officially the party of white supremacists, and his token repudiation of David Duke is way too little, way too late.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"July 23, 2016",1570

Clapper and Gen. Mike Flynn have a history that s not so perfect:Two years ago, I was called into a meeting with the undersecretary of defense for intelligence and the director of national intelligence, and after some  niceties,  I was told by the USDI that I was being let go from DIA. It was definitely an uncomfortable moment (I suspect more for them than me).I asked the DNI (Gen. James Clapper) if my leadership of the agency was in question and he said it was not; had it been, he said, they would have relieved me on the spot.I knew then it had more to do with the stand I took on radical Islamism and the expansion of al Qaeda and its associated movements. I felt the intel system was way too politicized, especially in the Defense Department. After being fired, I left the meeting thinking,  Here we are in the middle of a war, I had a significant amount of combat experience (nearly five years) against this determined enemy on the battlefield and served at senior levels, and here it was, the bureaucracy was letting me go.

 Trump’s Approval Rating Takes Game-Changing Turn In 11 Pro-Trump States (DETAILS),"Donald Trump s approval rating continues to plummet in its downward spiral, and it seems to be getting lower by the week. The latest bad news for the man baby in the White House will be that more Americans disapprove of Trump s job performance than approve in 31 states across the country. Here s the real kicker   this includes 11 states that he d actually won in November!It turns out, not even Trump s most supportive audiences are willing to stand by him after watching him try to burn our country to the ground on a weekly basis. The states that have changed their minds about Trump include Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan and Florida, Ohio, Iowa, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona   and two states that shocked everyone   Indiana and Texas.You can check out how the states are rating Trump below:Trump has been setting records left and right during his presidency   and almost 100% of it is negative. Over the last three months, Gallup noted that the disgraceful POTUS  approval rating (39 percent) has set records lows for a president in his second quarter.When many of those states might have supported Trump last year, it seems they re running in the opposite direction now. In Texas and Indiana, there is now a major difference between the states  approval of Trump in November, and how the American people feel about him now. For example, in Indiana (where Vice President Mike Pence hails from), Trump had won that state by 19 points in November. Less than a year later, he is now one point underwater. In Texas, Trump had won by nine points last year. Now, he s nine points under in that state.This is not looking good for Trump at all, as he is consistently failing in each of these once pro-Trump states:What this tells us is that even Trump s supporters are getting tired of his bullsh*t and are regretful that they didn t put their vote behind a real presidential candidate. Any Republican who wanted to give Trump the benefit of the doubt is certainly having second thoughts now.To a normal leader, this would be devastating. Any respectable president would be panicking and consumed with how they are going to turn this around. But not Trump! Last week, Trump said that his ridiculously low approval rating of almost 40 percent was  not bad at this time    even though he d set a record low.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"July 26, 2017",2353
SENATOR MIKE LEE Nails It On Why The Senate Opposes A Supreme Court Nominee [Video],"Senator Mike Lee gives it right back to FOX s Martha MacCallum when she grilled him on why the Senate won t accept a Supreme Court nominee: MARTHA MACCALLUM (HOST): The president has laid out I think what anyone would say is a very fair set of circumstances for nominating someone, so why not give this person hearing?SEN. MIKE LEE (R-UT): OK that all sounds great. We do have to remember Martha, we re talking about a lame duck president in his final months of office who is talking about making a lifetime appointment to the highest court in the land, a court which in recent years has played an increasingly large role in the development of public policy. And we think the American people have a voice, that voice should be heard and the American people ought to be able to choose their next president and have the next president, whether that s a Republican or Democrat, make the choice.MACCALLUM: Yeah but I think, senator, with all due respect, wouldn t the American people say we elected President Obama? We also elected the senators who are currently in office, and we expect them both, on both sides to do their job. The president s job is to name a nominee, your job is to give that person a hearing and either appoint or not. Either consent, to give consent, or not. So why not go through the process? Why do you get to decide that?LEE: You re absolutely right that elections have consequences. President Obama was elected again as president in 2012. Senate elections also have consequences and when Republicans were elected to the majority in the Senate after the 2014 elections, we had an increasingly large role to play in the system. Now you re also absolutely right, the president has the right to nominate. That is his prerogative. It s also the Senate s right to decide when, whether, how, to what extent, to confirm someone and here what we re saying is, we think that it s very important to maintain a tradition, a tradition that goes all the way back to 1888 by the way. 1888 was the last time you had a Supreme Court vacancy arise during a presidential election year, and the last time that that vacancy arising during the presidential election year was filled during the same year, and confirmed by a Senate that was run by a party opposite the president s party.MACCALLUM: I think everybody listens to that and understands what you are saying and that there s   but I don t think that gets around the basic requirement to do the job, to go through the process and if you all decide that you don t want to give consent to that person, well that s absolutely your right. And just given your background and being such an adherent to the Constitution, it seems somewhat surprising I think to some people to take that attitude. And it also feeds in perhaps to the notion that people in your position don t want to   are blocking things from happening on Capitol Hill.LEE: We are blocking this from happening, make no mistake about it. We are blocking this one. And we feel it s our obligation to do so. We think that especially with this president who has overstepped his constitutional boundaries so many times   [CROSSTALK]MACCALLUM: But then why does it make it right on to do that on your side? You can look at this person and say  no thank you, we don t like this person,  but why the hesitation to have a hearing? To do the process? I think that s what people have a hard time understanding.Via: Media Matters",politics,"Feb 24, 2016",3434
 Cowardly GOP Rep. Files Police Complaint Against SENIORS Because He’s TERRIFIED Of Dissent,"Republican members of Congress, who love claiming that they re the only party that stands for real Americans, are now terrified of their own constituents. This is happening for one simple reason   they never expected their own constituents to be angry with what they re doing on Capitol Hill. So instead of facing the music and admitting that the entire GOP platform is something Americans don t want, they re running scared.Such is the case with Idaho representative Raul Labrador. His office had the audacity to file a complaint against a group of people made up primarily of senior citizens because they were showing up at his office in Lewiston on a weekly basis to voice their displeasure with him and the GOP. Labrador obviously considers this a threat, and perhaps, if they d threatened violence it would be.But that s not what s happening. Chris Ankeny, the chief of police in Lewiston, the Idaho town where this is taking place, says these people were protesting in front of Labrador s offices and that no crimes had been committed. Employees are uncomfortable with them because of the national attention this group had garnered, not because of credible (or even in-credible) threats.Labrador s office contacted the D.C. Capitol Police over this because that force has jurisdiction over U.S. Congresspeople s offices in addition to Capitol Hill. They did so because they felt the Lewiston department wasn t doing anything. The thing is, a good police department won t do anything when they confirm that there s no crime happening (including threats). So what this is is an office full of people who can t handle dissent.The worst part is that this group has so many seniors, and Labrador won t hear them. These are people who may be worried about cuts to programs they depend on, including Medicare and Meals on Wheels. Others living in and around Lewiston are worried about climate change and clean energy. They say Labrador s absence from his offices is a sign of cowardice, and they re not wrong. He is a coward.Many Republicans have run away and hidden from their constituents lately because they can t tolerate the fact that their constituents  concerns run counter to the GOP s platform. They re too used to putting party above country. Maybe this is uncharted territory for them, but shouldn t these guys, who work for the very people they re pissing off, actually stop to listen?Or are they not what they ve been trying to sell to us?It s really disgusting that Labrador s office feels so threatened by non-violent, non-threatening protests from senior citizens that they ve had to file a complaint.Featured image by Gage Skidmore.

 McDonald’s Future Is Scary: Bottomless Fries And Automated Cashiers,"McDonald s in recent years has become an icon of gluttony and corporate greed, from the fight for NYC McDonald s workers to receive a $15 minimum wage, to the obesity epidemic, which still remains rampant throughout the country. Morgan Spurlock s 2004 documentary, Supersize Me, exposed to the public just how awful McDonald s food is for the human body, and how McDonald s manipulates consumers into thinking otherwise. Over the course of my McDiet, I consumed 30 pounds of sugar from their food. That s a pound a day. On top of that, I also took in 12 pounds of fat,  said Mr. Spurlock in the documentary.  Now, I know what you re saying. You re saying nobody s supposed to eat this food three times a day. No wonder all this stuff happened to you. But the scary part is: there are people who eat this food regularly. Some people even eat it every day. So, while my experiment may have been a little extreme, it s not that crazy. But here is a crazy idea: Why not do away with your Super Size options? Who needs 42 ounces of Coke? A half pound of fries? And why not give me a choice besides french fries or french fries? That would be a great start. But why should these companies want to change? Their loyalty isn t to you, it s to the stockholders. The bottom line: They re a business, no matter what they say. And by selling you unhealthy food, they make millions. And no company wants to stop doing that. If this ever-growing paradigm is going to shift, it s up to you. But if you decide to keep living this way, go ahead. Over time, you may find yourself getting as sick as I did. After the documentary was released, McDonald s removed their  supersize  option, but continued to develop very unhealthy menu items. Rather than adapt to the progressive reforms and changing cultural landscape in America, McDonald s has the audacity to fight back. In July, the company is opening up a new restaurant in Missouri with Automated Kiosk Cashiers to phase out several workers from employment. The restaurant, often an only resort for low income Americans for food, is also offering bottomless French fries.The company is spending $1.59 million on the new restaurant to resemble fine dining. Today s customers seek a comfortable and inviting atmosphere,  the owner of the franchise restaurant, Chris Habiger, told the St Joseph News-Press.  So we re committed to providing a modern look and feel to this restaurant.  Mr. Habiger owns six other McDonald s franchise restaurants, which requires non-borrowed resources of $500,000 to even be considered by McDonald s to own a single franchise.While McDonald s workers across the United States have been fighting to earn a livable wage, in 2015 McDonald s CEO more than tripled his salary from $1.69 million in 2014 to $7.91 million in 2015; a 368 percent raise.Featured image via Flickr",News,"April 18, 2016",2832
DOJ’s JEFF SESSIONS Opens Investigation Into What The FBI Told The FISA Court About The “Fake” Dossier To Get Warrants,"Thank goodnesss Jeff Sessions is moving on finding out what went on behind the scenes to acquire FISA warrants. In other words, what was NOT said in order to get the judge to approve the FISA warrant to spy:We can start with why law enforcement officials who submitted the application failed to note that the Clinton campaign and DNC funded the dossier. The application does note that the dossier was put together by a  U.S. person  with political motivations, but Republicans have argued that the application should have been more specific.Via Daily Caller: Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Sunday that the Department of Justice is investigating whether the FBI submitted accurate information about the infamous Steele dossier in order to obtain a surveillance warrant against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. Are you, sir, investigating the fact that the FBI used the dossier to get a wiretap against Trump associates and they did not tell the FISA court that the Democrats and Hillary Clinton paid for the dossier?  Maria Bartiromo, the host of Fox News   Sunday Morning Futures,  asked Sessions.

" This One Factor Determines If You’re A Trump Supporter, And It’s Not What You Think","Trump supporters have a lot in common. They lack education. They re a bunch of horrible racists. They want to  make America great again  by viciously beating African-American protesters and homeless people. The idea of keeping brown people out of  Murika appeals to them. His appeal to racists is so great that white supremacists are actively campaigning for him and terrorist groups are using his hate speech to recruit. But did you know that one factor you haven t thought of defines Trump support better than jingoism, racism, homophobia, extreme anti-Muslim sentiments, or a desire to build a gigantic wall so we never have to even look at a Hispanic person again?Politico s Matthew MacWilliams says he has discovered one factor that predicts whether or not someone is a Trump voter:In fact, I ve found a single statistically significant variable predicts whether a voter supports Trump and it s not race, income or education levels: It s authoritarianism.That s right, Trump s electoral strength and his staying power have been buoyed, above all, by Americans with authoritarian inclinations. And because of the prevalence of authoritarians in the American electorate, among Democrats as well as Republicans, it s very possible that Trump s fan base will continue to grow.MacWilliams just finished conducting a national poll which sampled 1,800 voters across the nation.  I found that education, income, gender, age, ideology and religiosity had no significant bearing on a Republican voter s preferred candidate,  he writes.  Only two of the variables I looked at were statistically significant: authoritarianism, followed by fear of terrorism, though the former was far more significant than the latter. MacWilliams explains that Trump s pledge to make  America great again  as well as his horrific suggestions that Muslims be banned from the United States, wear special ID badges if they re already here, and be rounded up into concentration camps (as well, of course, as his Great Wall of Murika), all cater to authoritarian inclinations:Authoritarianism is not a new, untested concept in the American electorate. Since the rise of Nazi Germany, it has been one of the most widely studied ideas in social science. While its causes are still debated, the political behavior of authoritarians is not. Authoritarians obey. They rally to and follow strong leaders. And they respond aggressively to outsiders, especially when they feel threatened.This, of course, describes Trump supporters perfectly. Frighteningly, authoritarianism (while prevalent among Republicans) is not limited to the Right. In the 2008 Democratic primary, the political scientist Marc Hetherington found that authoritarianism mattered more than income, ideology, gender, age and education in predicting whether voters preferred Hillary Clinton over Barack Obama,  MacWilliams notes.  But Hetherington has also found, based on 14 years of polling, that authoritarians have steadily moved from the Democratic to the Republican Party over time  since they began to embrace civil rights, gay rights, and other hallmarks of liberalism that are common in the party today.MacWilliams notes that authoritarianism is not  a statistically significant factor in the Democratic primary race  thus far, but  it does appear to be playing an important role on the Republican side,  as 49 percent of Republicans score  in the top quarter of the authoritarian scale. MacWilliams  poll asked voters some simple questions about parenting to gauge authoritarianism:  whether it is more important for the voter to have a child who is respectful or independent; obedient or self-reliant; well-behaved or considerate; and well-mannered or curious. Based on these questions, Trump was the only candidate Republican or Democrat whose support among authoritarians was statistically significant,  he concludes. This, combined with the 52% of respondents who live in fear of a terrorist attack on U.S. soil, gives us something to fear. While it s easy to say President Trump  can t happen here    that Americans won t stand for the ideological reincarnation of Adolf Hitler being elected   MacWilliams points out that it s time that Democrats and all who oppose fascism begin taking Trump seriously.Featured image via Gage Skidmore/Flickr",News,"January 17, 2016",4289
SAY WHAT? AMAZON TELLS CUSTOMER THEY WERE FORCED BY FEDERAL GOVERNMENT To Remove Confederate Flag From Website,"When it comes to limiting our free speech, nothing this lawless government does should surprise us. Under  normal  circumstances, I would question the validity of this claim, but we are no longer living under  normal  circumstances Amazon.com staff are telling irate customers that the company was ordered by the federal government not to sell items featuring the Confederate flag in the aftermath of the Charleston shooting.Amazon made the announcement this week, along with eBay, Sears and Walmart, that it would no longer sell products bearing the rebel flag, but according to a conversation posted on YouTube between a customer and an Amazon sales rep, the decision could have been made as a result of pressure from the government.At first the Amazon staffer claims that the items were banned because they were deemed to be offensive, but when pressed by the customer, the sales rep tells a different story. Is this a political statement by Amazon.com or is this a directive that you re following, that the government said you know we want you guys not to sell these anymore?  asks the caller. The government is not allowing us to sell this Confederate flag,  responds the staffer. So the government is not allowing you .to sell it?  asks the caller, to which the sales rep responds,  yes. So Amazon is not making a political statement, this is something the government told you to do?  questions the caller. Exactly,  responds the staffer.Via: InfoWars",politics,"Jun 25, 2015",1457
 Hawaii Republicans Punish Female Party Leader For Criticizing Trump At Women’s March,"Republicans in Hawaii punished the first female House Minority Leader for putting country before party.Prior to and after the election, state Rep. Beth Fukumoto took a stand against Donald Trump. She criticized him for his treatment of women and minorities and refused to blindly follow Trump.Criticism is a form of free speech, but Fukumoto is now being punished for exercising her constitutional rights by her own party.Fukumoto served as the House Minority Leader of the Republican Party in the state legislature, but no longer holds that position after her party punished her for criticizing Trump at the Women s March last month. They told me they would keep me in this position if I would commit to not disagreeing with our president for the remainder of his term,  Fukumoto explained during a speech on the House floor.  Mr. Speaker, I m being removed because I refused to make that commitment, because I believe it s our job as Americans and as leaders in this body to criticize power when power is wrong. Indeed, dissent is an American value, especially when the president is acting like petulant child tyrant.Fukumoto was told by a Republican colleague that as House Minority Leader, her first duty should be to the party. You are speaking not for yourself anymore,  Rep. Bob McDermott responded.  It is a high-level responsibility. And he is totally wrong.The first duty of any American in public office is to the country and the people, not the interests of the party. Putting party and power first is selfish and blinds lawmakers to seeing what is best for the nation.McDermott repeatedly argued with other Republican women in the state legislature and Fukumoto was replaced as House Minority Leader by a male lawmaker.Fukumoto told KHON that she expressed her concerns about Trump during the Women s March the day after the inauguration. The Republican Party is getting increasingly hostile to different opinions. If you followed what happened at the state convention, I got booed for about 10 minutes straight for raising concerns about President Trump, then nominee Trump, and the way he treated women and minorities in many of his remarks. I, at the time, had said this is not, this should not reflect our party I repeated those sentiments at the Women s March last week.And since then, there have been many calls for my resignation, and my caucus members have raised concerns about whether or not that means I m a Republican, whether or not that means I m fit for leadership, whether or not that means I should even be an elected official. My caucus has asked me to stop speaking out about Trump and to make a commitment. They ve said they ll keep me as minority leader if I make a commitment not to speak out against Trump for the remainder of his term. I don t think that s our job as elected officials, even more so, I don t think that s our job as citizens. So Fukumoto is now reaching out to her constituents asking them if they would be okay with her joining the Democratic Party.Here s the video via KHON.Fukumoto should not have been punished for criticizing Donald Trump. But Republicans increasingly believe that anyone who criticizes them and their policies should be punished, the Constitution be damned.The fact that Republicans replaced Fukumoto with a man speaks volumes about how much Republicans value women and it s an insult that should be answered with protests and a landslide victory for Democrats at the ballot box for generations until Republican learn to respect women, the country, and the Constitution that they claim to hold so dear.Featured Image: YouTube",News,"February 2, 2017",3602
EGYPTIAN COURT SENTENCES MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD LEADER AND 13 OTHERS TO DEATH AND LEADER’S “Peaceful” U.S.-Egyptian Brother To Life In Prison,"But wait wasn t the Muslim Brotherhood s Arab Spring (Sharia Law for all Egyptians) supposed to be a good thing? An Egyptian court sentenced Mohamed Badie, leader of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, and 13 other senior members of the group to death for inciting chaos and violence, and gave a life term to a U.S.-Egyptian citizen for ties to the Brotherhood.The men were among thousands of people detained after freely elected Islamist president Mohamed Mursi was toppled in 2013 by the military under Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who is now president.Sisi describes the Brotherhood as a major security threat. The group says it is committed to peaceful activism and had nothing to do with Islamist militant violence in Egypt since Mursi s fall following mass protests against his rule.Egypt s mass trials of Brotherhood members and people accused of links to the group, as well as its tough crackdown on Islamist and liberal opposition alike, have drawn international criticism of its judicial system and human rights record.The sentences, pronounced at a televised court session on Saturday, can be appealed before Egypt s highest civilian court in a process that could take years to reach a final verdict.U.S.-Egyptian citizen Mohamed Soltan was sentenced to life in jail for supporting the veteran Islamist movement and transmitting false news. He is the son of Brotherhood preacher Salah Soltan, who was among those sentenced to death.Mohamed Abdel-Mawgod, one of the defense lawyers, condemned the verdicts.  The court did not differentiate between the defendants and put them all in the same basket,  he told reporters at the courthouse. None of the defendants were present during the hearing.Badie is the Brotherhood s General Guide and has already been sentenced to several death and life sentences. His deputy Khairat El-Shater was given a life sentence on Saturday. OPERATIONS ROOM  TRIALRights groups say Egypt, where a popular uprising toppled veteran autocrat Hosni Mubarak in 2011 and started years of political turmoil, is now cracking down on all dissent. Sisi says stability is needed to revive the shattered economy.Rights advocates have criticized a U.S. decision to end a freeze on military aid to Cairo, saying Washington is putting human rights on the backburner. The United States has said the decision to end the freeze was in the interest of national security.Mohamed Soltan, 27, arrested in August 2013, had been on hunger strike while in prison. He deserves the punishment because of the money and instructions from the Brotherhood which were found with him, and for spreading chaos and horror in society,  presiding Judge Mohamed Nagi Shehata told reporters.Sara Mohamed, a relative of the Soltan family, said they would appeal the verdict.  It was a farce trial of the first class None of the defendants attended the session,  she told Reuters by phone.A website calling for Mohamed Soltan s release says he was not a member of the Brotherhood, describing him as a U.S.-educated peace activist who was involved in youth events and charities. The website shows pictures of him lying emaciated on a stretcher while in detention.Saturday s case was known in local media as  The Rabaa Operations Room  trial. This is in reference to a sit-in at Rabaa square in 2013 in which hundreds of people protesting at the overthrow of Mursi were killed when security forces tried to clear the area by force.Cairo has defended its actions, saying it had given protesters the opportunity to leave peacefully and that armed elements within the Brotherhood initiated the violence.Saturday s session sentenced 51 people. Those who were not sentenced to death were given a life sentence. The long list of charges included leading and funding an outlawed group, overturning the constitution and planning to spread chaos, a court source said.Via: Reuters",left-news,"Apr 11, 2015",3855

Obama Joins Comedy Central Host to Push ‘Laughable’ Establishment Conspiracy Theory on DNC Leaks,"21st Century Wire says President Obama is once again appearing on  info-tainment  programming on Comedy Central but his appearance is clearly not to entertain or inform the viewer. In the final days of the President s time in office he is going on comedy shows to push the  Russian hack  effect on the U.S. Presidential election outcome. He does so without a shred of evidence nor a mention of the Podesta emails, the collusion of the media with the Clinton campaign or the questionable practices of the Clinton Foundation.The Duran asks some good questions and provides further analysis  Alex Christoforou The DuranObama has gone all in to blame Russia for Hillary Clinton s loss and the DNC hack that exposed Hillary Clinton for the corrupt cheat that we all knew, deep down inside, she truly was.Notice how Obama talks only about the DNC hack and not the Wikileaks Podesta email leak. Also notice how Obama tries to justify his conveniently timed call for an investigation, by throwing it back onto Donald Trump.Obama never states that he has irrefutable evidence that Russia hacked the DNC emails, and never even mentions once the Podesta emails We determined and announced in October that it was the consensus of all the Intelligence agencies in law enforcement that organizations affiliated with Russian intelligence were responsible for the hacking of the DNC materials that were being leaked. FYI China, Israel, Germany, etc  also hack US institutions. US intelligence agencies hack governments all over the world.Obama s above assertions are based on James Clapper s statement that The Duran reported on in October consider the statement US intelligence published last week on the subject of alleged Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee and of other US agencies involved in the election. It reads as follows: The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations. The recent disclosures of alleged hacked e-mails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. Such activity is not new to Moscow the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there.We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities. (bold italics added)The statement is an implicit admission that US intelligence has no evidence to back its allegations of Russian hacking.It is merely  confident    not  sure    that it is the Russians who are behind the hacking, and it is clear from the statement that it arrived at this conclusion purely through inference: because the hacks supposedly were  consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts .US intelligence assumes the Russians were behind the hack not because it knows this to be so but in part because of what it believes Russian motives to be.The statement backs its claim with a textual trick.  It says  the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia .  It then immediately follows these words with the words  for example .These lead to the expectation that an actual example of such Russian  tactics and techniques  is about to follow. Instead what is provided are the fact free words  to influence public opinion there .The words  for example  lend nothing to the meaning of the statement, which would be exactly the same without them.  These two words as used in the statement are actually meaningless.   That is a sure sign that their presence in the statement is intended to confuse the casual reader, and that this is true of the statement as a whole.The words are designed to create a subliminal impression to a casual reader that the Russians have been caught doing this sort of thing before, without however providing a single actual example when this was the case.Demonstrating how thin the case of Russian government actually is, the statement then goes on to say: Some states have also recently seen scanning and probing of their election-related systems, which in most cases originated from servers operated by a Russian company. However, we are not now in a position to attribute this activity to the Russian Government. (bold italics added)In other words US intelligence admits the mere fact servers operated by a Russian company may have been used for  scanning and probing    and presumably also for hacking   is not in itself proof of the involvement of the Russian government.The Daily Show s Trevor Noah, who is not a journalist, and not even American, is the perfect useful idiot to conduct this interview and help spread Obama s political spin.No tough question, no follow up questions just giggly gushing glances of admiration and awe from Noah.Remember when Obama told Trump to  stop whining  about a rigged election and focus on  getting votes. This was when Obama, and the entire Hillary liberal elite establishment, were certain that Trump had no chance to win the US Presidency.How things change, and how Obama is now changing his tune doing everything in his power to undermine Trump and undermine US Democracy, while risking escalating, already high tensions with Russia.Continue reading this story at The DuranREAD MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files",US_News,"December 15, 2016",5611
HUCKABEE BACKS TRUMP’S COMMENTS ON PROTESTS: “Is he supposed to do what Barack Obama used to do and jump to conclusions”,"A voice of reason speaks out! Mike Huckabee told Fox News host Judge Jeanine Pirro that he has a  special repulsion  for white supremacists and that Trump did the right thing in his statements about Charlottesville. It s part because I m white,  he elaborated.  It s part because I have seen this evil and hateful attitude that elevates some people above others. And as a believing Christian, I m especially offended because anybody who believes The Bible, especially the gospels, will have to accept that there is no way that God is a respecter of persons- as scripture makes clear, He doesn t love some people more than others because of their color, because of their affiliation, even with Him. He mentioned that because he believe in the gospels that  every person has equal worth,  that makes him pro-life.Pirro asked Huckabee if the outrage over the president s remarks are just  Trump haters  who   will look for any reason to dump on  him. Well it seems like a lot of them are, I don t know what they expect the president to do,  Huckabee responded.  At the time that he made the comment, the driver of the car had not even been identified. That s exactly right!  Pirro exclaimed. And so what is he supposed to say?  Huckabee continued.  Is he supposed to do what Barack Obama used to do and jump to conclusion and make a decision like he did in Ferguson. Missouri, which turned out to be totally untrue? The president has to be careful in taking steps. I thought what he condemned was what we all could immediately condemn and that was the violence, the car some coward in a car drove into innocent people to try and kill them. And he condemned that! What else is he supposed to do at that point? Amen!Via: Mediate ",politics,"Aug 12, 2017",1724
FIRST FEMALE MUSLIM Legislator Votes To Make Life Insurance Companies Do The UNTHINKABLE For Dead Terrorists [VIDEO],"She burst on the scene last August when she upset a 44-year incumbent Democrat in the Minnesota state primary elections to become the nation s first female Muslim state legislator.Ilhan Omar, the 34-year-old community organizer who came to America as a refugee from Somalia, was touted by Democrats as a model success story. From a refugee camp to the State Capitol with intelligence and insight,  beamed former Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak, who endorsed Omar.  This is a wonderful story to tell as Americans, and a great source of pride for the state of Minnesota s open arms. But on Thursday Omar made her mark in another way.She was one of only two members of the Minnesota State House to vote against a bill that would allow life insurance companies to deny payouts to the beneficiaries of terrorists who die in violent attacks on Americans.Omar, who represents the heavily immigrant Cedar Riverside area of Minneapolis, was joined by fellow Democratic Rep. John Lesch of St. Paul in voting against the bill.Omar s vote sticks out because at least 42 Somali refugees have been confirmed by the FBI to have left the U.S. to join overseas terrorist organizations, including al-Shabab, the al-Qaida affiliate in Somalia, and ISIS in Syria and Iraq.Dozens of other Somali-Americans have been tried and/or convicted of providing material support to overseas terrorists.The Minneapolis-St. Paul area is home to the nation s largest Somali refugee community.The Minnesota insurance bill was introduced by Rep. Joe Hoppe, R-Chaska, in response to Syed Farook s jihadist rampage in San Bernardino, California, in December 2015 in which he shot and killed 14 people and injured 22 at an office Christmas party. Farook made sure his life insurance policies worth $275,000 were valid before conducting the deadly shooting with help from his wife, Tashfeen Malik.After Farook died in a shootout with police, his mother fought to remain the beneficiary of the life insurance policies. The insurance company balked and the case has gone to court.Democratic Rep. Debra Hilstrom said the goal of the Minnesota bill  is to make certain that folks don t benefit [from terrorism] and this limits the beneficiary to the premiums that were paid in. It limits the exposure for the insurance company when someone is committing an act of terrorism.   WNDWatch:",politics,"Apr 22, 2017",2339
KARMA: Race-Obsessed Detroit Free Press Editorial Editor Who Led Effort To Destroy Kid Rock’s Career Is FIRED Over Allegations of Inappropriate Behavior With Female Colleagues,"In September 2016, Stephen Henderson, the editorial editor of the Detroit Free Press, used the power of his pen to unjustly attack Kid Rock, after liberals feared Rock might actually be serious about running as a Republican contender against the do-nothing Democrat Senator Debbie Stabenow. As a Michigan resident, I can say with a great level of confidence, that besides Mike Illitch, the now deceased owner of the Red Wings and Detroit Tigers, Kid Rock has done more for the city of Detroit and for the black community than almost anyone in this state. When the Illitch s asked Detroit legend and philanthropist, Kid Rock to perform for the opening of their much anticipated Little Caesar s Arena, no one could have dreamed that the Detroit Free Press  Stephen Henderson would have used his position to push a lie, that Kid Rock, the single father of a black son, and NAACP award recipient is a  racist .Here s what Henderson had to say about Kid Rock, the man who has done so much for the city of Detroit:This is a musician who got rich off crass cultural appropriation of black music, who used to wrap his brand in the Confederate flag   a symbol inextricably linked to racism, no matter what its defenders say   and who has repeatedly issued profane denouncements of the very idea of African Americans pushing back against American inequality. Just last week, he trashed Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback who s jobless right now because he dared challenge the nation s racism with a silent, kneeling protest during the pre-football game singing of the national anthem. Having Kid Rock open this arena is erecting a sturdy middle finger to Detroiters   nothing less. And the Ilitches, who ve done so much for this city and also taken so much from it, should be the last to embrace that kind of signaling.Here is how Kid Rock responded on his Facebook page:People! Pay NO attention to the garbage the extreme left is trying to create! (and by the way, fuck the extreme left and the extreme right!)They are trying to use the old confederate flag BS, etc. to stir the pot, when we all know none of this would be going on if I were not thinking of running for office. Pretty funny how scared I have them all and their only agenda is to try and label people / me racist who do not agree or cower to them!! No one had a word to say when we sold out the 6 shows at LCA back in January! My track record in Detroit and Michigan speaks for itself, and I would dare anyone talking trash to put theirs up against mine. I am also a homeowner and taxpayer in the city of Detroit, so suck on that too!I am the bona fide KING OF DETROIT LOVE and it makes me smile down deep that you haters know that! Your jealousy is merely a reflection of disgust for your own failures and lack of positive ideas for our city.I am however very disappointed that none of the people, businesses or charities I have so diligently supported in Detroit have had anything to say about all these unfounded attacks from these handful of jackasses and The Detroit Free Press. So for the unforeseen future I will focus my philanthropy efforts on other organizations besides the ones I have supported in the past. I would however employ that NAN go ahead and make up these losses since they claim to be so good for Detroit and do not want me opening the arena and generating tons of jobs and tax dollars for the city and people I LOVE  IDIOTS!  .. (Has Al Sharpton even paid his back taxes yet?)Today, the race-obsessed Stephen Henderson, got some very bad news AP   The Detroit Free Press fired Stephen Henderson, its managing director of opinion and commentary, after finding what it called credible allegations of inappropriate behavior with female colleagues, the newspaper announced Friday.Free Press Editor and Vice President Peter Bhatia announced Henderson s termination in a story that said the allegations go back several years. Gannett Co. Inc., the newspaper s parent company, says Henderson s behavior  has been inconsistent with company values and standards. Henderson said in a statement to The Detroit News and Crain s Detroit Business that he is  stunned. I dedicated 18 years to this newspaper over three decades, all of it performing at the highest level,  Henderson said.  I may have more to say on this later, but for now there is much other work to be done here in the city of Detroit. Stephen is a magnificent journalist and a treasured colleague who has done so much for Detroit,  Bhatia said. He added there were no accusations of sexual assault, but said the incidents involving inappropriate behavior and comments directed at Free Press employees ran counter to company policies.Less than 2 months ago, Henderson appeared on Meet The Press and called America a racist nation with a racist history:Rich Lowry of the National Review appeared with Stephen Henderson on Meet The Press to discuss Colin Kaepernick and other NFL players who disrespect the flag as a way to support Black Lives Matter. Henderson argued,  Some of the words in the national anthem are racist.  Henderson argued that it was appropriate to show disrespect for the American flag because he thinks America is a country whose history is racist. Henderson told the panel,  I think this is a country whose history is racist, whose history is steeped in white supremacy, and the anthem reflects that in its very words   (inaudible) . Lowry responded to Henderson by saying,  It s also a nation with very important ideals that have worn down those injustices over time and created a more just society. And people have died under that flag for those ideals. Watch:",politics,"Dec 15, 2017",5644

Insiders tell me that the possibilities for chief of staff include:House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who developed a bond with Trump as one of the earlier congressional leaders to support him, and remains a confidant.Wayne Berman of Blackstone Group, a Washington heavy-hitter who was an Assistant Secretary of Commerce under President George H.W. Bush, and a key adviser on eight presidential campaigns.David Urban of the Washington advisory firm American Continental Group, and a former chief of staff to the late Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.).

 One Person On Hillary’s Shortlist For VP Was Just Removed From DNC Speaker Schedule,"It you re into puzzles and figuring stuff out, you ve been loving the past few weeks trying to figure out who the vice presidential picks for either major party will be. Now that we know Indiana Gov. Mike Pence is Donald Trump s pick, we re now left to sift through clues to figure out who Hillary Clinton will give the nod too.Well, one huge clue was given when Elizabeth Warren showed up at Hillary Clinton s Washington D.C. home today, but an ever bigger clue has come as Warren s name appears to no longer be on the speaking schedule for the Democratic National Convention.Originally slotted to speak as the keynote speaker on Monday night of the convention, Warren s name is now missing.According to Politico, this is the schedule as it stands now:Monday:  First Lady Michelle Obama, Senator Bernie Sanders and DREAMer Astrid Silva Gavel time expected at 3:00 p.m.Tuesday:  President Bill Clinton Gavel time expected at 4:00 p.m.Also scheduled Tuesday are Mothers of the Movement members Gwen Carr, Mother of Eric Garner; Sybrina Fulton, Mother of Trayvon Martin; Maria Hamilton, Mother of Dontr  Hamilton; Lucia McBath, Mother of Jordan Davis; Lezley McSpadden, Mother of Michael Brown; Cleopatra Pendleton-Cowley, Mother of Hadiya Pendleton; Geneva Reed-Veal, Mother of Sandra Bland.Wednesday:  President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden Gavel time expected at 4:30 p.m.Thursday:  Hillary Clinton and Chelsea Clinton Gavel time expected at 4:30 p.m.Very interesting indeed.Noticeably also missing are other members on Clinton s shortlist for vice president, such as Sherrod Brown and Tim Kaine, but seeing as Warren was scheduled to speak, and now isn t, it could be very, very telling.Now that Trump has rounded out his ticket with Mike Pence, a man who represents the only group Trump has yet to openly hate   the LGBT community   it s looking pretty good for Clinton come November, and hopefully whoever she picks as her VP will round out the ticket nicely.Featured image via Jessica Kourkounis/Getty Images",News,"July 15, 2016",2026

 Trump Humiliated By Being Forced To Sign Russia Sanctions Bill Which Limits His Power,"Amateur president Donald Trump  signed was forced to sign a bill today to punish Russia for its interference in the 2016 election despite his reservations to tighten sanctions against Moscow. The 71-year-old Twitter-addict did not hold a signing ceremony. In late July, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a bill giving Congress the power to block any effort by the White House to weaken sanctions on Russia. That move was a direct challenge to Donald Trump s authority. So, Trump really had no choice here especially since his campaign is the focus of the probe into Russia s meddling in the presidential election last year.  The legislation was passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress.The bill limits Trump s ability to lift or waive sanctions against Russia. The bill keeps in place sanctions imposed by the Obama administration last year.

The action by the Congress to put these sanctions in place and the way they did, neither the president nor I were very happy about that,  Tillerson said on Tuesday.  We were clear that we didn t think it was going to be helpful to our efforts.

Another close Clinton aide told the FBI that  Abedin may have kept emails that Clinton did not. The electronic device shared by Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin and husband Anthony Weiner on which the FBI found more Clinton emails was a laptop and it contained tens-of-thousands of emails, a senior law enforcement official told Fox News on Saturday.The FBI announced Friday that it had restarted an investigation into emails Clinton sent on a private server system while secretary of state, as a result of a probe into Abedin s husband, disgraced New York Democratic Rep.

However, federal investigators remain unclear whether Abedin or Weiner own the laptop.The FBI conducted a roughly two-year investigation into Clinton s use of a private server system, finding several emails marked as classified and concluded that she had been  extremely careless.  However, the agency did not find evidence that Clinton had been criminally negligent and did not recommend criminal charges to the Justice Department.People familiar with the case say it was restarted by the FBI because the agency thought the new emails were  pertinent to the investigation.

" Democrat Examines Trump’s Latest Twitter Meltdown, Asks The ONE Question We Were ALL Wondering (DETAILS)","Donald Trump s presidency is still one of the most baffling train wrecks Americans have seen in a long time. If his racist, misogynist rhetoric and pathological lying weren t enough to raise concerns about, his Twitter activity alone should have prevented people from voting for him   and for those that had hope for him, he s been busy proving them wrong every single day since he got in the White House.He hasn t even lasted a month in his new role yet, and already people are scrambling to find ways to get rid of him before he destroys the country. With his massive amounts of inhumane executive orders and reckless handling of world affairs, Trump s mental competency is under scrutiny   and for good reason.On Saturday, Trump launched into one of his insane Twitter fits, and this time he was more incoherent than ever. He not only whined about  FAKE NEWS  and the New York Times, but he attacked the  so-called judge  who dared to block his disgusting Muslim ban. Oh, and let s not forget about the fact that Trump also shared a fake article about Kuwait, forcing the country to respond and the situation to erupt in chaos before the situation was corrected.Given the emotional roller coaster that the Trump presidency has already become in such a short amount of time, many people are calling for him to have a psychological review   and one of those people is Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA), who took a look at Trump s Twitter tantrum and asked the question we ve all been wanting to know. Here it is: Should he get a mental health exam? Hell YES. A few hours later, Lieu fired back at Trump again for posting yet another weird, narcissistic tweet: his campaign slogan,  Make America Great Again. It would be in America s best interest if Trump were professionally evaluated. Lieu is not the only politician calling for a psychological review, either. Earlier this week, top Democrat Nancy Pelosi spoke out in support of having mental evaluations for presidents   which we all know would have destroyed every chance Trump had.Like him or hate him, Trump is not well and being in his role is not only dangerous for him, but for the rest of the world.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images",News,"February 5, 2017",2198
 Identities Of Arrested Anti-Racist Stone Mountain Protesters Released (VIDEO),"Authorities have released the identities of nine men who were arrested on April 23 during a clash between about a dozen white supremacist demonstrators, a group of counter-protesters and police in Stone Mountain, Georgia.According to WXIA, chaos broke out after a  pro-white  organization planned a rally at Stone Mountain Park on Saturday. The white supremacist group  Rock Stone Mountain  organized the demonstration to protest what they claim are  efforts to erase the white race. In response, a second group of counter-protesters called  All Out Atlanta  also staged a demonstration at the park.Only about two dozen white supremacists attended the protest, while counter protesters numbered somewhere between 200 and 300, according to local reports.Both groups were granted permits by park authorities.Police say the opposing protest groups were to be located in different areas of the park.Things went bad, however, when two members of the  pro-white  group got lost and ended up in the middle of the counter-demonstration.Police from three different agencies, dressed in riot gear, descended on the area.Video shows one of the men from the white supremacist organization referring to counter-protesters as  savages.

 WATCH: President Obama Doesn’t Give A F*ck About Donald Trump’s Birther Annoucement,"President  Zero F*cks Left  Obama strikes again.Donald Trump addressed his leading role in the birther conspiracy regarding President Obama s birth certificate on Friday, but President Obama isn t impressed.On Thursday, the Republican nominee refused yet again to answer whether he believes that President Obama was born in Hawaii, telling the Washington Post,  I ll answer that question at the right time. I just don t want to answer it yet. Following the interview, Trump s campaign issued a disgusting statement making Donald Trump look like a hero while painting Hillary Clinton as the villain in the story. In 2011, Mr. Trump was finally able to bring this ugly incident to its conclusion by successfully compelling President Obama to release his birth certificate. Mr. Trump did a great service to the President and the country by bringing closure to the issue that Hillary Clinton and her team first raised. The problem is that Hillary and her campaign had nothing to do with the birther conspiracy. As Politifact pointed out when it debunked Trump s claim last year, it was a mere volunteer who started the conspiracy via email. No campaign official, nor Hillary Clinton herself, ever questioned President Obama s citizenship.Donald Trump, however, engaged in a vicious racist witch hunt over President Obama s birth certificate. Trump constantly claimed that President Obama was not an American and that he was born in Kenya. Of course, Trump was utterly humiliated by President Obama when he released his full birth certificate to the public for all to see, even though he did not have to do so.But Trump has refused to personally acknowledge that President Obama is the legitimate Commander-in-Chief and has never apologized for his attacks.On Friday, Trump finally acknowledged that President Obama was born in America, but still didn t apologize. President Barack Obama was born in the United States,  Trump said before adding,  Period. But it doesn t matter what Trump says because President Obama doesn t give a damn about what Trump has to say.When asked about Trump s upcoming announcement prior, President Obama slammed Trump and his birtherism. I m shocked that a question like that would come up at a time when we ve got so many other things to do   well, I m not that shocked actually. It s fairly typical. We got other business to attend to. I was pretty confident about where I was born. I think most people were as well an my hope would be that the presidential election reflects more serious issues than that.

Nasty Liberal Lawyer Just Got A Dose Of Karma After Saying He’d ‘Be Ok’ If Female Trump Official Was Sexually Assaulted,"Texas Civil Rights lawyer, Rob Ranco made a really bad move last Friday evening when he took to twitter to make a disgusting comment about Betsy DeVos:  I m not wishing for it  but I d be ok if #BetsyDevos was sexually assaulted. A screenshot of the tweet is below. Ranco suddenly deleted his twitter account the next morning. Luckily, the tweet was captured before he deleted it.Ranco had more to say to Education Secretary DeVos:  Make the world more dangerous for my daughters   intentionally   and your well being is not my concern. Full stop. Ranco was responding to DeVos  reversal of an OBAMA policy that intervened in local school procedures by imposing un-American, unfair, and downright scary  rules  that automatically ruin the lives of male college students so long as any wack job nut accuses him of something. Kangeroo college  tribunals  railroad these people. That was OBAMA s doing. DaVos is thankfully doing something to reverse that travesty.On campus, one rape, one assault, one gone w/o due process, is one too many. ~Betsy DeVos Yes, the left HATES this. pic.twitter.com/Wl9qyHqw3P  AMERICA HAS SPOKEN (@ChooseToBFree) September 12, 2017Ranco was hammered on social media!

 This Photo Of Donald Trump And His Daughter Will Creep You Out (TWEET),"Donald Trump is definitely a controversial figure and his run for the Republican nomination for the presidency has been a source of revulsion to many as a result of his racist and misogynist ways. Well folks, get ready to be repulsed even more! Here s a photo of the Donald and his natural born daughter Ivonka in 1996:A picture of Donald Trump, with his daughter Ivanka, perched atop two concrete parrots having sex. pic.twitter.com/TFse8gM1An  Tim Ireland (@bloggerheads) January 31, 2016Now, there are several things that are clearly wrong with this photo that would cause an involuntary, forceful expulsion of the contents of one s stomach through the mouth.The most important reason: It s his daughter! Ivonka is sitting in between her dad s legs while he has his arms around her waist. This is not a photo of a loving father with his daughter. Rather, it s an older creepy looking dude with a very young woman.There are simply too many sexual messages in this photo that make it unnatural and wrong. For example, what the hell are those parrots in the photo doing? You guessed it, the big parrot is f***ing the little parrot!Ivanka Trump was born in 1981 and this photo was taken in 1996. That means that Ivonka was around 15 at the time the photo was taken. That means she s underage! Why would any parent allow his underage daughter to wear such an outfit knowing that millions of people will potentially see it? No responsible parent would do such a thing with his kid.Donald Trump has said some pretty creepy things about his daughter in the past. Here s what he said in 2006 on ABC s the View when the host asked him about how he would feel if Ivonka posed for Playboy: It would be really disappointing   not really   but it would depend on what s inside the magazine. I don t think Ivanka would do that, although she does have a very nice figure. I ve said if Ivanka weren t my daughter, perhaps I d be dating her. In 2003, Trump bragged about his daughter s body on the Howard Stern Show: You know who s one of the great beauties of the world, according to everybody? And I helped create her. Ivanka. My daughter, Ivanka. She s 6 feet tall, she s got the best body. She made a lot money as a model a tremendous amount. And this guy, folks, is leading the polls for the Republican nomination for the presidency of the United States. It tell us a lot about the Republican party.Featured Image Via Wikimedia Commons.

 Man Says He ‘Didn’t Mean To Offend Anyone’ With Float Featuring Trump Executing Hillary (IMAGE),"Residents in Aurora, Indiana are upset after seeing a parade float on Saturday which depicted Donald Trump flipping the switch on Hillary Clinton in an electric chair. As if that wasn t bad enough, the float also featured someone in blackface portraying President Obama as an Easter Island figure with an oversized head. The float is plastered with a Trump/Pence sign, a Make America Great Again sign and of course, something with Benghazi written on it and it also mentions Clinton s health.An Aurora mother posted a photo on Facebook of the offensive float. Who thinks this is appropriate for a fair parade where children, some of them minorities and girls, are marching and playing instruments and watching? Who thinks this is something to laugh at or be proud of?  Penny Britton wrote on her Facebook page.  This is disgusting. This makes me embarrassed to say I live here. This is Aurora, Indiana. Congratulations. That prompted different comments ranging from calling it  disgusting  and  racist,  to another saying  Who cares! On Saturday morning, the float was featured as part of the Aurora Farmers Fair Parade.WCPO reports:It s sponsored by the Aurora Lions Club, according to its website, and touted as Indiana s oldest street festival. The theme of the parade was  Celebrating the Past, Embracing the Future. A Lions Club board member spoke with WCPO and said the organization was not prepared to make a statement.The parade manager did not return a call by a WCPO reporter.Meanwhile, Frank Linkmeyer, whose trailer which held the float is now in his driveway, says he didn t mean to offend anyone and he s sorry. He did a really bad job of trying to not be offensive. We re pretty sure Trump supporters will say it s being politically correct to object because children have to witness a display of racism. One man said,  If anyone is offended by it, well don t look at it.  It s pretty hard to change the channel on a parade you re attending. The float was right there in everyone s faces.Images via screen capture. ",News,"October 3, 2016",2030
 Donald Trump Just Attacked A Crying Baby At His Virginia Rally (VIDEO),"You know the age-old political trope that politicians spend a lot of time kissing babies? Well, Trump just turned that on his head when he dedicated a few minutes of a rally in Virginia on Tuesday to attacking a screaming infant in the audience   an actual screaming infant, not one of his followers. Don t worry about that baby, I love babies,  Trump told the child s mother.  I love babies. I hear that baby crying. I like it. I like it. What a beautiful baby. The mom s running around like  don t worry about it.  It s young and beautiful and healthy and that s what we want. After prattling on about China, Iraq, and Afghanistan devaluing currency, Trump couldn t resist going back to the baby situation: Actually I was only kidding, you can get the baby out of here. That s all right. Don t worry. I think she really believed me that I love having a baby crying while I m speaking. That s ok, people don t understand. That s OK. And the crowd cheered, though perhaps not as loudly when Trump is siccing them on a black man who had the nerve to speak out in support of his rights or anyone else who has been beaten by his followers after Trump issued his orders.This wasn t the only child who gave Trump problems at that rally. CBS  Sopan Deb noticed a boy no older than 10 screaming  Take that bitch down!  when The Donald mentioned Hillary Clinton.This phrase, along with a number of other profanity-laden attacks on Clinton, is regularly heard at Trump rallies, but the child s mother had an interesting scapegoat for her terrible parenting. NBC s Katy Tur followed up on the  bitch  kid and spoke to the mother, who simply explained that  Children are children. While it is true that kids will be kids, most don t scream  take that bitch down  at a gathering of white supremacists and other assorted creeps, cretins, and idiots. The woman told The Guardian s Ben Jacobs that  Democratic schools  are to blame for her child s behavior, adding that  he has a right to speak what he wants to.  Which is it, mom? Are the Democrats to blame for your brat s shitty behavior, or are you for giving him the freedom to speak as he wishes? Would your reaction be the same if he yelled that about you?It s worth noting that Trump said nothing about this screaming child   but CNN s Jason Carroll pointed out perhaps the most horrible aspect of this mess. After mentioning that Trump accepted a wounded veteran s Purple Heart, noting that he has  always wanted one  and that it was  much easier  than actually earning it by making sacrifices for his country, Carroll told the story of the baby: The crowd laughed. They enjoyed it. Was it a bit off color? Yes. But this is what people like about this man. Watch the CNN clip below: Featured image via NY Daily News",News,"August 2, 2016",2759
BREAKING NEWS: MUSLIM WHITE HOUSE HACKER the Obama Regime Hired Arrested at Airport Trying to Flee the US,"Dem Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz Pakistani IT staffer Imran Awan was arrested at Dulles airport while trying to flee the United States. Get the back story from Maria Bartiromo:  How is it possible that 3 brothers are hired, Muslim brothers just saying, to work in Congress and deal with our most intelligent and sensitive information, number one? They were all making $160,000! Why were they paid so much? 22 years old one of the guys, the other was 25. They re making $160,000, $161,000 and $165,000. And one of them has a criminal background! If you haven t been following this crazy series of events, we ve got a previous report below to fill you in. Basically, Imran Awan and three Muslim relatives were hired to handle IT for the DNC which gave them access to lots of sensitive information NOT GOOD! The Daily Caller just exclusively reported that Awan attempted to destroy hard drives then desperately tried to retrieve them when they were discovered.GETTING THOSE DESTROYED HARD RIVES BACK:Pakistani-born Imran Awan, long-time right-hand IT aide to the former Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chairwoman, has since desperately tried to get the hard drives back, the individual told The Daily Caller News Foundation s Investigative Group.A high-level congressional source, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the probe, confirmed that the FBI has joined what Politico previously described as a Capitol Police criminal probe into  serious, potentially illegal, violations on the House IT network  by Imran and three of his relatives, who had access to the emails and files of the more than two dozen House Democrats who employed them on a part-time basis.Capitol Police have also seized computer equipment tied to the Florida lawmaker.Awan s younger brothers, Abid and Jamal, his wife, Hina Alvi, and Rao Abbas, Imran s best friend, are also under investigation. There have been no arrests in the case.THIS CASE IS HUGE! MARIA BARTIROMO IS LIVID ABOUT IT:A Pakistani family under criminal investigation by the U.S. Capitol Police (see our previous report below) for abusing their access to the House of Representatives information technology (IT) system may have engaged in myriad other questionable schemes besides allegedly placing  ghost employees  on the congressional payroll.Imran Awan, his wife Hina, and brothers Abid and Jamal collectively netted more than $4 million in salary as IT administrators for House Democrats between 2009 and 2017. Yet the absence of signs of wealth displayed among them raise questions such as was the money sent overseas or did something other than paychecks motivate their actions?Capitol Police revoked the Awans  access to the congressional IT system in February 2017 after a major data breach was detected. Their access had allowed them to read emails and files of dozens of members, including many serving on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Committee on Foreign Affairs.OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON THIS   THE MAIN STREAM MEDIA IS IGNORING THE CRIMINALITY OF THESE BROTHERS:3 MUSLIM BROTHERS Working For Dems In Congress CAUGHT Accessing Unauthorized Top-Secret Government Intel One Has Criminal Background May Have Ties To Muslim Brotherhood [VIDEO]3 Congressional IT employees have been fired for accessing members computer networks without permission. Maria s on the show, knows more about this. Can you fill me in a bit.Here are their names Stuart. let me tell you what the 3 people that were fired on Thursday: Abid, Imran and Jamal Awan. They were barred from computer networks at the House of Representatives on Thursday because they accessed Congressmen and Congress people s computer networks unauthorized. At a minimum they were fired. At a minimum we know that they accessed computers unauthorized and they did so in foreign intelligence, foreign affairs and intelligence committees.  Okay? So they were getting very important information, government information. They accessed these computers. That is the least of it. There s also some talk that people are looking into what ties they have into terrorism. Are they impacted by the Muslim Brotherhood? Are they a part of the Muslim Brotherhood? One of them has a criminal background!How is it possible that 3 brothers are hired, Muslim brothers just saying, to work in Congress and deal with our most intelligent and sensitive information, number one? They were all making $160,000! Why were they paid so much? 22 years old one of the guys, the other was 25. They re making $160,000, $161,000 and $165,000. And one of them has a criminal background! I hear what you re saying, I mean, these intelligence committees handle our terror strategies right? They got in on Benghazi by the way.Yes, and they also worked for many Democrats in the House. They are thinking that they may be also one of the reasons Debbie Wasserman Schultz got hacked. There s so much more to come on this Stuart, it s an incredible story. I think it s amazing!Chiefs of staff for dozens of Democratic lawmakers who employed the four were informed last week that a criminal probe was underway into their use of congressional information technology systems, including the existence of an external server to which House data was being funneled, and into the theft of and overbilling for computer equipment.Their salaries and time were shared among dozens of Democratic members, including former Democratic National Committee Chairman Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida.Chiefs of staff for dozens of Democratic lawmakers who employed the four were informed last week that a criminal probe was underway into their use of congressional information technology systems, including the existence of an external server to which House data was being funneled, and into the theft of and overbilling for computer equipment.Despite the generous salaries, the four were involved in multiple suspicious mortgage transfers and a debt-evading bankruptcy. Abid had more than $1 million in debts following a failed business called Cars International that he ran in Falls Church, Va., from November 2009 to September 2010. Business associates said in court documents that Abid had stolen money and vehicles from them.It s unclear how Abid found time to run an automotive business while working full-time for Congress. He had been on the congressional payroll since 2005. A congressional credit union repossessed two of his personal cars before the business folded.Abid filed for bankruptcy in 2012, but somehow managed to keep ownership of two houses while telling the bankruptcy court and creditors that he had no assets with which to pay them. He signed a sworn statement that he and his wife, Natalia Soba, were living apart and needed separate residences. My spouse and I are legally separated under applicable non-bankruptcy law or my spouse and I are living apart other than for the purpose of evading the requirements of   707(b)(2)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code,  Abid claimed in bankruptcy documents. But both houses had been in the family for years.Abid s record includes numerous driving- and alcohol-related legal problems, including driving with a suspended or revoked license, court records show. He was found guilty of drunk driving a month before he started at the House, and was arrested for public intoxication a month after his first day.A spokesman for Rep. Joaquin Castro of Texas told TheDCNF Friday that Jamal s  employment with our office has been terminated. Hilarie Chambers, a spokeswoman for Rep. Sandy Levin   who employed Abid   told TheDCNF that  after being notified by the House Administration Committee, this individual was removed from our payroll. We are confident that everything in our office is secure. Not every Democrat is willing to terminate their connection with these four:Some Democrats have not terminated their connection with the four, including Wasserman Schultz, who employs Imran and who resigned from her DNC post last year after a computer hack revealed embarassing emails. Derrick Robinson, spokesman for California Rep. Karen Bass, refused to comment on Alvi s employment status.For entire story: Daily Caller",politics,"Jul 25, 2017",8190
 ‘I’m Not A Racist’: Trump Campaign Official Blames Media For Racist Tirade Against The Obamas,"Carl Paladino, who served as the co-chairman of Donald Trump s New York campaign, wrote a wish list of what he d like for the New Year. He wished death and beastiality upon President Obama and wanted the First Lady to be  let loose  in Africa to live with a gorilla. Paladino also serves as a Buffalo School Board member and people have been calling for him to resign over his racist attack on the Obamas. I was wired up, primed to be human and make a mistake,  he wrote in a statement obtained by WBEN.  I could not have made a worse choice in the words I used to express my feelings. And that s where he should have stopped but unfortunately, he didn t:Even as Paladino apologized for hurting  the minority community  with his racist remarks, he took shots at the  attacking parasites,   vanquished progressive haters,  and  mean spirited disoriented press [sic]  who took issue with his comments. He also called Obama a  yellow-bellied coward  and  lazy ass president. I certainly am not a racist,  he insisted, then stated,  No, I m not leaving the school board.  He said he made a mistake then he blamed the media.Paladino also said the survey answers were accidentally sent to Artvoice. I filled out the survey to send to a couple friends and forwarded it to them not realizing that I didn t hit  forward  I hit  reply,  he said.  All men make mistakes.  In other words, he didn t mean to get caught being a racist.In the survey, Paladino wrote that he hopes  Obama catches mad cow disease after being caught having relations with a Herford. He added that he wishes  [Obama] dies before his trial and is buried in a cow pasture next to Valerie Jarret [sic], who died weeks prior, after being convicted of sedition and treason, when a Jihady [sic] cell mate [sic] mistook her for being a nice person and decapitated her. As for Mrs. Obama, he said he would  like her to return to being a male and let loose in the outback of Zimbabwe where she lives comfortably in a cave with Maxie, the gorilla. Yes, you are a racist, Mr. Paladino. Put your big boy pants on and own your words instead of attacking the media for reporting it.Photo by Audrey C. Tiernan-Pool/Getty",News,"December 27, 2016",2169
WATCH: TRUMP YARD SIGN VANDALS Get Big Surprise When Homeowner Pulls Gun On Them,"A Californian with a gun and a Trump sign in his front yard. Sounds like defending that sign could turn into a full-time job A San Diego man with a Donald Trump yard sign in front of his house confronted a group of would-be vandals with a rifle on Wednesday evening. The vandals panicked and dialed 911. Police questioned the resident, Taren Meacham, but did not arrest him. Local ABC News affiliate 10 News reports:At around 10 p.m., a neighbor reportedly witnessed a group of four friends who had been walking down a sidewalk in the 100 block of West Juniper Street meddling with the campaign sign. The friends appeared to have been drinking.Witnesses told San Diego police, the neighbor allegedly exited his home with a rifle and threatened the group using profanity. At one point he allegedly told them,  I ve been waiting to use this. One of the people attempting to vandalize the sign recalled the event from her perspective:Ashton Ferejan says she panicked when he pointed the gun at her, her husband and friends, I kind of just screamed  get back, get back,  some of us yelled, my husband was like  are you serious, put down the weapon, this is ridiculous,  Ferejan said.Neighbors reportedly know Meacham, who owns a tattoo shop named  Love and Terror,  as a calm person. Evidently, however, he was prepared to defend his political preferences and his property.Meacham was recently featured by the San Diego Union-Tribune in a photo gallery of local Trump supporters:Vandalism of Trump yard signs is not new in Southern California. Recently, Breitbart News noted a case in which a Trump sign in Oceanside had been defaced with the words  f*** you a-hole,  with the message signed,  a Mexican. Criminal charges are unlikely against Meecham, who did not actually fire his rifle in the incident. Via: Breitbart News",politics,"Jun 17, 2016",1820

OBAMA’S ORGANIZED RACE WAR EXPOSED AS PROTESTORS REVEAL PROOF OF PAYMENT," My success in the financial markets has given me a greater degree of independence than most other people,  Soros once wrote.  This allows me to take a stand on controversial issues: In fact, it obliges me to do so because others cannot.  -George SorosMORE and OBS, two groups funded by George Soros, advertised money available for people willing to travel to protest (@organizemo is the twitter account of MORE): Listen to radical socialist George Soros talk about his innocuous <sarcasm> and oh so  transparent  little organization here:George Soros gives billions to left-wing causes: Soros started the Open Society Institute in 1993 as a way to spread his wealth to progressive causes. Using Open Society as a conduit, Soros has given more than $7 billion to a who s who of left-wing groups. This partial list of recipients of Soros  money says it all:ACORN, Apollo Alliance, National Council of La Raza, Tides Foundation, Huffington Post, Southern Poverty Law Center, Soujourners, People for the American Way, Planned Parenthood, and the National Organization for Women.George Soros wants to curtail American sovereignty: Soros would like nothing better than for America to become subservient to international bodies. He wants more power for groups such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, even while saying the U.S. role in the IMF should be  downsized.  In 1998, he wrote:  Insofar as there are collective interests that transcend state boundaries, the sovereignty of states must be subordinated to international law and international institutions. After protesters protested not getting their checks from MORE on May 14th, MORE allegedly distributed the following list as to who was paid to protest in Ferguson and elsewhere, to show where the money had been going.Obviously, as we ve mentioned before, this is far from a  grass roots spontaneous  protest.You can see money paid out to Lisa Fithian, $1,127.75 for  visit expenses .For those who do not know, Lisa Fithian is an infamous leftist organizer. She organized at Occupy, but has been used as a training organizer for many years before that. She spent time in Ferguson in 2014 training people to  simulate chaos. Is it possible that George Soros has a love affair with Lisa Fithian because of their common hatred for Israel?Also of note, you can see that some people are being paid to travel to other places to protest, you can see the travel to Selma, and to D.C., as well as money paid out for  vans , including to a union for providing the vans. Elizabeth Vega got $2000 for  activist trip to Baltimore .There is money paid for protester supplies and protester catering, as well as for video recording of the protests. Some things were not so defined such as $2000 to Taylor Payne for  support .$52,815 is paid to MORE. Money clearly was to go through them to the protesters, according to the protesters during their #Cuthtechecks protest.There are big payouts to Jeff Ordower. Jeff Ordower is a bit like a male Lisa Fithian, he was an organizer for the SEIU and ACORN. He founded MORE and his stated goal is  welcoming co-conspirators in attempts to scale up numbers of radical organizers who can financially support themselves in the work . He is the white man protesters are complaining to in this clip, when they protested not getting paid. He would appear to be disburser of the checks.WCC hot seat pic.twitter.com/Uo65IC2Uuz  Search4Swag (@search4swag) May 14, 2015Brittany Ferrell and Ashley Yates receive thousands on behalf of MAU, Millenial Activists United, one of the protester groups.

 This Leaked Secret Memo Reveals A YUGE Problem Destroying Trump (IMAGE),"An internal memo leaked from Donald Trump s campaign to the national press shows that his cultish campaign team is not dealing well with the campaign s most recent round of negative press. The memo was leaked to the Washington Post from a Republican operative in touch with Trump s inner circle.The memo, from senior Trump adviser Barry Bennett, doesn t look good:Entitled  Digging through the Bull [expletive],  Bennett s memo urged Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski   who was charged with battery last week for yanking a reporter   and others to ignore critics who have questioned whether Trump s campaign for the Republican presidential nomination has waned. America is sick of them. Their idiotic attacks just remind voters why they hate the Washington Establishment,  Bennett wrote, citing tracking poll data favorable to Trump. Donald Trump 1,  Bennett declared, as if he was scoring the past week.  Washington Establishment/Media 0. By nature, most campaigns devolve into a bunker mentality, but this document reads more like a personal letter to Donald Trump to buck up after a disastrous week. Rather than seriously citing any data or giving strategy advice to Trump and his team, the memo follows the candidate s well-worn pattern of attacking its detractors while pumping up the boss. It s more evidence of the Trump campaign being more like a cult than an operation designed to elect a commander-in-chief.Trump stumbled badly over a key issue, abortion, this past week. He offered multiple positions on the issue, while also advocating for  punishment  for women who have the procedure   something that would happen if Republicans get their wish in outlawing abortion, but also a topic more skilled Republican politicians know how to avoid.He s also in a bad place in Wisconsin, polling behind Senator Ted Cruz ahead of the primary there after being ahead of him by 10 percent a month ago.In the most recent national polls, Trump is on a path to be a disaster against both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.

 Trump Brags About His Inauguration’s TV Ratings And Gets A BRUTAL Reality Check,"Donald Trump s inauguration was one of the most disappointing in American history, but he keeps desperately trying to sell it as one of the best.Actual attendance at Trump s inauguration didn t even get close to a million people as aerial photos show that much of the National Mall was empty by the time Trump delivered his divisive and negative inaugural address.Neilson television ratings for Trump s inauguration were not much better as 31 million tuned in to watch a national tragedy unfold before their eyes.But Trump is bragging about this number on Twitter and comparing it to President Obama s second inauguration ratings as if he thinks he deserves some sort of prize for cherry-picking an inauguration that got lower ratings.Wow, television ratings just out: 31 million people watched the Inauguration, 11 million more than the very good ratings from 4 years ago!  Donald J.

ACTOR WHO BLEW THROUGH $150 Million Fortune Is Worried Playing Ronald Reagan In Positive Light For Upcoming Movie Could Ruin His Career,"LOL! If I was Cage s manager, I d suggest he shut his mouth and act.Think your money troubles are bad? Trying blowing through $150 million, going broke, then owing the IRS $13 million. Yes, we re talking about Oscar-winning actor Nicolas Cage.Forbes listed him as one of the highest-paid actors of all time. It s said he made $40 million in 2009 alone. That s a lot of money!Unfortunately, the fun was short-lived. As his income increased, so did his insane buying habits.By the time he reached his mid-forties (he s now 53), Nicolas Cage spent so much cash that he put the King of Arabia to shame. While he blamed his money manager for sending him  down a path toward financial ruin,  others say it was his crazy personal spending.  Finance BuzzFast forward to today, where Nicholas Cage has been offered the role of Ronald Reagan in an upcoming film, but is reportedly voicing his concerns about how the former president will be portrayed in the picture.The Oscar-winning actor is said to be worried that it might damage his career if he plays Reagan in a flattering light reports Page Six.Cage s publicist, Stephen Huvane, dismissed that report however, saying:  It s way too early in the development process. Little else is known about the film at this time, including the director, screenwriter or who else might star alongside Cage, should he accept the part.

"YES, Obama CAN Appoint A Supreme Court Justice Before He Leaves…But Will He?","The President who has thumbed his nose at our US Constitution, and clearly has no respect for our rule of law, has the ability to appoint a Supreme Court Justice before he vacates the White House, but will he? In those few moments the Senate will go into what s known as an  intersession recess,  creating one golden moment when the president could test his recess-appointment powers by sending Judge Garland to the high court.A smattering of activists has asked him to give it a try, but Mr. Obama has given no indication that he s thinking about it. The White House didn t respond to a request for comment for this story.The move would be a legal gamble under the high court s last ruling in 2014 on recess appointments. That 9-0 decision overturned a handful of Mr. Obama s early 2012 picks, saying the Senate was actually in session when the president acted, so he couldn t use his powers.That ruling also said, however, that there s a difference between appointments made during the annual yearlong session of Congress, dubbed  intrasession,  which Mr. Obama used in 2012, and picks made at the end of the year, after Congress adjourns, which are known as  intersession. William G. Ross, a law professor at Samford University in Birmingham, Alabama, said Mr. Obama would have the power to elevate Judge Garland. But he said it would be  politically unwise and damaging to the prestige of the court. The consensus, though, is that Mr. Obama would be making a mistake to test it that theory. I think it s fair to use the word stretch. I don t know why he would try this. It would backfire,  said Louis Fisher, a scholar in residence at the Constitution Project who served for decades as Congress  top expert on separation-of-powers issues.He said Mr. Obama s 9-0 loss in the 2014 case should still be stinging someone who earned his law degree from Harvard University and taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago. Does he want to go down that road again?  Mr. Fisher said. Perhaps most problematic for Mr. Obama is that recess appointments have a shelf life. Even if he succeeds in putting Judge Garland on the bench, the appointment would expire at the close of 2017   and could end even earlier if the Senate confirms a full-fledged replacement named by Mr. Trump.Worse yet for Mr. Obama, Judge Garland would lose his seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit   oftentimes dubbed the second-most powerful court in the country. That means the president would be trading a lifetime of Judge Garland for less than a year of Justice Garland. Since Garland could serve only a year, he presumably would accomplish little and his service would be clouded by the strange and controversial circumstances of his appointment,  said Mr. Ross, the law professor.For entire story  Washington Times",politics,"Jan 2, 2017",2815
 Two Injured During Shoe-Sale Shootout At Suburban MN Mall (VIDEO),"Two people were injured during a shoe-sale shootout at the Brooklyn Shopping Center, in Madison, Minnesota on Saturday.According to witnesses, there was an altercation between customers who were waiting in line to purchase a pair of Air Jordans, which were on sale at the mall s Foot Locker.The New York Daily News reports that about sixty customers turned out for the shoe sale, but the store only had ten pairs of Air Jordans in stock.A brawl that apparently started after someone was accused of cutting in front of another customer in line, escalated into a shooting that injured two people. There was a little altercation over the shoes about someone in line. It was a lot of commotion. I don t know who was shooting, but somebody started shooting like six times,  said Latoya Sims, another witness to the shooting.The  little altercation  quickly escalated into a life-or-death scenario. According to police, at least a dozen shell casings were collected from the scene. It was absolutely crazy,  Latrissa Favorite, who was at Foot Locker at the time of the shooting, told WCCO-TV.  I heard police screaming  Get down, get down. Favorite went on to say, It makes you sad for the people and the mentality and mind frame that we have, that we have to kill somebody. That nobody s life is valued anymore. Saturday s shoe-sale shootout is just one of many recent incidents in which a gun was used as a means of settling what should have been a minor dispute.In January, Addicting Info reported on the deaths of a father and son at a gun store in Mississippi. The pair was killed after an argument over a $25 repair bill escalated into a shootout between two fathers and their two sons.In December we reported on a shootout between a Florida pastor and a church maintenance worker, that took place inside the Living Water Fellowship Church in Osceola. The maintenance worker was seriously injured during the gunfire exchange, which began after the pastor threatened to fire him.These kinds of incidents are much more common than you might think.Research conducted last year by Duke University Professor, Jeffrey Swanson, found that the vast majority of the 11,000 or so gun homicides that take place every year in the U.S., happen during an argument.As this detailed report from NCR points out, America s gun problem is twofold.First, there are a growing number of Americans who have serious anger issues. Second, there are a growing number of Americans with access to guns at all times, and in almost all places.When you combine angry people with accessible weapons, people get killed during trivial arguments.According to police, both victims of Saturday s mall shootout were treated for injuries that were not life threatening.They were lucky. Sadly, at least 11,000 U.S. citizens will not be fortunate enough to walk away from a shooting this year.Watch the video below, courtesy of WCCO in Minnesota.Image credit: video screen capture via WCCO in Minnesota",News,"March 6, 2016",2961
History Lesson: America’s Renegade Warfare,"Nicolas J S Davies Consortium NewsSeventy-seven million people in North and South Korea find themselves directly in the line of fire from the threat of a Second Korean War. The rest of the world is recoiling in horror from the scale of civilian casualties such a war would cause and the unthinkable prospect that either side might actually use nuclear weapons.Since the first Korean War killed at least 20 percent of North Korea s population and left the country in ruins, the U.S. has repeatedly failed to follow through on diplomacy to establish a lasting peace in Korea and has instead kept reverting to illegal and terrifying threats of war. Most significantly, the U.S. has waged a relentless propaganda campaign to discount North Korea s legitimate defense concerns as it confronts the threat of a U.S. war machine that has only grown more dangerous since the last time it destroyed North Korea.The North has lived under this threat for 65 years and has watched Iraq and Libya destroyed after they gave up their nuclear weapons programs. When North Korea discovered a U.S. plan for a Second Korean War on South Korea s military computer network in September 2016, its leaders quite rationally concluded that a viable nuclear deterrent is the only way to guarantee their country s safety.What does it say about the role the U.S. is playing in the world that the only way North Korea s leaders believe they can keep their own people safe is to develop weapons that could kill millions of Americans?The Changing Face of WarThe Second World War was the deadliest war ever fought, with at least 75 million people killed, about five times as many as in the First World War. When the slaughter ended in 1945, world leaders signed the United Nations Charter to try to ensure that that scale of mass killing and destruction would never happen again. The U.N. Charter is still in force, and it explicitly prohibits the threat or use of military force by any nation.It was not just the scale of the slaughter that shocked the world s leaders into that brief moment of sanity in 1945. It was also the identities of the dead. Two-thirds of the people killed in the Second World War were civilians, a drastic change from the First World War, only a few decades earlier, when an estimated 86 percent of the people killed were uniformed combatants. The use of nuclear weapons by the United States raised the specter that future wars could kill an exponentially greater numbers of civilians, or even end human civilization altogether.War had become  total war,  no longer fought only on battlefields between soldiers, but between entire societies with ordinary people, their homes and their lives now on the front line. In the Second World War: Fleets of warplanes deliberately bombed cities to dehouse civilian populations, as British officials described their own bombing of Germany. As I write this,  George Orwell wrote from London in 1941,  Highly civilized human beings are flying overhead, trying to kill me. Submarines sank hundreds of merchant ships in an effort to starve their enemies into submission. General Carter Clarke, who was in charge of interpreting Japanese intelligence for President Truman, said in a 1959 interview that Japan surrendered because it faced mass starvation due to the sinking of its merchant shipping, not because of the gratuitous U.S. nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It was estimated that 7 million more civilians would die of starvation if Japan fought on until 1946. Genocidal mass extermination campaigns killed civilians based only on their political affiliation or ethnicity. Under cross-examination by a young American prosecutor, Benjamin Ferencz, SS Gruppenfuhrer Dr. Otto Ohlendorf explained patiently to a courtroom in Nuremberg why he found it necessary for the  preemptive defense  of Germany to order the killing of hundreds of thousands of civilians. He explained that even children had to be killed to prevent them too becoming enemies of Germany when they grew up and found out what happened to their parents.Despite the U.N. Charter and international efforts to prevent war, people in countries afflicted by war today still face the kind of total war that horrified world leaders in 1945. The main victims of total war in our  modern  world have been civilians in countries far removed from the safe havens of power and privilege where their fates are debated and decided: Yugoslavia; Afghanistan; Iraq; Somalia; Pakistan; Yemen; Libya; Syria; Ukraine. There has been no legal or political accountability for the mass destruction of their cities, their homes or their lives. Total war has not been prevented, or even punished, just externalized.But thanks to billions of dollars invested in military propaganda and public relations and the corrupt nature of for-profit media systems, citizens of the countries responsible for the killing of millions of their fellow human beings live in near-total ignorance of the mass killing carried out in their name in these  red zones  around the world.People in ever-spreading war zones are living under the very conditions of total war that the world recoiled from at the end of the Second World War. Like Orwell in London in 1941, they hear highly civilized human beings flying overhead trying to kill them, human beings who know nothing about them beyond the name of the city where they live and its strategic value in wars that offer them, the victims, nothing but death or destitution.In the case of drones, the human beings trying to kill them from the other side of the world are so highly civilized that they can hop into cars and drive home to have dinner with their families at the end of their shifts, while another  team member  efficiently takes over the  joy-stick  and carries on killing.People in Yemen, Syria, Iraq and Libya have been subjected to hunger and starvation under sieges and naval blockades that are as brutally effective as German and American submarines were in World War Two. Millions of people in Yemen face an imminent danger of starvation under the U.S.-backed naval blockade and Saudi and Emirati bombing of Yemeni ports.In retaliation for one missile fired at Riyadh, the Saudi capital, last week, the U.S.-backed coalition completely closed all Yemen s ports, tightening the blockade on millions of starving people. The requirements of necessity and proportionality, which have been basic principles of customary international law since the Nineteenth Century, lie buried in the graveyards of Iraq and Afghanistan.Continue this article at Consortium News READ MORE WAR ON TERROR NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire War on Terror FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE  SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @ 21WIRE.TV",US_News,"November 17, 2017",6715

VATICAN ADVISOR: Says Pope Will Call On World At UN To Join Crusade For a New World Order…Would Like US To Pay $845 BILLION GLOBAL TAX To Combat ‘Climate Change’,"Members of the Catholic church need to pay close attention to the radical statements that are being made by the Vatican s top advisor, Jeffrey Sachs. Sachs has been described as  arguably the world s foremost proponent of population control,  including abortion.Top Vatican adviser Jeffrey Sachs says that when Pope Francis visits the United States in September, he will directly challenge the  American idea  of God-given rights embodied in the Declaration of Independence.Sachs, a special advisor to the United Nations and director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University, is a media superstar who can always be counted on to pontificate endlessly on such topics as income inequality and global health. This time, writing in a Catholic publication, he may have gone off his rocker, revealing the real global game plan.The United States, Sachs writes in the Jesuit publication, America, is  a society in thrall  to the idea of unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. But the  urgent core of Francis  message  will be to challenge this  American idea  by  proclaiming that the path to happiness lies not solely or mainly through the defense of rights but through the exercise of virtues, most notably justice and charity. In these extraordinary comments, which constitute a frontal assault on the American idea of freedom and national sovereignty, Sachs has made it clear that he hopes to enlist the Vatican in a global campaign to increase the power of global or foreign-dominated organizations and movements.Sachs takes aim at the phrase, which comes from America s founding document, the United States Declaration of Independence, that  We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. These rights sound good, Sachs writes, but they re not enough to guarantee the outcome the global elites have devised for us. Global government, he suggests, must make us live our lives according to international standards of development. In the United States,  Sachs writes,  we learn that the route to happiness lies in the rights of the individual. By throwing off the yoke of King George III, by unleashing the individual pursuit of happiness, early Americans believed they would achieve that happiness. Most important, they believed that they would find happiness as individuals, each endowed by the creator with individual rights. While he says there is some  grandeur in this idea,  such rights  are only part of the story, only one facet of our humanity. The Sachs view is that global organizations such as the U.N. must dictate the course of nations and individual rights must be sacrificed for the greater good. One aspect of this unfolding plan, as outlined in the Sachs book, The End of Poverty, involves extracting billions of dollars from the American people through global taxes. We will need, in the end, to put real resources in support of our hopes,  he wrote.  A global tax on carbon-emitting fossil fuels might be the way to begin. Even a very small tax, less than that which is needed to correct humanity s climate-deforming overuse of fossil fuels, would finance a greatly enhanced supply of global public goods.  Sachs has estimated the price tag for the U.S. at $845 billion.In preparation for this direct assault on our rights, the American nation-state, and our founding document, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon told a Catholic Caritas International conference in Rome on May 12 that climate change is  the defining challenge of our time,  and that the solution lies in recognizing that  humankind is part of nature, not separate or above. The pope s expected encyclical on climate change is supposed to help mobilize the governments of the world in this crusade.But a prestigious group of scholars, churchmen, scientists, economists, and policy experts has issued a detailed rebuttal, entitled,  An Open Letter to Pope Francis on Climate Change,  pointing out that the Bible tells man to have dominion over the earth. Good climate policy must recognize human exceptionalism, the God-given call for human persons to  have dominion  in the natural world (Genesis 1:28), and the need to protect the poor from harm, including actions that hinder their ascent out of poverty,  the letter to Pope Francis states.Released by a group called the Cornwall Alliance, the letter urges the Vatican to consider the evidence that climate change is largely natural, that the human contribution is comparatively small and not dangerous, and that attempting to mitigate the human contribution by reducing CO2 emissions  would cause more harm than good, especially to the world s poor. The Heartland Institute held a news conference on April 27 at the Hotel Columbus in Rome to warn the Vatican against embracing the globalist agenda of the climate change movement. The group is hosting the 10th International Conference on Climate Change in Washington, D.C., on June 11-12.However, it appears as if the Vatican has been captured by the globalist forces associated with Sachs and the United Nations.Voice of the Family, a group representing pro-life and pro-family Catholic organizations from around the world, has taken issue not only with the Vatican s involvement with Sachs, but with Ban Ki Moon, describing the two as  noted advocates of abortion who operate at the highest levels of the United Nations. Sachs has been described as  arguably the world s foremost proponent of population control,  including abortion.Voice of the Family charges that environmental issues such as climate change have become  an umbrella to cover a wide spectrum of attacks on human life and the family. Although Sachs likes to claim he was an adviser to Pope John Paul II, the noted anti-communist and pro-life pontiff, Sachs simply served as a member of a group of economists invited to confer with the Pontifical Council on Justice and Peace in advance of the release of a papal document.In fact, Pope John Paul II had worked closely with the Reagan administration in opposition to communism and the global population control movement. He once complained that a U.N. conference on population issues was designed to  destroy the family  and was the  snare of the devil. Pope Francis, however, seems to have embraced the very movements opposed by John Paul II.Sachs, who has emerged as a very influential Vatican adviser, recently tweeted that he was  thrilled  to be at the Vatican  discussing moral dimensions of climate change and sustainable development.  The occasion was a Vatican workshop on global warming on April 28, 2015, sponsored by the Pontifical Academy of Sciences of the Roman Catholic Church. Sachs was a featured speaker.The plan going forward involves the launching of what are called  Sustainable Development Goals,  as envisioned by a Sustainable Development Solutions Network run by none other than Jeffrey Sachs. The Network has proposed draft Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which contain provisions that are radically antagonistic to the right to life from conception to natural death, to the rights and dignity of the family and to the rights of parents as the primary educators of their children,  states the group Voice of the Family.In July, a Financing for Development conference will be held, in order to develop various global tax proposals, followed by a conference in Paris in December to complete a new climate change agreement.Before that December conference, however, Sachs says the pope will call on the world at the United Nations to join the crusade for a New World Order.Sachs says,  Pope Francis will come to the United States and the United Nations in New York on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the United Nations, and at the moment when the world s 193 governments are resolved to take a step in solidarity toward a better world. On Sept. 25, Pope Francis will speak to the world leaders most likely the largest number of assembled heads of state and government in history as these leaders deliberate to adopt new Sustainable Development Goals for the coming generation. These goals will be a new worldwide commitment to build a world that aims to harmonize the pursuit of economic prosperity with the commitments to social inclusion and environmental sustainability. Rather than emphasize the absolute need for safeguarding individual rights in the face of government overreach and power, Sachs writes that the Gospel teachings of humility, love, and justice,  like the teachings of Aristotle, Buddha and Confucius,  can take us on a  path to happiness through compassion  and  become our guideposts back to safety. Writing elsewhere in the new issue of America, Christiana Z. Peppard, an assistant professor of theology, science, and ethics at Fordham University, writes about the  planetary pope,  saying,  What is really at stake in the collective response to the pope s encyclical is not, ultimately, whether our treasured notions of theology, science, reality or development can accommodate moral imperatives. The real question is whether we are brave enough and willing to try. The plan is quite simple: world government through global taxes, with a religious face to bring it about.Via: Western Journalism",politics,"May 23, 2015",9363
ILLEGALS BEFORE AMERICAN CITIZENS: ACLU Sues 3 Missouri Colleges For Refusing Tuition Benefits To Illegal Aliens,"Obama s fundamental transformation of America s education system The American Civil Liberties Union is suing three public colleges in Missouri for denying in-state tuition to illegal immigrants, claiming that the law the schools are following is invalid.The Missouri chapter of the ACLU announced in a press release Tuesday that it has filed lawsuits against the University of Missouri, St. Louis Community College, and the Metropolitan Community College in Kansas City on behalf of three students who recently experienced tuition increases that the organization considers illegal.All three students are enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which grants immunity from deportation to individuals who arrived in the country illegally before the age of 16, but does not confer actual citizenship.The tuition hikes came after the state passed a bill this summer, HB 3, stating that  no funds shall be expended at public institutions of higher education that offer a tuition rate to any student with an unlawful immigration status in the United States that is less than the tuition rate charged to international students. Missouri law already prohibited public colleges and universities from providing institutional financial aid to students who are  unlawfully present in the United States,  but The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that some lawmakers had become concerned that the language would not apply to DACA students, prompting them to propose the new wording in an effort to clarify the law s meaning.Despite the misgivings of some administrators, the state s colleges dutifully complied, sending letters to affected students in July informing them of the mandated tuition increases even as some schools sought to offset the hikes with other forms of financial aid funded by private donations, which the law allows.Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon, however, offered a conflicting interpretation of the bill upon signing it into law, arguing that the language in question is not legally binding because it occurs in the preamble of the bill, rather than in the body. The Governor has been quite clear in order to change the law, you have to pass legislation,  press secretary Scott Holste told St. Louis Public Radio.  The language in the enacting clause of House Bill 3 or in the enacting clause of any other bill is not legally binding nor is it enforceable.  Via: Campus Reform",left-news,"Oct 19, 2015",2410
 Tonight’s ‘Saturday Night Live’ Is Sure To Make Trump Foam At The Mouth,"After a whole week off, and an emotional tribute from Hillary Clinton s portrayer, Kate McKinnon, Alec Baldwin will return to Saturday Night Live as Donald Trump. Baldwin s portrayal of Trump was one of the larger bright spots in an otherwise infuriating and frustrating election cycle, and now that Trump has won the election, Baldwin s reprisal should be a welcome break from all the hate and fear Trump has unleashed.SNL has actually taken quite a bit of flak for portraying Trump and Hillary as equally bad candidates. That will change now, and who knows how. SNL can be quite unpredictable, and given Trump s, ahem, ascendancy,  Weekend Update s  Colin Jost said: Now it seems easier, in a way, to tell jokes about what Trump s doing specifically because he s in power. If [the candidates] are talking about what they re going to do, it s harder to criticize it than when you start seeing what they re actually doing or not doing. Trump is making white supremacists and other extremists members of his administration right now. He won t like whatever SNL does with him unless Baldwin fawns over him, which is very unlikely. Barring a love fest from the show, Trump will probably downright hate it. He hated it before and tried to convince people that SNL was in on the efforts to rig the election against him:Watched Saturday Night Live hit job on me.Time to retire the boring and unfunny show. Alec Baldwin portrayal stinks. Media rigging election!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 16, 2016Maybe now he ll whine that they re trying to foment a rebellion or insurrection against him.Baldwin didn t play Trump the weekend following the election because he was booked, and because he s got small children at home. SNL takes a huge chunk out of his time that goes well into the following day. That doesn t mean he doesn t enjoy doing it   he just won t be doing it as much, though: I m going to do it again this weekend, but not all that often. There was a lot of things online that was said about it like why didn t I do it after the election?  he told Vanity Fair.  I was booked that weekend. Not even other jobs; we have things to do. But we all loved, you, Alec. You do Trump better than Trump does Trump.If you miss Alec Baldwin s portrayal of Trump, then tune into Saturday Night Live and see what he does. It should be pretty awesome.

NEW EMAILS REVEAL HUMA ABEDIN Told to “Show Love” to Clinton Donors…Clinton’s Brother Acted As Go-Between,"Judicial Watch has released documents obtained in response to a court order including emails that show a pay to play game going on between the Clintons and donors: A number of emails show the free flow of information and requests for favors between Clinton s State Department and the Clinton Foundation. What s even more disturbing is the lack of concern for national security in the heavily redacted emails:The heavily redacted documents from Abedin s non-government account include an email from Hillary Clinton s brother, Tony Rodham, to Abedin revealing that he acted as a go-between for a Clinton Foundation donor, Richard Park. And they reveal Clinton Foundation executive Doug Band instructing Abedin to  show love  to Clinton donor Andrew Liveris.The documents included six Clinton email exchanges not previously turned over to the State Department, bringing the known total to date to at least 439 emails that were not part of the 55,000 pages of emails that Clinton turned over to the State Department, and further contradicting a statement by Clinton that,  as far as she knew,  all of her government emails had been turned over to the State Department.The documents are in response to a court order from a May 5, 2015, lawsuit filed against the State Department (Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Department of State (No. 1:15-cv-00684)) for:  All emails of official State Department business received or sent by former Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin from January 1, 2009 through February 1, 2013 using a non- state.gov  email address. A number of emails show the free flow of information and requests for favors between Clinton s State Department and the Clinton Foundation.In July 2009, in reference to the US-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue, Clinton Global Initiative head Doug Band told Abedin that she  Need[s] to show love  to Andrew Liveris, the CEO of Dow Chemical. Band also asked for Liveris to be introduced to Hillary,  and have her mention both me and wjc . Dow gave between $1 million and $5 million to the Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative. Band also pushes for Clinton to do a favor for Karlheinz Koegel, a major Clinton Foundation contributor, who wanted Hillary Clinton to give the  honor speech  for his media prize to  Merkel. The emails reveal that on June 19, 2009, Clinton s brother, Tony Rodham, passed a long a letter for Hillary Clinton for Clinton donor Richard Park. Park donated $100,000 to Bill Clinton as far back as 1993 and is listed by the Clinton Foundation as a $100,000 to $250,000 donor Read more: Judicial Watch",politics,"Jul 20, 2017",2581
Hero Church Member With CCL Stops Sudanese Shooter Who Stormed Church in Tennessee Kills and Injures Churchgoers,"The main stream media is totally ignoring the horrific case of a Sudanese immigrant who stormed into a Tennessee church this morning and killed 1, injured several. Nashville Police have identified the suspect of a mass shooting at a church Sunday morning as 25-year-old Emanuel Kidega Samson.Samson is being charged with murder and multiple counts of attempted murder in the attack that killed one and left at least seven other people injured at the Burnette Chapel Church of Christ in Antioch, a town just south of Nashville, Tenn.IT COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH WORSE: One brave church member, 22-year-old Caleb Engle, confronted the Samson before being pistol whipped in the face. Engle then went to his car to retrieve a gun, which he has under a concealed carry license (CCL). Engle returned to the church to confront the gunman again.

 Disgusting Trump Is Using Hurricane As An Opportunity To Deport People,"A Category Four hurricane has hit Texas. It s set to be the most disastrous hurricane since Katrina hit Louisiana in 2005, yet Donald Trump is using it as an opportunity to deport people.Thousands of people are evacuating the affected areas, trying to beat the storm. Instead of helping ensure that evacuations go smoothly, the Trump administration is doing the exact opposite. They are creating checkpoints and forcing people to show their  papers  proving they are documented residents of the United States.The federal government is closing border patrol checkpoints in the path of the hurricane, but they re leaving checkpoints open outside the path. The Texas Tribune reports: Border Patrol checkpoints will not be closed unless there is a danger to the safety of the traveling public and our agents. Border Patrol resources, including personnel and transportation, will be deployed on an as needed basis to augment the efforts and capabilities of local-response authorities,  the agency said in a statement.The Border Patrol is a law enforcement agency and we will not abandon our law enforcement duties. I m sure you can imagine the consequences. Sure, checkpoints will only be open outside the path of the hurricane, but they can still cause traffic to back up for miles. It will also all but ensure that undocumented immigrants and their families will stay behind, only to be potentially killed by the hurricane or the resulting floods.Civil rights agencies like the ACLU are furious. This is a disgusting move from the Border Patrol that breaks with past practices,  American Civil Liberties Union director of immigration policy and campaigns Lorella Praeli said.  The Border Patrol should never keep checkpoints open during any natural disasters in the United States. Everyone, no matter the color of their skin or background, is worth saving. Everyone, no matter the color of their skin or background, is worth saving.  Except to Donald Trump, they really aren t. Trump doesn t care about anyone, but he does care about appeasing his racist, xenophobic base. John Edwards used to talk about two Americas. Today, we have the America that Donald Trump cares about (about 1/3 of the country) and we have the rest of us who could all die in the path of a hurricane for all he cares.Featured image via Pool/Getty Images.

Security scrambled and beat the piss out of the unidentified puncher.While all the attention was on the nasty rapper who got knocked out, the person who cold-cocked him on stage was pummeled by security. Is it part of the security detail s job to mob beat anyone who harms the performer they ve been hired to protect, or is it their job to capture and detain him until the proper authorities have arrived? Let s hope this guy who jumped on stage and gave this disgusting rapper a little dose of karma has a good lawyer because he needs to sue those security guards for using excessive force XX was eventually carried offstage.

 Carson Gives LAUGHABLE Reason Trump Won’t Discuss His Good Deeds,"Dr. Ben Carson has earned the dubious honor of refuting the idea that brain surgeon equals smart. It clearly doesn t, at least not beyond the operating table. Carson, who was beaten badly in the GOP primaries, is one of the few competitors who has given his full support to Donald Trump, although, if his latest comment is any indication, he s never actually met Trump or even heard him talk.On Morning Joe, Carson was asked a whole bunch of questions, with nearly zero follow-up. Carson, unchecked, lied about the economy and while he doesn t approve of the entire tone of Trump s campaign, he was allowed to make the claim that both sides do it.The most jaw-dropping part of the interview began at about 6:52 in when Morning Joe contributor Mike Barnacle asked Carson why Trump has such a hard time speaking to people about loss. He was referring to Trump s absolutely unsympathetic treatment of the Khans, who are a Gold Star family and who lost their son in Iraq. Carson denied that Trump was heartless. Please, for your computer s safety, swallow your drink before reading further.According to Carson, Trump is very compassionate and the only reason we don t hear about the good things he does for people is that   no, I did not make this up   Trump doesn t like self-praise. Yes, we re still talking about Donald Trump. I m then hopeful that he will begin to put to put out many of the stories that I am very familiar with, of things that he has done to help people who have been in very, very difficult situations. You know, he he feels that, you know, that s self-praising, he doesn t want to do it. Here s the video:Huh. Isn t that Carson right next to Trump during this debate last September, where Trump bragged enough about himself that someone made an entire video made of just Trump bragging? That s just one debate. If some brave soul attempted to go through all the election footage, the videos would go on for hours, if not days.Dr. Carson, there are plenty of things you can say about Donald Trump, and if you try hard enough, you might even find something that s not despicable, but modesty is certainly not one of them.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"August 5, 2016",2178

 Republican Leaders And Activists Plan To Back Third-Party Candidate If Trump Is Nominated,"Political contributor and conservative editor Erick Erickson, along with numerous Republican activists and leaders, are planning on rallying behind a third-party candidate should Donald Trump, the current GOP frontrunner, secure the nomination in July.Erickson, former editor of RedState, in a statement on his newest website The Resurgent titled  #UnelectableDonald Will Make America Blue Again,  said:As economic, defense, and faith conservatives, we oppose Donald Trump and will not vote for him in the coming general election. Our objective is two-fold: the election of a conservative president and averting the debacle of a Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders administration. To achieve these objectives, the candidacy of Donald Trump must be defeated.Slamming Trump over his  liberal  positions and his  authoritarian  approach, the group of leaders and activists pledged they would vote and, if they lose, carry on until the next fight:We will vote. Sitting out an election is not an option. The Republican Party has before it several candidates with the record and ability to serve as president with honor and distinction. In the coming months, we will devote ourselves to ensuring the nomination goes to a candidate who will strengthen our economy, national security and, above all, the conservative values on which all else depends. Should this effort fail, we will join with other faithful conservatives to find new candidates and institutions to carry on the fight for conservative principles and policies.This is he third meeting between Erikson and his band of plucky conservatives. In March, when the first meeting adjourned, the group called for the creation of Unity Ticket to thwart Trump, and as a second option opted for a third-party candidate should the Unity Ticket fail.Other members of Erickson s group, which totals about a dozen Republicans, includes columnist Quin Hillyer, George W. Bush adviser Bill Wichterman, and Mike Farris, a conservative activist and candidate for lieutenant governor in Virginia.Although Erickson s group is seemingly one of a kind, there have been numerous Republicans coming out to say they would refuse to vote for Trump, including Joe Scarborough (who at one point supported him), former Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, Dana Losech,  Mel Martinez, Sen. Ben Sasse and others. Featured image via Flickr",News,"April 13, 2016",2353
DETROIT SCHOOLS CHIEF Wants To Shut Down Charter Schools Ranked “Best In The State” To Focus On Public Schools Ranked “Worst Urban School District In Country”,"Liberal logic 101 The new superintendent for Detroit s public schools said he will recommend the school district no longer authorize charter schools and focus instead on improving its conventional schools, according to the Detroit Free Press. We have to get it right with traditional public schools and our focus, our energy, our resources need to be on that,  Superintendent Nikolai Vitti told the Free Press.Hechinger Report   Since 1994, there has been an extreme decline in Detroit Public Schools  enrollment: 73 percent. This has had a huge impact on the financial stability of the district and the performance of its remaining schools. However, the expansion of charter schools is just one reason for the decline in enrollment. During that same time, the overall population in the city declined by 33 percent. In addition, the district lost a considerable number of students to inter-district choice programs with neighboring school districts, which enroll more students statewide than charter schools.ForTheRecord says: Two charter schools authorized by Detroit s public schools were rated as the best in the state, according to a report card published by the Mackinac Center for Public Policy. The report card examined Michigan s middle and elementary schools and adjusted their rankings to reflect the impact of students  economic background.Detroit s Martin Luther King Jr. Education Center Academy was the top rated elementary and middle school in the state. Ross/Hill Academy was the second-best.Ironically, Detroit s public schools have been rated as the worst large urban school district in the country. In 2009, 2011, 2013 and 2015, the National Assessment of Education Progress did assessments and Detroit was rated as the worst in each time.Washington Examiner   According to a highly regarded study, in just one year Michigan charter school students earn an additional two months of learning gains over their traditional public school counterparts. For Detroit, charter students get an additional three months of learning in math and reading when compared to their traditional school peers.Most Michigan charter schools are authorized by state universities, and most conventional public school districts do not authorize any charters. Detroit is an exception, having authorized 14 charters.  Michigan Capitol Confidential",left-news,"Jul 11, 2017",2339
 The Trump Administration Is Helping Scam Universities Steal Money From Their Students,"Trump s Department of Education is delaying action on requests for student loan forgiveness from those whose money was stolen by the scams that are for-profit universities while they work to erase everything Obama tried to do to protect those very same students. The Trump administration, while claiming they re  draining the swamp,  has brought more of the swamp into the federal government than anyone, and the people working at DOE are sympathetic to these scam universities, not their victims.It s true that a lack of action isn t the same as telling students defrauded by these places that they ll have to continue making their payments or face the consequences. However, that same lack of action is harming students and their families who are on the hook for loans they took out on false promises they d be able to get good jobs with their degrees. They re now stuck in a limbo that s teetering towards the for-profit education scam.Corinthian Colleges and ITT Technical Institute both closed their doors under President Obama, who forgave more than $600 million in loans to their students. That s $600 million in stolen money for which students were off the hook. But that was Obama, who tried to do things that helped ordinary Americans even in the face of unprecedented GOP obstruction. Trump and his administration?Everything they do favors the few over the many, even when it includes stealing, which is what misrepresenting yourself and taking people s money based on that misrepresentation is.Trump himself has been sued more than once over his fraudulent  Trump University  because that program was literally nothing but lies built upon lies. Trump U. took people s money and gave them nothing in return. Other for-profit universities promise students jobs in their fields within just a few months of graduation, but charge exorbitant tuition and have a history of forcing students to forfeit their right to sue as well as making promises they can t back up.Obama tried to eliminate the arbitration clauses for-profit universities were forcing on their students. Betsy DeVos, Trump s education secretary, says that students shouldn t be the victims of fraud, but also said that certain standards protecting students were unfairly applied.So DOE is allegedly working to change that. But since Trump himself operated a scam university, it s only natural that he and his administration are going to see the profit side of things more than they will the defrauded-student side of things. Fraud is nothing more than another way to put dollars in their pockets, and it s clear that they d rather help scams rake in even more money than help real people.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"September 13, 2017",2704

"“DRIVE THEM OUT OF YOUR PLACES OF WORSHIP!” London Imams Take President Trump’s Advice, REFUSE To Perform Funeral Rights For Islamic Terrorists [VIDEO]","President Trump gave a powerful speech to Arab leaders at the opening of the new Global Centre for Combatting Extremist Ideology in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on May 21, 2017. In his historic speech, President Trump warned Islamic extremists:  If you choose terror, your life will be brief and your life will be empty.  Trump went on to tell the Arab leaders and the entire world, We are not here to lecture and tell you how to live. We are here to work together to meet one goal and meet history s great test to conquer extremism. Young Muslim boys and girls should be able to grow up free from fear, safe from violence and innocent of hatred. Young Muslims should be able to build prosperity for themselves. This will be the beginning of the end for those who fight terror. This special gathering will one day be remembered as the start of peace in the Middle East and potentially all over the world. Watch the clip of President Trump telling Arab leaders in Riyadh and around the world to  drive out terrorism  from their nations and from their places of worship:It appears that the Imams in London were listening after East London Mosque and London Muslim Centre Chairman Muhammad Habibur-Rahman boldly announced to Muslims everywhere that if they commit acts of terror against innocent people, they will not receive funeral rights in London mosques.British police on Tuesday named the final member of the terror trio that murdered seven people on Saturday in a knife and van attack before police shot the jihadis dead   and the news comes as more than 130 Muslim religious leaders were refusing to say funeral prayers for any members of the ISIS cell.The decision by the Muslim leaders was seen as an  unprecedented  move because the funeral ritual is typically performed on a deceased Muslim no matter the person s past actions. The group of religious leaders have urged others to join them in declining to pray for the dead killers. We, as Muslim imams and religious leaders, condemn the recent terror attacks in Manchester and London in the strongest terms possible,  the Muslim leaders said in a statement.  Coming from a range of backgrounds, and from across the U.K.; feeling the pain the rest of the nation feels, we have come together to express our shock and utter disgust at these cold-blooded murders. We are deeply hurt that a spate of terror attacks have been committed in our country once more by murderers who seek to gain religious legitimacy for their actions. We seek to clarify that their reprehensible actions have neither legitimacy nor our sympathy. East London Mosque and London Muslim Centre Chairman Muhammad Habibur-Rahman said the decision was made because  those who perpetrate terrorism: you are against the very core teaching of Islam and of our Prophet Muhammad. Your misguidance will lead you to destruction, and God willing you will utterly fail in your evil aims,  he said in a statement.The decision underscores a warning President Trump issued to the Islamic world last month. Speaking in Riyadh before the leaders of 50 Muslim majority countries, Trump told warned terrorists that taking innocent lives would not lead to eternal paradise. If you choose the path of terror, your life will be empty, your life will be brief, and your soul will be fully condemned,  Trump said.U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also applauded the move. He said he was encouraged by the imams and said that the decision means  they re condemning their souls  since the funeral prayer asks for forgiveness of the dead. And that is what has to be done,  he said.Youssef Zaghba, a Moroccan-born Italian man, was identified Tuesday morning as the final member of the trio that descended upon the London Bridge on Saturday.Mak Chishty, the Metropolitan police commander of engagement, said, according to The Guardian, that it is time for Muslims to  counter the scourge of terrorism, extremism and hatred that we have in our communities at present. Chishty, the highest-ranking officer in the department of Muslim faith, said,  It is the Islamic duty of every Muslim to be loyal to the country in which they live. We are now asking questions to understand how extremism and hatred has taken hold within some elements of our own communities.   FOX News ",politics,"Jun 6, 2017",4266
DEATH PANELS? PRINCETON PROFESSOR WANTS TO KILL DISABLED BABIES And Wants Obamacare To Pay For It,"Hell has a special spot reserved for this horrible man According to an article published Sunday by World Net Daily, a Princeton University professor has suggested that severely disabled infants be killed to cut health care costs and for moral reasons. In a radio interview Sunday with Aaron Klein, broadcast on New York s AM 970 The Answer and Philadelphia s NewsTalk 990 AM, Princeton University ethics professor Peter Singer argued it is  reasonable  for government or private insurance companies to deny treatment to severely disabled babies.Several times during the interview Singer argued the health-care system under Obamacare should openly acknowledge health-care rationing and that the country should acknowledge the necessity of  intentionally ending the lives of severely disabled infants.  Singer also repeatedly referred to a disabled infant as  it  during the interview.According the WND, Singer is well-known for his controversial views on abortion and infanticide. He essentially argues the right to life is related to a being s capacity for intelligence and to hold life preferences, which in turn is directly related to a capacity to feel and comprehend pain and pleasure.Singer told Klein rationing is already happening, saying doctors and hospitals routinely make decisions based on costs. Klein is the host of  Aaron Klein Investigative Radio,  a syndicated radio program that airs in several markets across the US. Klein is also a columnist at WND. It s different in the U.S. system, in a way, because it doesn t do this overtly; maybe it doesn t do it as much,  Singer explained.  And the result is it spends about twice as much on health care as some other countries for very little extra benefit in terms of the outcome. During the interview Klein quoted from a section of Singer s 1993 treatise  Practical Ethics,  titled  Taking Life: Humans.  In the section, Singer argued for the morality of  non-voluntary euthanasia  for human beings not capable of understanding the choice between life and death, including  severely disabled infants, and people who through accident, illness, or old age have permanently lost the capacity to understand the issue involved. Singer contends that the wrongness of killing a human being is not based on the fact that the individual is alive and human. Instead, Singer argues it is  characteristics like rationality, autonomy, and self-consciousness that make a difference.  When asked by Klein whether he envisions denying treatment to disabled infants to become more common in the US under the new health-care law, Singer replied:  It does happen. Not necessarily because of costs. If an infant is born with a massive hemorrhage in the brain that means it will be so severely disabled that if the infant lives it will never even be able to recognize its mother, it won t be able to interact with any other human being, it will just lie there in the bed and you could feed it but that s all that will happen, doctors will turn off the respirator that is keeping that infant alive. I don t know whether they are influenced by reducing costs,  Singer continued.  Probably they are just influenced by the fact that this will be a terrible burden for the parents to look after, and there will be no quality of life for the child. So we are already taking steps that quite knowingly and intentionally are ending the lives of severely disabled infants. And I think we ought to be more open in recognizing that this happens. Klein then asked singer,  I know that it happens and it happens certainly if the family gives consent. But do you think in the future in order to ensure a more fair rationing of health-care and health-care costs, that it should actually be instituted more? The killing of severely disabled babies? Singer responded by saying the killing of infants would be  quite reasonable  if it saved money that can be used for better purposes. He contended that most people would say they don t want their premiums to be higher  so that infants who can experience zero quality of life can have expensive treatments. Singer s full response: I think if you had a health-care system in which governments were trying to say,  Look, there are some things that don t provide enough benefits given the costs of those treatments. And if we didn t do them we would be able to do a lot more good for other people who have better prospects, then yes.I think it would be reasonable for governments to say,  This treatment is not going to be provided on the national health service if it s a country with a national health service. Or in the United States on Medicare or Medicade. And I think it will be reasonable for insurance companies also to say,  You know, we won t insure you for this or we won t insure you for this unless you are prepared to pay an extra premium, or perhaps they have a fund with lower premiums for people who don t want to insure against that. Because I think most people, when they think about that, would say that s quite reasonable. You know, I don t want my health insurance premiums to be higher so that infants who can experience zero quality of life can have expensive treatments.

 The Bundys Are Suing Because They Can’t Have Guns….In Jail,"No one has ever accused the Bundy boys of being intelligent. Their grasp on reality is a little sketchy, as is pretty much everything they do. They are the poster children for entitlement   expecting the government to give them free stuff (cattle grazing land), and then when the government charges them, they take over a bird sanctuary in Oregon. Now, they are pissed that after they broke numerous laws, their rights are being stripped away, just like everyone else who s in jail.Ammon and Ryan Bundy, sons of Cliven Bundy, are suing the Multnomah County Sheriff s Office. Some of their complaints don t seem completely ridiculous. They want more access to the law library, discovery material and office supplies. They also feel that the jail hasn t been accommodating enough to their Mormon religion. But it s not all sane, at all.UNSPECIFIED LOCATION   JANUARY 26: (EDITORS NOTE: Best quality available) In this composite with handout images provided by the Multnomah County Sheriff s Office, suspects (Top L) Ammon Bundy, Ryan Bundy, Ryan Waylen Payne, Brian Cavalier, (Bottom L) Peter Santilli, Joseph Donald OShaughnessy , and Shawna Cox pose for a mugshot photo after being arrested by U.S. Marshalls January 26, 2016 in Oregon.

Bundy led a group of armed followers, adopting the name Citizens for Constitutional Freedom, and occupied the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. (Photo by Multnomah County Sheriff s Office via Getty Images) My rights are being violated. My right to life is being violated. All of my First Amendment rights are being violated. My right to freedom of religion is being violated,  Ryan Bundy wrote in a supporting statement.  My Second Amendment rights are being violated. I never waived that right. My Fourth Amendment rights are being violated.Wait, what? The Bundys are complaining because they re not allowed to have their guns, in jail!? Oh, and that search and seizure stuff that they tend to do in jail is very tiresome.Believe it or not, the jail hasn t completely laughed off all the Bundy complaints. They have given them more access to the library and they are considering giving them access to a computer of some sort. MCSO is willing to consider permitting inmates to have a solid-state device like an iPad, loaded with discovery including video, legal materials and a word-processing program to be made available to the person only in his cell,  jail officials responded to the request.Just imagine one moment that the Bundys were Muslim instead of Mormon. 9/11 suspects were accused of having laptops, while in Gitmo, according to the unreliable Washington Times.As for the religious gatherings, the jail put their foot down. They wanted to gather together, wearing temple garments beneath their jail clothes. The jail was worried about them gathering, but they did allow them an extra towel for kneeling to pray and they are allowed to wear their religious garments.The jail also refused to give them access to the internet, chairs in their cells, access to other defendants, unmonitored phone calls, a cordless printer and scanner, more storage space and real pens. Come on, anyone who s every watched a prison movie knows that real pens are killers.Not a single one of the jail s concessions have been enough, according to the Bundys. They are considering suing. Here s a copy of the complaint. The Bundys are accused of 16 federal felonies. If they are convicted, they will never be able to own a gun again, not that that will stop them.Featured image via Justin Sullivan with Getty Images",News,"May 26, 2016",3687
NEW YORK MAN SHOCKED To Discover Who Was Stealing His Trump Signs: ‘This is supposed to be the United States’,"A New York man was stunned this week to find out who stole his Donald Trump yard signs   the former vice president of academic affairs at a local college.Charlie Tulumello of Amherst put recording equipment in his yard after pro-Trump yard signs kept disappearing in the middle of the night. Seven signs in total disappeared before the culprit   former Keuka College administrator Norman Muir   was finally caught.  The first ones I thought maybe they were kids, pranks,  Mr. Tulumello told a local CBS News affiliate Monday.  This is supposed to be the United States of America. Free speech. Those things are not supposed to be done.  Mr. Tulumello told the station that his wife was  uneasy  at night as the theft continued, so he put up a special sign warning people to stay off his property.  Didn t work. This fella just kept coming,  the New Yorker said.  I was aggravated, angry. This person comes up on my property in the middle of the night. You don t know what to think.

 GOP Operative Connected To Trump’s Ousted Top Adviser Tried Obtaining Russian-Hacked Clinton Emails,"An explosive report in the Wall Street Journal explicitly links the Russian-hacked Clinton campaign emails with Trump s campaign   and Michael Flynn s chances of ending up in prison just skyrocketed.According to the report, a GOP operative, Peter Smith, who had worked with Flynn s consulting group asked computer experts to help him get a hold of the cache of hacked emails the Russian government stole from Clinton s campaign. To open doors to getting what he wanted, he name-dropped Michael Flynn, who at that point was working on Trump s campaign. Smith died recently, but not before handing the Wall Street Journal a bedside confession of sorts.Talking Points Memo summarizes the insane details of the scheme:In one recruiting email reviewed by the newspaper, Smith said Flynn s son, Michael G. Flynn, was helping with the effort. In another, Jonathan Safron, a law student who worked for Smith, included Flynn s consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group, at the top of a list of websites of people working with the team. He said,  I m talking to Michael Flynn about this if you find anything, can you let me know?  Eric York, one computer security expert who said he searched hacker forums on Smith s behalf to try to dig up the emails, told the Journal.Here s where the other shoe drops, via WSJ:Those investigators have examined reports from intelligence agencies that describe Russian hackers discussing how to obtain emails from Mrs. Clinton s server and then transmit them to Mr. Flynn via an intermediary, according to U.S. officials with knowledge of the intelligence.It isn t clear who that intermediary might have been or whether Mr. Smith s operation was the one allegedly under discussion by the Russian hackers. The reports were compiled during the same period when Mr. Smith s group was operating, according to the officials.Trump actively encouraged Russian hackers to steal Clinton s documents during the campaign, but later claimed to not have anything to do with their release. Despite the denials, a mountain of circumstantial evidence and a number of questionable admissions from Trump s team have only stoked the flames that something was very wrong during the election. Much of his staff, including Vice President Mike Pence and Trump s own personal lawyer, have hired defense attorneys in preparation for the investigation into their involvement.This new information only further incriminates Flynn, who now goes from looking  pretty guilty  to  very guilty.  It also burns the last remaining bridges he may have had to save himself.Michael Flynn has toyed with taking a deal to turn on his former boss, but the FBI says it is not pursuing that relationship. There is a good possibility that, if these allegations bear fruit, Flynn winds up in jail for treason or something close to it.Now all eyes have turned to Trump himself, who seems consumed with protecting Flynn. By his own retelling, Trump fired then FBI Director, James Comey, because he wouldn t stop the Russia investigation. Comey has since testified that Trump specifically asked him to drop any investigation into Flynn (who has by now retroactively filed as a foreign agent working for Turkey s despotic regime).Spies, hackers, foreign agents, liars, thieves, and crooks   quite a group assembled by Trump, the man who only hires the best people.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"June 29, 2017",3376
READY FOR FINANCIAL CRISIS ROUND TWO? HOW CRONY CAPITALISM AND CENTRAL PLANNING HAVE DRAINED US,"This is the definition of insanity-doing the same thing over and over. We just need a Congress strong enough to stop the madness.For over 30 years, sovereign nations, particularly in the West have been buying votes by offering social payments in the form of welfare.The ridiculousness of this should not be lost on anyone. Politicians, in order to be elected, promise to allocate taxpayer funds on social programs that will benefit said taxpayers down the road (we re simply talking about social spending, not infrastructure or other costs).The concept that taxpayers might simply just keep the money to begin with never enters the equation. And because everyone believes that they are somehow spending someone else s money, they play along.When you believe that you are spending someone else s money, it s very easy to write a blank check, which is precisely what Western nations have been doing for years, promising everyone a safe and secure retirement without ever bothering to see where the money would come from.When actual bills came due to fund this stuff, Governments quickly discovered that current tax revenues couldn t cover it  so they issued sovereign debt to make up the difference.And so the bond bubble was created.The large banks, that have a monopoly on managing sovereign debt auctions, were only too happy to play along with this. The reasons are as follows:1) They can use these alleged  risk-free  assets as collateral to backstop tens of trillions worth of derivatives trades. A $1 million investment in your typical US Treasury can backstop over $15 million worth of derivatives if not more. The profits from the derivatives markets remains a primary source of revenue for the banks.2) Sovereign Governments are only too happy to bail out the big banks if the stuff ever hits the fan on the trades that are backstopped by the sovereign debt (see 2006 onwards). Since the banks are the ones holding the sovereign debt, they can always threaten to dump bonds, which would render the whole social welfare Ponzi bankrupt (see what happened in Europe when sovereign bonds collapsed in 2011-2012).3) In a debt-based financial system such as the current one, sovereign bonds are the senior most assets in the system. Those who own these in bulk are at the top of the financial food chain in terms of financial, economic, and political clout.Since it was rarely if ever a problem to issue sovereign debt, Governments kept promising future payments that they didn t have until we reach today: the point at which most Western nations are sporting Debt to GDP ratios well north of 300% when you consider unfunded liabilities (the social spending programs mentioned earlier).Now, cutting social spending is usually considered political suicide (after all, the voters put you in office in the first place based on you promising to pay them welfare payments down the road). So rather than default on the social contract made with voters, the political class will simply push to issue MORE debt to finance old debt that is coming due.The US did precisely this in the fourth quarter of 2014, issuing over $1 trillion in new debt simply to pay back old debt that was coming due.Read more: Zero Hedge",Government News,"May 8, 2015",3207
 These Hilarious Donald Trump Impressions Prove That Other Candidates Hate Him Just As Much As We Do (VIDEOS),"Republican front-runner Donald Trump does a pretty amazing job making himself look like a complete moron, but he s given us so much material that impersonating such a ridiculous candidate has never been more fun.Trump s a character that almost seems too insane to be real. From his accent to his hand gestures and facial expressions, we ve never had a more animated presidential candidate   and that might not be a good thing. He s become loathed by not only every logically thinking American, but by nearly every politician   even members of the Republican party!Because of his distinct (and revolting) personality, Trump has been impersonated by comedians, talk show hosts and more. Mimicking this candidate is so entertaining that even politicians   his own rivals   can t help but get in on it! Here are some epic impersonations that have been done by the other candidates, at Trump s expense:Hillary Clinton (starting at the 3:00 mark)We think Clinton took the prize here, doing a dead-on impersonation of the annoying yet unforgettable way Trump speaks. She even got some of the facial expressions right!Following Clinton are the impressions done by Trump s GOP rivals, who are understandably less charismatic and less intelligent than Clinton, but they still deserve some credit for trying   even if you end up laughing at them instead.Ted Cruz (at the 1:00 mark)Ted Cruz is creepy as ever, but he does a good job at summing up what Trump does during debates while at the same time mocking him for skipping one.Jeb Bush (at the 1:00 mark)You can tell that Jeb Bush, who recently dropped out of the presidential race, isn t used to being funny   but even he could barely contain his laughter as he tried to capture Trump s personality in a few seconds for Stephen Colbert.Rand Paul (at the :40 mark)Ex-candidate Rand Paul actually tried to mimic Trump s voice, and it was pretty disastrous. However, he did a great job reflecting Trump s misogynistic attitude toward women, as well as the front runner s inflated ego.Chris Christie Another former candidate, Chris Christie, takes a stab at Trump s voice as he bashes him during a speech. Interestingly enough, Christie has now endorsed Trump and was recently embarrassed tremendously by the business mogul   probably for this horrible impression.While these politicians should have probably left the impersonations to the comedians, we can t blame them for wanting to make fun of everyone s least favorite person. We can only imagine what it s like to work so closely with someone as irritatingly awful as Trump   so these candidates can blast him all they want. But in closing, we ll leave you with this epic Trump impersonation from Jimmy Fallon, who absolutely nailed it:Featured image is a screenshot",News,"March 4, 2016",2760
SANDERS SUPPORTERS Ready To Raise Hell At DNC After E-mail Leaks Prove Dems Stole Election From Bernie,"Wow! What a week for the Democrats! Nothing like the truth to bring the Dems to their knees! With the start of the DNC Convention, it s looking like the Bernie supporters are going to put on a huge demonstration. This ll be interesting since their chairwoman has been ousted and Hillary just hired her. And they said the Republicans are divided? This gathering of leftists will show us what  divided  looks like get ready for chaos!PHILADELPHIA   The Democrats  convention kicking off Monday still faces the potential for rowdy protests from Bernie Sanders delegates and supporters, despite the ouster of Democratic National Committee leader Debbie Wasserman Schultz serving as somewhat of a peace offering to liberal factions of the party that have accused her of tipping the scales for Hillary Clinton.Sanders supporters were angry over leaked emails that show the Florida congresswoman and her team blasting Sanders and discussing ways to undermine him.While her resignation could calm that storm, the liberal wing still appears intent on protesting over other grievances including Clinton, the party s presumptive presidential nominee, picking Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia as her running mate.Norman Solomon, a Sanders delegate from California, said Sunday that Clinton picking a centrist like Kaine is an  assault  on the progressive agenda. He said the roughly 1,250 Sanders delegates connected to his Bernie Delegates Network are considering walking out during the Virginia senator s expected acceptance speech at the Wells Fargo Center, and they are even looking into contesting his nomination.Via: FOX",politics,"Jul 25, 2016",1608
 WATCH: Marco Rubio Says Trump Will ‘Have To Answer’ For Wiretapping Lies,"Donald Trump s list of allies is getting shorter because of his outrageous accusation against President Obama.During the campaign, Marco Rubio fiercely opposed Trump but soon chose to kiss his ass and endorse him.Rubio has been reluctant to say anything against Trump ever since, but that changed over the weekend after Trump openly accused President Obama of wiretapping Trump Tower in a Saturday morning Twitter rant.Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my  wires tapped  in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017Trump offered zero evidence to back up his claims and both former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and current FBI Director James Comey have forcefully refuted Trump s accusation.And now Rubio, who is on the Senate Intelligence Committee, says that Trump will have to answer for his lies. I have no evidence and no one has presented anything to me that indicates anything like that,  Rubio told Meet The Press on Sunday.  Suffice it to say I don t have any basis, I ve never heard that allegation made before by anybody. I ve never seen anything about that anywhere before. But again, the president put that out there, and now the White House will have to answer as to exactly what he was referring to. Chuck Todd went on t ask Rubio if he would concede that if Trump is lying that it would be a huge political scandal and Rubio agreed.Here s the video via YouTube:Trump is desperate to distract everyone from focusing on his ever-growing Russia scandal, so he made up this lie based on a conspiracy theory he read on Breitbart in the hopes that Congress and the media will shift their focus.This is a serious accusation against a former president and Trump should be severely punished for it. He has offered no evidence to prove his claim and that means he is slandering President Obama, which should result in a lawsuit and impeachment. But we all know that Republicans in Congress have zero credibility so they will more than likely shield Trump and pursue a witch hunt against Obama, who was a more honorable and respected president than Trump will ever be.Featured image via screenshot",News,"March 6, 2017",2392

Doesn t that tell us so much about what the Democrats are up to? Who runs the US? Apparently George Soros.The liberal billionaire funder, who has been tied to a globalist elite pushing the Muslim migrant crisis and multiculturalism onto Western societies, comes up a lot in private discussions between top Hillary Clinton campaign officials.A search by American Lookout showed Soros has been mentioned at least 56 times throughout the 11 batches of emails put out by Wikileaks which show collusion between elites, the mainstream media and the Hillary campaign.Likewise, Soros was directly mentioned in multiple subject headlines on emails, often times requesting a meeting with top Clinton official, John Podesta.Take a look:There s even one email where the Clinton operatives speak of Hillary wanting to please Soros. Who the hell is in charge here?

TUCKER CARLSON Shocked At Lawyer’s Delusion On Rejection Of Voter ID Law In Texas [Video],"A Texas federal judge appointed by Obama has again rejected the 2011 Texas voter ID law, stating that the legislators meant to discriminate against minority voters.Tucker Carlson interviewed one of the lawyers involved in the case. The reasoning is beyond flawed! The only people being discriminated against are the LEGAL voters of this nation! Why is this activist judge assuming that minorities are being discriminated against? You will find her reasoning to be biased and racist. The Court of Appeals even came back with this statement:  some of the evidence used by the judge wasn t relevant. U.S. District Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos made this same ruling in 2014, which forced an appeal. The Fifth Circuit issued a stay against the order. The Supreme Court stepped in and allowed Texas to use the voter ID law.But last July the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans asked the judge  to re-examine the decision  since the judges found that  some of the evidence used by the judge wasn t relevant.  The two sides reached a deal for the 2016 election, which allowed a voter to  sign a declaration swearing that he or she has had a reasonable difficulty that prevented obtaining one of the accepted forms of photo identification. Ramos went back to the drawing board but came to the same conclusion.The Texas Tribune reported:After weighing the evidence again, she came to the same conclusion, according to Monday s ruling. Her decision did not identify what some have called a smoking gun showing intent to discriminate, but it cited the state s long history of discrimination;  virtually unprecedented radical departures from normal practices  in fast-tracking the 2011 bill through the Legislature; the legislation s  unduly strict  terms; and lawmakers   shifting rationales  for passing a law that some said was needed to crack down on voter fraud. The Court holds that the evidence found  infirm  did not tip the scales,  Ramos wrote. Civil rights groups and others suing the state offered evidence that  established a discriminatory purpose was at least one of the substantial or motivating factors behind passage of SB 14,  she added.The law requires a voter to use  one of seven forms of identification  when they vote. The voter can use a driver s license, concealed handgun license, military ID, passport, or a state-issued personal ID card.Democrats and civil rights activists claimed the  Republican legislators departed from procedural norms in passing the law, including classifying it as emergency legislation, cutting debate short and bypassing the ordinary committee process in both chambers. But Republican officials, which includes Governor Greg Abbott, insists the law stops voter ID and strengthens the integrity of elections.From The New York Times:They said that the law was aimed at preventing voter fraud and that the departures from the normal legislative process were made to prevent Democratic lawmakers from manipulating procedural rules to thwart passage. They maintained that opponents had turned up no evidence that any legislator had intended to discriminate against blacks and Hispanics.Texas lawmakers have not announced how they ll respond, but they can choose to appeal again.Fox News reported:Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton did not immediately react to the ruling, although the state could once again appeal, which is what one of Paxton s top deputies appeared to suggest would happen while testifying to lawmakers just as the ruling came down. Brantley Starr, a deputy first assistant attorney general, acknowledged that Texas could be dragged back under preclearance but noted there was little precedent. It s possible. It s our belief that you d have to have multiple instances of discriminatory purpose,  he said. ",politics,"Apr 11, 2017",3785
" The Oregonian Calls Out Racist Commenters, Racist Commenters Explode (IMAGES)","Racism is pretty prevalent on the interwebs. Generally, if an article even mentions something to do with Black culture, the racists are out in force. This happened so frequently on articles regarding hip-hop and the like on the Oregonian, which is, by the way, the west coast s largest paper, that one of their writers decided to address the problem of racism in their comments sections.The piece, entitled  Dear Readers: Stop Being Racist About Hip Hop, rips the racists in the comments sections to shreds. The writer of the article, David Greenwald, first talks about how he is no longer shocked at the racism he encounters, even on the supposedly liberal west coast, then goes on to treat his readers to a sampling of the racism in his comments sections, and even in his email inbox:I got an email over the weekend about our recent Kanye West stories. No subject. It didn t need one.  This is news?  the reader wrote.  About some n  rapping?  Every time the Oregonian covers hip-hop music, a rich and beautiful American art form invented to share the pain and joys and narratives of inner-city black lives over 30 years ago, readers comment with hatred. Here, from Monday night alone, enjoy a few choice notes about Kendrick Lamar, the most important musician currently working in American music and new winner of five glimmering Grammy awards: Best  rap album? That, my friends, is a world class oxymoron,  Yardbird tells us. Not since Kanye West, has an individual with so little talent, been so worshiped and idolized by so many. Even a superstar like Adelle has been sucked into this clown s,  Music,'  DonRon adds. Adele is spelled with one  L : she is also a blues singer who owes everything to the African-American creativity that birthed hip-hop.And that s just for starters. Greenwald then goes on to try to educate the ignoramuses that make up so much of his readership on the beauty and riches that hip-hop culture has given America. However, at the end of the day, he says he understands that he cannot school people determined to be so ignorant. He ends the piece by saying: If you dismiss hip-hop culture, if you paint it all with the same ignorant brush, if you say  hip-hop masterpiece  is an oxymoron, if Beyonc  and Kendrick Lamar and Kanye West are just too black: you are a racist and you are wrong, and this will be the last time I write for you. And good for him. Unsurprisingly, the very racists who need to take what Mr. Greenwald is saying into account completely missed the point of the article, and responded with   gasp!   more racism. First, there were the ones whose response was to disparage the writer and the work of the hip hop artists, all the while using racist language:Then, of course, there was that one person who just had to pop out and declare themselves an expert on all things black because he once knew a black person:And of course, those are just what is there as of this writing, with the article being quite new. I am sure the ugly and ignorance will continue. Unfortunately, though, at the end of the day, the very people who needed to hear David Greenwald s message have turned a deaf ear, and will remain as ignorant as they were prior to reading his brilliant piece.Featured image from video screen capture from The Oregonian",News,"February 16, 2016",3280

MEDIA IGNORES Time That Bill Clinton FIRED His FBI Director On Day Before Vince Foster Was Found Dead,"In its 109-year history, only one F.B.I. director had been fired   until Tuesday, when President Trump fired James B. Comey. In July 1993, President Bill Clinton fired William S. Sessions, who had been nominated to the post by President Ronald Reagan in 1987. Mr. Clinton said his attorney general, Janet Reno, reviewed Mr. Sessions s leadership and concluded  in no uncertain terms that he can no longer effectively lead the bureau. Mr. Sessions had been cited for ethical lapses, including taking free trips on F.B.I. aircraft and using government money to build a $10,000 fence at his home. Mr. Sessions was asked to resign, and was fired when he refused to do so.  Despite the president s severe tone, he seemed to regret having to force Mr. Sessions from his post,  The New York Times wrote about his dismissal:WASHINGTON, July 19  President Clinton today dismissed William S. Sessions, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who had stubbornly rejected an Administration ultimatum to resign six months after a harsh internal ethics report on his conduct.Mr. Clinton said he would announce his nominee to replace Mr. Sessions on Tuesday. He was expected to pick Judge Louis J. Freeh of Federal District Court in Manhattan; officials said Judge Freeh had impressed Mr. Clinton favorably on Friday at their first meeting.Mr. Clinton, explaining his reasons for removing Mr. Sessions, effective immediately, said,  We cannot have a leadership vacuum at an agency as important to the United States as the F.B.I. It is time that this difficult chapter in the agency s history is brought to a close.  Defiant to the EndBut in a parting news conference at F.B.I. headquarters after Mr. Clinton s announcement, a defiant Mr. Sessions   his right arm in a sling as a result of a weekend fall   railed at what he called the unfairness of his removal, which comes nearly six years into his 10-year term. Because of the scurrilous attacks on me and my wife of 42 years, it has been decided by others that I can no longer be as forceful as I need to be in leading the F.B.I. and carrying out my responsibilities to the bureau and the nation,  he said.  It is because I believe in the principle of an independent F.B.I. that I have refused to voluntarily resign. Mr. Clinton said that after reviewing Mr. Sessions s performance, Attorney General Janet Reno had advised him that Mr. Sessions should go.  After a thorough review by the Attorney General of Mr. Sessions s leadership of the F.B.I., she has reported to me in no uncertain terms that he can no longer effectively lead the bureau. Similarly, Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey on the recommendation of his attorney general, Jeff Sessions. (No relation to William S. Sessions.) There are no United States statutes that discuss the president s authority to remove the F.B.I. director.   NYT s Vince Foster: What the Media Won t Tell You Major media outlets reported Wednesday on the Supreme Court hearing of California lawyer Allan Favish s case that government photographs of Vincent Foster s death scene be released for public viewing. The media report that no fewer than five investigations have found that Foster committed suicide because he was depressed. But despite 10 years of denial by the major media, the Foster case has not  closed    as the Supreme Court hearing Wednesday demonstrated. The case won t close because of the failure of authorities to make full disclosure   and to conduct a full investigation into the case, including a complete autopsy.Vince Foster was not only deputy White House counsel but also the personal attorney to Bill and Hillary Clinton.On the night of Foster s death, top Clinton aides made a frantic effort to enter and remove documents from his West Wing office. In the days that followed, federal investigators were stymied in their investigation of Foster s office and strange death.Since Foster s July 1993 death, the facts of his death have been obfuscated by friends of Bill and Hillary in the major media, but here s the undeniable truth:There weren t  five  investigations into Foster s death, as the media report. The Park Police, best known for their meter and horse patrols around Washington, were put in charge of the initial death inquiry of the most important federal official to die suspiciously since President Kennedy. The Park Police, contradicting standard procedure, declared the death a suicide before launching their inquiry.Later, Robert Fiske, selected by Clinton s counsel Bernie Nussbaum and Janet Reno, quickly confirmed the Park Police probe as a suicide.But when Ken Starr entered the investigation, he reopened the case. His chief prosecutor in the case, Miquel Rodriguez, later quit the Starr investigation, claiming that Starr s staff was engaging in a cover-up of Foster s death.Rodriguez, a Harvard-educated federal prosecutor, argued that one of the Polaroid photos taken of Foster at the crime scene indicated an additional wound on Foster s neck   never noted on the autopsy report. Favish s suit before the Supreme Court is seeking to release this photo, among others.No fewer than three of the paramedics on the scene indicated in reports or testimony that the crime scene was consistent with a murder scene, not a suicide.A careful FBI microscopic investigation of Foster s shoes found not a trace of soil or grass stains on them, though he supposedly walked several hundred yards through wooded Fort Marcy Park to where his body was found. [Years later, Starr s investigation found plenty of soil and grass stains. Rodriguez charged that the shoes were tampered with to produce such  evidence. ]According to the FBI report on Vince Foster s death (below) blonde hairs were found on the body of Vince Foster, but were never investigated:Foster was found with little blood around his body   and despite claims that he fired the gun into his mouth, practically no blood was found on the front of his shirt.Foster was found with a 1913 revolver no one in his family could claim, with two serial numbers, made from the parts of three or more guns. None of Foster s fingerprints were found on the gun.For years, detail after detail emerged questioning the official ruling.Significant questions were raised about the unusual gun   a .38 Colt revolver made from the parts of three guns with two serial numbers   found conveniently in Vince s hand.The Park Police said one of the serial numbers indicated the gun was vintage 1913   and had no pedigree.Foster family members insisted neither Foster nor his father ever owned the old revolver.The NCIC keeps records of all law enforcment inquiries of serial numbers.On March 23, 2001, the FBI responded to requests made by a man names Craig Brinkley:Serial number 356555, one of the numbers on the gun, was never searched, not by the FBI, the Park Police or by that  investigation  by Ken Starr.Serial number 355055 was found on the frame of the gun. Brinkley believes that was the gun s real nnumber.That number was indeed searched by the Park Police, on the evening of Foster s death, more exactly at 22:45 EDT on July 20, 1993.Interestingly, searches were conducted on the same serial number no fewer than three times earlier that year, before Foster s death, on March 3, March 7 and April 29.Was someone checking to see that this gun had a  clean  predigree and was untraceable?The bullet from the gun that supposedly killed Foster was never found, despite intensive searches.Despite claims to the contrary, no one who knew Foster, including Hillary, Web Hubbell and his own wife, saw signs of depression.A so-called suicide note was found in an office briefcase that had been searched and found to be empty after Foster s death. The note was torn into 27 pieces. Yet an FBI examination found no trace of Foster s fingerprints on the note and a top Oxford handwriting expert found the note to be an  obvious  forgery.Despite the enormity of the case, Foster s autopsy lasted an astounding 45 minutes. The coroner in the case had previously been overruled in other cases he declared  suicides  that were later found to be murders.All of the X-rays taken during the autopsy are missing.Complete crime scene photos don t exist. The Park Police said all the photos were  accidentally  overexposed. A series of close-up Polaroids, which Favish is suing for, remain. This is just a brief summary of the dozens of inconsistencies in the case. Two New York homicide investigators who looked into the case concluded that Foster s body had been moved to the crime scene and that murder could not be ruled out.Despite overwhelming evidence of a cover-up, the media won t question the official ruling.Ken Starr, who could find no criminal wrongdoing on the part of the Clintons during his  intensive  probe, confirmed a ruling of suicide. Starr even hired O.J. Simpson s defense expert to prove his case.On August 23, 2016, The Daily Mail revealed that FBI agents  reported interviews documenting that Hillary Clinton s stinging humiliation of her friend and mentor Vince Foster in front of White House aides triggered the suicide of Vince Foster were missing from where they should be filed at the National Archives.On the first visit, archivist David Paynter provided the box of records that he said contained the FBI reports of interviews conducted by FBI agents on Foster s death. On a second visit, archivist James Mathis provided what he said were those same documents.While the box contained dozens of FBI reports concerning Foster s death   including interviews with the medical examiner, U.S. Park Police officers, and White House aides about the contents of Foster s office    the reports on Hillary Clinton s role in his death were absent.After filing a Freedom of Information request with the National Archives, Martha Murphy, the archives  public liaison, reported that she directed a senior archivist to conduct a more thorough review of the relevant FBI files, including those that had not been previously made public in response to FOIA requests. He examined all eight boxes but found no interviews by any investigator that detail either a meeting between Hillary Clinton and Vince Foster or the effects of a meeting between Hillary Clinton and Vince Foster on Vince Foster s state of mind,  Murphy reported in an email.After firing Republican FBI Director William S. Session, President Bill Clinton temporarily replaced him with Floyd I. Clarke and then on September 1, 1993 he Louis Freeh became the FBI Director. Right from the start, the Freeh FBI was drenched in controversy. The  screw-ups  were legion from the exposure of fraudulent FBI crime lab results to the wrongful blaming of an innocent man for the bombings at the Atlanta Olympics to the bloody standoff and shootout at Ruby Ridge.

 KKK Poster Boy David Duke Qualifies For Louisiana Senate Debate Being Held At Black University,"Former KKK grand wizard David Duke has officially qualified to participate in the Louisiana state senate debate after pulling in a whopping five percent of the vote in a new poll. The debate will be televised and is being held at a historically black university.Duke, who is a well-known white supremacist, announced in July that he was running for a seat on the Louisiana state senate. Not only has he been disavowed by his fellow Republicans, but the Republican National Committee and Louisiana GOP also looked into ways to boot his bigoted butt out of the party altogether.The debate itself is being hosted by Dillard University, a university in New Orleans that is historically black. Regarding this ironic twist of fate, Duke said Dillard is pretty supportive of Black Lives Matter, and I ve been pretty critical of them.  He added that he plans to request extra security at the event. Go figure.The poll that determined Duke had garnered the necessary five percent of the vote was commissioned by Raycom Media, which is the owner of four television stations throughout the state of Louisiana. The poll was conducted by Mason-Dixon between Oct. 17 to Oct. 19 and included 625 registered voters.As for the rest of the candidates in the race and their standings in the poll, Politico reports:  Louisiana hold its all-party primary on Election Day. A candidate can win the seat with a majority of the vote, but the Senate seat looks almost certain to go to a Dec. 10 runoff between the two top vote-getters that day. GOP State Treasurer John Kennedy led the poll with 24 percent of the vote, followed by Democratic Public Service Commissioner Foster Campbell with 19 percent and Democratic attorney Caroline Fayard with 12 percent. Republican congressmen Charles Boustany and John Fleming earned 12 and 11 percent of the vote, respectively. When Duke announced his bid for the senate seat late last summer, he said that his decision to run had been inspired by the success of Donald Trump. In the video he released, Duke said was  overjoyed to see Donald Trump and most Americans embrace most of the ideas that I ve championed for years.

BREAKING DISCOVERY: CLINTON FOUNDATION SHARED EMAIL SERVER LOCATION WITH HILLARY’S SECRET SERVER,"The news gets worse every day for the Clinton Crime Syndicate Breitbart News Exclusive: Hillary Clinton s private email server was housed at the same physical location and on the same network as an email server used and operated by the Clinton Foundation, Breitbart News has exclusively learned.Records reveal that Hillary Clinton s private clintonemail.com server shared an IP address with her husband Bill Clinton s email server, presidentclinton.com, and both servers were housed in New York City, not in the basement of the Clintons  Chappaqua, New York home.Web archives show that the Presidentclinton.com Web address was being operated by the Clinton Foundation as of 2009, when Hillary Clinton registered her own clintonemail.com server.Numerous Clinton Foundation employees used the presidentclinton.com server for their own email addresses, which means that they were using email accounts that, if hacked, would have given any hacker complete access to Hillary Clinton s State Department emails, as well.The bombshell revelation raises new concerns about the possible illegality of Hillary Clinton s private email use. The former Secretary of State is under federal investigation for potentially violating the Espionage Act by allowing people without a security clearance to access classified information. The fact that Hillary was sharing an email network with a private foundation means that people without a security clearance almost certainly had physical access to her server while she was working at the State Department.Here s what we know:The Servers Have The SAME IP AddressHillary s clintonemail.com server and the Foundation-run presidentclinton.com email server have exactly the same IP address, and the same SSL certificate (which an organization purchases for an email server to verify its trustworthiness).mail.clintonemail.com and mail.presidentclinton.com both have an IP address of 64.94.172.146, according to an SSL Certificate Checker.The two servers both have that same IP address, 64.94.172.146, according to DNS records. (Here are records for Hillary s server, and here are records for Bill s server).Both servers have the same IP address, according to another independent Internet records database, robtex.net.The fact that both of these email servers have the same IP address means that they were operating on the same network, and sharing physical space. A computer expert tells Breitbart News that the servers were probably operating on the same machine. It is also possible that they were operating on different machines on the same network, which still means that the machines would have to be close enough to exist in the same physical location.President Clinton s server was created in 2002, while Hillary s was created in 2009, which means that Hillary s server was simply added to Bill s Foundation-run server network.They Had The SAME IP Address When She Was Secretary of StateHillary s server and Bill s Foundation-run server also shared a different IP address during her tenure as Secretary of State.From September 8, 2009 until June 24, 2011, Bill Clinton s Foundation-run mail.presidentclinton.com server had an IP address of 24.187.234.187, according to DNS records.Hillary s mail.clintonemail.com server had the same exact IP address, 24.187.234.187, from the dates May 21, 2010 until October 21, 2010, according to DNS records.Their Shared IP Address Can Be Traced to Midtown ManhattanA geographical search for the IP address that both servers shared at registration traces to Midtown Manhattan, according to three different databases: infosniper.net, which locates a Midtown latitude/longitude point, ip-tracker.org, which also gives a Midtown latitude/longitude point, and whatsmyip.org.Clinton Foundation headquarters are currently located at 1271 6th Avenue in Midtown. Bill Clinton s office is at 55 West 125th StreetThe Denver-based firm Platte River Networks told Breitbart News that it physically moved Hillary Clinton s private email server out of the basement of her Chappaqua home in 2013. But the Clintons could have moved the server from Manhattan to Chappaqua before Platte River got there.Clinton Founation Employees Had presidentclinton.com email addressesThe employees who have used presidentclinton.com email addresses included former Bill Clinton right-hand man Doug Band, as well as Justin Cooper, a Hillary aide who has worked with the Foundation, Terry Krinvic, Laura Graham, and John Zimmerebner.Was Chelsea Clinton On The Server?The email server for mail.chelseaoffice.com, which is no longer active, resolves to clintonemail.com, according to DNS records. Wikileaks confirms that the chelseaoffice.com server was used by Chelsea Clinton employees.Hillary Even Admitted That She Used Her Husband s  System Well the system we used was set up for President Clintons office and it had numerous safeguards it was on property guarded by the Secret Service and there were no security breaches, so I think that the use of that server which started with my husband proved to be effective and secure,  Hillary Clinton said in a March 2015 press conference.Clinton has not returned to that talking point since.The Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton s campaign did not return requests for comment by press time.

John Mac Intyre (@JayMac8500) December 8, 2016Time explains that  for better or worse,  Trump was named  Person of the Year  because he had the  greatest influence  over the news this year:The revolution he stirred feels fully American, with its echoes of populists past, of Andrew Jackson and Huey Long and, at its most sinister, Joe McCarthy and Charles Coughlin. Trump s assault on truth and logic, far from hurting him, made him stronger. His appeal part hope, part snarl dissolved party lines and dispatched the two reigning dynasties of U.S. politics. Yet his victory mirrors the ascent of nationalists across the world, from Britain to the Philippines, and taps forces far more powerful than one man s message.We can scarcely grasp what our generation has wrought by putting a supercomputer into all of our hands, all of the time. If you are reading this, whether on a page or a screen, there is a very good chance that you are caught up in a revolution that may have started with enticing gadgets but has now reshaped everything about how we live, love, work, play, shop, share how our very hearts and minds encounter the world around us. Why would we have imagined that our national conversation would simply go on as before, same people, same promises, same patterns? Perhaps the President-elect will stop tweeting but only because he will have found some other means to tell the story he wants to tell directly to the audience that wants to hear it.Time is correct that Trump has perhaps had the greatest impact on the news, but one must wonder why they would choose to reward the bigotry and hate he encouraged and continues to encourage in their annual marketing gimmick. Normally, this would be a run-of-the-mill honor, even for a dictator (Time called Hitler the  greatest threatening force that the democratic, freedom-loving world faces today  in their 1938 article), but Trump thrives off of the attention and Time should have made the decision not to enable him.Featured image via Time",News,"December 8, 2016",4765
 That Time Donald Trump Posed As His Own Spokesman To Brag About Himself (VIDEO),"Donald Trump is pretty terrible. He s exactly the sort of person who would suggest that Muslims be banned from entering the United States. He s the type of guy who would force any Muslims in the United States to register in a national database and wear special badges, then throw them in concentration camps as a  temporary measure. Trump has spoken openly about building a wall between the United states and Mexico to keep brown people out, openly encouraged his supporters to beat African-Americans at his rallies. Hell, he even has been known to keep a book of Hitler s speeches by his bedside for light reading. He s repeatedly lied throughout his campaign in an effort to paint himself as the best option to serve as President of the United States. But the Washington Post has revealed yet another facet of Trump s douchebaggery: he s also the type of guy who would pretend to be his own public relations  person so he can talk himself up.The Washington Post has uncovered an old recording of what sounds like The Donald talking himself up while speaking to reporters. The recording is from 1991, and is between the now-GOP nominee   sorry,  John Miller    and a reporter from People Magazine. Sue Caswell was covering Trump s media circus-of-the-time   his divorce from Ivana Trump, who says her former husband brutally raped her in just one of the many incidents that led to the end of their marriage as well as his relationship with Marla Maples.The  spokesman  had some interesting insight into Trump s personal life, telling Caswell that he  really didn t want to make a commitment  to Maples because he s  coming out of a marriage, and he s starting to do tremendously well financially.  He assured Caswell that Trump is a  good guy  who isn t  going to hurt anybody  and  treated his wife well    you know, aside from the horrific abuse, and all: Have you met him?  He s a good guy and he s not going to hurt anybody.  The one article said he was going to throw her out of the apartment is total nonsense.  He is going to always treat her well as he treated his wife well.  I mean, he paid his wife a great deal of money.  He did it in a very bad period of time and, ultimately, that was settled.  There were those that say that that was even put that way.  I don t know if you heard that but that Trump became poor until he got his divorce.  And then all of a sudden, he s been doing very well and I guess you probably heard that, too.But he treated his wife well and he treated   and he will treat Marla well.  He s somebody that has a lot of options, and, frankly, he gets called by everybody. He gets called by everybody in the book, in terms of women. Trump explained that he is  sort of handling PR because [Trump] gets so much of it,  and that he was simply doing the PR gig  part-time,  and even took the time to regail Caswell with a tale of the time he met Madonna.Other reporters say they received similarly suspicious calls from  Miller  or  John Barron,  and those reporters all say Trump was the person behind the calls. In fact, some of his top aides and Trump himself have confirmed that he was doing his own PR work. In 1991, People reported:Just two weeks ago, though, Ms. Maples was not even taking The Donald s calls. Not after a PEOPLE reporter played her a tape on June 26 of a man saying that he was a Trump publicist named John Miller. A shocked, devastated Marla identified the voice as that of Trump himself. He announced, among other things, that he d traded in his Georgia peach for an Italian model (Carla Bruni).  When I heard his voice on that tape saying those things, I said,  Whoa! Uh-uh. No more,    says Marla.  If he could say all that stuff and act like it s cool to have this playboy image, then oh my gosh, all I could say was,  Baby, you re on your own.   So she packed a bag, ducking the press as well as The Donald s persistent appeals to reconcile, and took refuge at the Greenwich, Conn., home of her close friend, morning talk show host Kathie Lee Gilford. There she talked, prayed (she and Kathie Lee are both devout Christians) and came to a Donald-less conclusion:  I realized I was not going to die without this person in my life. Meanwhile a penitent Don Juan-ald had come to the opposite conclusion. The John Miller fiasco he called a joke gone awry.  What I did became a good time at Mar-la s expense, and I m very sorry,  says the newly humbled tycoon. As for his wandering eye,  I d felt that I needed space and freedom after the divorce, so I took the opportunity to go out with other women, but I kept coming back to Marla. I realized, why go looking for something when you already have exactly what you want? Despite all of this, on Friday Trump denied that he was the guy behind the calls. I don t know anything about it,  Trump said during an appearance on NBC s Today: I have many, many people that are trying to imitate my voice, and you can imagine that. This sounds like one of these scams, one of the many scams. It doesn t sound like me. It was not me on the phone,  he rambled.  And it doesn t sound like me on the phone, I will tell you that. It was not me on the phone. Hear that folks? It wasn t him on the phone. It wasn t him with a bone. It wasn t him on a train. It wasn t him on a plane. It wasn t him on a boat, in a moat, or you get the idea. Sure, he may have admitted it in the past, but he s running for President now. Why tell the truth? This was so farcical, that he pretended to be his own publicist. Here was this so-called billion-dollar real estate mogul, and he can t hire his own publicist,  Carswell said upon listening to the tape for the first time in more than two decades.  It also said something about the control he wanted to keep of the news cycle flowing with this story, and I can t believe he thought he d get away with it. Unfortunately, he keeps getting away with things. Despite his horrific remarks, his repeated lies, and his generally awful attitude, The Donald has managed to land himself the spot as the 2016 GOP nominee. Republicans have repeatedly given him a pass no matter what he says or does because he represents all that is terrible about our society   bigotry, hatred, racism, xenophobia   and that is exactly what appeals to them.Compared to Trump s numerous other lies this is a small one, but it does show how important it is to him that he controls the narrative.Listen to the call below:Featured image via Getty Images/Isaac Brekken",News,"May 13, 2016",6465
 WATCH: Trump Awkwardly Panders To Empty Black Church So White People Will Vote For Him,"Trump has recently caught on to the fact that there just aren t quite enough angry white guys and open racists to get him elected, and has decided to strike a more moderate tone   sometimes   in an effort to have broader appeal. If you believe the Trump camp, he s honestly trying to court the vote of black Americans. For those of us that weren t born yesterday, it s pretty obvious what the real goal is here: He s trying send a message to the  not racist  white voters at home that it really is morally acceptable to vote for him, promise!And it s pretty obvious black people aren t buying it, either. Trump has made headlines today for a highly publicized photo op at an African-American church ( This is the first African-American church he s been in y all,  Bishop Jackson said, as he introduced him) but apparently, a significant percentage of the congregation stiffed him. There were also protests outside, and inside, the building was nearly empty, as shown in this Tweet by Politico s Shane Goldmacher: Nowhere near a full crowd as Trump enters (far left) pic.twitter.com/kL1AlVukG4  Shane Goldmacher (@ShaneGoldmacher) September 3, 2016Even for this photo op, Trump was not fully able to turn the racism off, however. His speech, obviously written by someone else, was full of subdued tones and pandering, but this video clip by ABC News probably sums it up best:  .@realDonaldTrump:  A lot of people don t realize  Abraham Lincoln was a Republican https://t.co/q9Gu8G8cMw https://t.co/i4kQQ7cPF2  ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) September 3, 2016Because if you re black and from Detroit, what are the chances you know anything about American history, amiright?

Westbrook said Trump would struggle to cut into Clinton s overwhelming support among African-Americans.  Her track record is so long with black people,  he said, mentioning her work for children in the 1970s.  Donald Trump hasn t done anything for black people in 30 years. As I said, Trump s not fooling anybody. And to you conservative-leaning white people that aren t racist and have felt better about voting for Trump over the last week of his  outreach,  don t. He s still as racist and repugnant as always, and the fact that his  outreach  has consisted of assuaging the doubts of suburban whites makes his racism insidiously worse than ever.Featured image via screen capture",News,"September 3, 2016",3409
 WATCH: Trump Supporter Accuses Hillary Of Sexual Assault And CNN Panel Demolishes Them,"Donald Trump s new strategy to spin away from the sexual assault avalanche that is burying him apparently includes accusing Hillary Clinton of sexual assault.Because that s exactly what Trump minion Gina Loudon did during an appearance on CNN with Don Lemon on Monday night.Loudon and fellow Trump minion Betsey McCaughey tried to steer the discussion from Trump s sexual assault comments to claims of mass election fraud, which Trump has repeatedly tried to convince everyone is a thing that actually happens even though it is incredibly rare in our country.At that point, panelist Bakari Sellers had had enough and shut both women down to return the discussion to the topic at hand. This is absurd,  Sellers said.  Bless your heart, both of you, this is patently absurd. You talked about the fact that Donald Trump somehow had allegations that were unproven. No. Melania Trump was on camera today, trying to deal with his own comments coming out of his mouth. We weren t even at the allegations. We were at the point that he said he likes to sexually abuse people. You cannot be serious,  Loudon exclaimed. But Sellers refused to back down.  That s sexual assault, is it not?  he asked.Indeed, Trump bragged about groping women against their will back in 2005 while on a hot mic while on Access Hollywood. Groping women against their will is the exact definition of sexual assault. But Loudon has a totally different definition and she openly stated it on national television when she openly accused Hillary Clinton of sexually assaulting Bill Clinton s accusers. Words are not sexual assault,  she claimed.  What is sexual assault is what Hillary Clinton did to the women her husband absolutely, factually assaulted. Wow. Donald Trump s supporters literally just sunk to a new low in their desperate effort to paint Hillary as worse than the Republican nominee.Lemon and Sellers were stunned by the ridiculous accusation and former Philadelphia mayor Michael Nutter told the two women that they are embarrassing themselves.Loudon insisted that Hillary paid $100,000 to a private investigator to  dig up bad stuff on these women,  but when Lemon and Nutter told her there was no evidence of her claims, the best Loudon could offer is that there is an alleged tape and that she has heard it. In other words, hearsay, which is not evidence.Nutter went on to slam Donald Trump as a liar and he actually listed off many of the things Trump has lied about, and unlike Loudon s claim, there is evidence to back him up.Here s the video via VidMe.Donald Trump has no business being a candidate for the presidency and his supporters should not be allowed on national media programs. All they have done is lie throughout this campaign and accusing Hillary of sexual assault should be the last time Gina Loudon is ever invited back on CNN or any other news outlet.Featured image via screenshot",News,"October 18, 2016",2884
OBAMA’S FEDERAL AGENTS CAUGHT Spying On Law-Abiding Gun Show Customers,"Big brother is alive and well 3 months only 3 months In Obamaland surveillance on Muslim terror suspects is considered Islamaphobia, surveillance on Black Lives Matter riots is considered racism, but surveillance on law-abiding gun owners is an important crime-fighting tool. It turns out that federal agents have been spying on customers at guns shows and tracking their movements. Why? Because the current administration is hostile to legal gun ownership and completely inept.The Wall Street Journal originally broke this story but they have a stupid business model and put the article behind a pay wall. Thankfully there is this thing called the Internet where all information is available for free and Fox News has the scoop:The first problem you may notice in this illegal surveillance is how insanely pointless the operation is. There was no way this would ever yield any results if you understand California gun law. The Golden State does not have the  gun show loophole  that liberals love to blame for all crimes involving a gun. Even at a gun show, a person purchasing a firearm must undergo a background check and wait 10 before taking possession of the weapon.All gun transfers in California go through a federally licensed firearms dealer with no exceptions. Handgun purchases are limited to one every 30 days and require additional licensing. The state maintains a firearms registry. This is the last place in America where a person would try to make a straw purchase. Even less so for someone trying to buy guns, smuggle them into Mexico, and arm the drug cartels.On top of all that, California also bans many popular handguns and all  assault rifles.  Do the feds really think there is a vibrant black market in Mexico for California-compliant weapons? Apparently so.And despite the feds  claim, this was completely illegal it is most certainly not. The government can t just start spying on Americans without probable cause that a crime is being committed. The feds went fishing here and they forgot to bring bait, rods, and reels. They also didn t pick a spot with any fish.If the feds want to know how guns are getting from the US to Mexico they should go ask former Attorney General Eric Holder who green-lit Operation Fast and Furious. In that, the BATF let guns  go walking  from US gun stores right into the hands of the Mexican drug cartels. One of those guns was used to kill a US border patrol agent.

 Former KKK Leader Thanks Trump’s VP For Being So Nice (AUDIO),"The most infamous leader of the Ku Klux Klan has just proven that the biggest bullies have the thinnest skins. Former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke, a Trump-loving white supremacist who spent a good chunk of his life leading a hate group, apparently doesn t like to be called bad names because it hurts his feelings.Duke let Americans in on his sensitive side when the ex-KKK leader spoke about the fact that Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence had held off on calling Duke names like  deplorable  (even though Pence has disavowed Duke s support, unlike his boss). In return for his kindness and compassion, Duke praised Pence extensively on his radio show for refusing the call Duke exactly what he is. Duke said: The whole idea that they were trying to make Pence call me names basically, and he didn t bite on that, was a real positive thing for all of us. The secret alliance between Duke and the Trump campaign is disgusting, and it has had disastrous effects. Because he was so inspired by Trump s racist and hateful presidential campaign, Duke is now running for the Senate   and why wouldn t he, when several Americans have been so accepting of the racist and anti-Semitic views that Trump holds as well? The Trump campaign has basically paved the way for people like Duke!You can listen to Duke rave about Pence below:The terrifying thing about Trump s campaign is that the GOP nominee has literally made it ok for hate speech and bigotry to be expressed publicly. He has, in many ways, normalized it in his campaign speeches, his violence-provoking rallies, and by sharing white supremacist and anti-minority messages on social media on a regular basis. Trump has made room for the most awful, divisive views to be expressed and given people like Duke the guts to have platforms they never would dared to pursue before.

 Nancy Pelosi BRILLIANTLY Points Out the Brutal FAIL In Trump’s Address To Congress (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s join address to Congress last night left much to be desired, and many Democratic leaders are absolutely disgusted by what they heard and witnessed from the undeserving POTUS.In response to Trump s pathetic speech, Minority Leader of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi has received the following statement, which blatantly calls Trump out for being untrustworthy and fake. Pelosi wrote: The President s speech was utterly disconnected from the cruel reality of his conduct. And she s absolutely right. Trump s speech was completely disconnected from what he has done so far, and Pelosi accurately assessed Trump s address as a  bait-and-switch assault on America.  She also brilliantly pointed out that Trump has yet to actually back up any of his campaign promises and proposals.Pelosi also called Trump out for  selling working people down the river to Wall Street  and for jeopardizing  the security of our country  and weakening  our fight against terror with his Administration s dangerous, incompetent and unconstitutional actions.  Those are harsh words, but they re absolutely true and reflect how the majority of Americans feel about Trump s first few weeks in the White House. At the end of her statement, Pelosi warned Trump that  Democrats will continue to lead the fight  against his disgusting rhetoric and harmful policies.Echoing Pelosi s statement, colleague Chuck Schumer also held a similar opinion of Trump s address to Congress:Unlike Trump, who is infamous for walking back and flip-flopping on his stances to please the masses, Pelosi only doubled down on her comments earlier this morning in an appearance on MSNBC s  Morning Joe .

 WATCH: Trump’s Attorney Flat-Out ADMITS Trump Admin Just Too Intellectually Lazy To Study Facts,"Trump s Syrian policy is all over the place, to the point where The Economist actually published a story saying,  Wanted: a coherent Syria policy.  Trump s position was  let Syria handle its own problems,  right up until Assad dropped sarin gas on his people. It wasn t until the images of poisoned children started coming in that he decided we needed to respond. Why?Trump s attorney, Michael Cohen, appeared on CNN with Chris Cuomo to discuss President Flip-Flop s new Syria policy. Cuomo asked why Trump would shift from a hands-off-Syria policy to an intervene-now policy, and Cohen s response was downright frightening: When we were watching, whether it was here on CNN or any of the other stations, the Syrian refugees that were leaving, they weren t the young. They weren t the aged. They weren t women. They were all these 19 to 25-year-old men that when they were walking to these makeshift homes in Germany that they put up for them, it looked like a military operation. Cuomo responded by saying that those videos were selective, and the numbers and facts painted a very different picture of the refugees coming out of Syria.  Yes, you have young men, but those refugees are the same people that the president is saying he cares so much about. Cuomo is referring to the sheer hypocrisy of this administration s current Syria policy: Assad is gassed his own people, including women and children, but Trump doesn t want to accept the refugees Assad s regime creates. Unfortunately, that didn t sway Cohen, who doubled down on the idea that misleading videos are more reliable than data and facts:CUOMO: Yeah, the question is, why were people picking those videos? Was it misleading? The data would say yes.COHEN: But maybe it wasn t misleading. Maybe it was more of the reality, what was going on.CUOMO: No, but the numbers, Michael, say it s not the reality.COHEN: Again, I don t want to start talking about numbers. Numbers have not proven to suit me well.And there it is: Cohen and Trump and probably a large chunk of the entire administration is too intellectually lazy to try and understand facts and data.Watch the full exchange below:Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",News,"April 12, 2017",2203
LIST OF U.S. STATES With Most Illegal Aliens,"Wow these are some pretty eye-opening statistics Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has made illegal immigration a cornerstone of his campaign, proposing a simple solution for the nation s immigration woes: build a wall and make Mexico pay for it. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said, if elected president, he would seek out and deport anyone in the country illegally. In contrast, Democratic candidate and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton proposes  a path to full and equal citizenship.  The varied policy proposals by presidential candidates reflect the schism of opinion among Americans on immigration issues.In order to better comprehend this issue, InsideGov synthesized the most recent estimates and broke down the undocumented immigrant population groups by country of birth. This information comes from the Migration Policy Institute s  Unauthorized Immigrant Population Profiles,  which was published in 2013 and contains the most recent data estimates. We then ranked the 25 U.S. states with the largest populations of people living there illegally, and ordered the states from smallest to largest undocumented populations.See the 25 States with Most Undocumented ImmigrantsNote: Data is not provided by the source for Montana, North Dakota or Vermont.Oklahoma #25 Estimate of Undocumented Population: 80,000In 2007, Oklahoma passed a state bill, HB 1804, that made it illegal to house or transport immigrants lacking legal status, allowed law enforcement to verify the citizenship status of anyone arrested and made it more difficult for undocumented immigrants to receive government IDs or assistance.Minnesota #24 Estimate of Undocumented Population: 81,000Jose Antonio Vargas, an immigration activist who publicly revealed his illegal status in 2011, was arrested in 2012 in Minnesota for driving without a valid license. He was interviewed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement but neither detained nor deported.Ohio #23 Estimate of Undocumented Population: 83,000A sheriff in Ohio made national headlines when he sent a controversial open letter to Mexican President Enrique Pe a Nieto asking for $900,000. The sheriff calculated that was the total cost for jailing Mexican immigrants who were in the U.S. illegally and committed crimes in his community. He wrote:  I think it only fair that you provide me with some financial support for dealing with your criminals.  There was no response from Nieto.Indiana #22 Estimate of Undocumented Population: 93,000Michigan #21 Estimate of Undocumented Population: 97,000Although Republican Gov. Rick Snyder has been a vocal advocate for immigration reform, he was the first governor to pause the resettlement of Syrian refugees in light of the November Paris attacks.South Carolina #20 Estimate of Undocumented Population: 99,000South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, a former member of the Gang of Eight, has advocated for comprehensive immigration reform. This failed 2016 GOP presidential candidate declared that policies in Republican frontrunner Donald Trump s immigration plan are  not practical  and  self-deportation on steroids. Connecticut #19 Estimate of Undocumented Population: 108,000In 2015, Connecticut state lawmakers expanded in-state tuition and financial aid to undocumented immigrants. Republican Senate Minority Leader Len Fasano said of the reforms:  What are we going to do as a nation? What are we going to do as a state? Are we going to leave you behind. What this says is we re going to give you that chance. Why not let that happen. We ll be a more productive state for it. In light of where we are and how we got here, we are here. Oregon #18 Estimate of Undocumented Population: 115,000Cylvia Hayes, the fiancee of former Democrat Gov. John Kitzhaber, once married an Ethiopian migrant so he could receive a green card. She explained during a press conference:  I was struggling to put myself through college and was offered money in exchange for marrying a young person who had a chance to get a college degree himself if he were able to remain in the United States.  Kitzhaber was re-elected for a fourth term despite the controversy stemming from this revelation.Tennessee #17 Estimate of Undocumented Population: 119,000A woman living in Tennessee received $200,000 in damages due to her mistreatment at a detention center following an arrest for driving without a legal license. She went into labor during her detainment and said she was shackled throughout this experience.Pennsylvania #16 Estimate of Undocumented Population: 136,000In 2007, a federal judge ruled unconstitutional an ordinance in Hazleton, Pennsylvania, that prevented undocumented immigrants from securing housing because it denied them basic civil rights, legal citizens or not. The judge wrote:  Hazleton, in its zeal to control the presence of a group deemed undesirable, violated the rights of such people as well as others within the community. Nevada #15 Estimate of Undocumented Population: 138,000Although Nevada ranks at 15th for its overall population of people living in the state illegally, a 2012 study by the Pew Research Center found that this group comprises the highest proportion of the state s population compared to the rest of the U.S.Colorado #14 Estimate of Undocumented Population: 164,000Illegal Pete s, a Colorado-based Mexican restaurant, received criticism from local community members for its name. They said the use of  illegal  implies a negative context regarding citizenship and racial discrimination. The name has not been changed.Massachusetts #13 Estimate of Undocumented Population: 185,000In Revere, Massachusetts, a high school cheerleading captain faced criticism for a tweet that commented on immigration. Her tweet, supposedly inspired by 2016 presidential candidate Donald Trump, stated:  When only 10 percent of Revere votes for mayor cause the other 90 percent isn t legal.  School officials started a  cultural sensitivity program  as a result of this tweet.Washington #12 Estimate of Undocumented Population: 204,000After the Vietnam War, the governor of Washington welcomed about 30,000 Vietnamese refugees who were denied entry by then-California Gov. Jerry Brown. Chandler Felt, a King County demographer, said:  So that kind of established a beachhead of recognition that King County was a welcoming place for refugees and immigrants. It really started to increase the rate of immigration. Since then we ve been getting refugees and immigrants from all different parts of the world. Maryland #11 Estimate of Undocumented Population: 233,000A Maryland second-grader made national headlines in 2010 when she posed a question about immigration to first lady Michelle Obama. The young girl asked:  My mom   she says that Barack Obama is taking everybody away that doesn t have papers.   But my mom doesn t have any papers. Virginia #10 Estimate of Undocumented Population: 247,000A Virginia immigration law passed in 2007 by Prince William County required police to investigate the citizenship status of suspects under arrest. This ordinance is still in effect.Arizona #9 Estimate of Undocumented Population: 264,000The passing of Senate Bill 1070 reflected the severity of immigration issues in Arizona. This controversial law allows police to pull over motorists on the assumption they may be in the country illegally. Most of the law s provisions were overturned in the Supreme Court decision Arizona v. United States.North Carolina #8 Estimate of Undocumented Population: 342,000Georgia #7 Estimate of Undocumented Population: 393,000New Jersey #6 Estimate of Undocumented Population: 509,000New Jersey s Ellis Island, a historic gateway to the United States for immigrants, processed over 12 million arrivals during its 62 years of operation.Illinois #5 Estimate of Undocumented Population: 519,000Illinois passed legislation in 2014 that allows residents to receive kidney transplants, regardless of their legal status. The program could be financially beneficial by offsetting the cost of emergency dialysis services, which are part of a state-funded program.Florida #4 Estimate of Undocumented Population: 605,000Florida holds a significant population of Cuban immigrants. Many make the dangerous journey across the Florida Strait from Cuba on rafts in an attempt to secure citizenship. The United States has a special immigration policy for Cubans, informally referred to as the  wet-foot, dry-foot  policy, where those who successfully make the journey to U.S. soil can apply for legal status after one year.New York #3 Estimate of Undocumented Population: 867,000 Many immigrants without proper documentation in New York claim Asia as their area of birth. They represent 10 percent of the total undocumented population in the United States.Texas #2 Estimate of Undocumented Population: 1,464,000A case against Texas, stemming from the refusal to issue birth certificates for U.S.-born children, made its way to federal courts in 2015. Texas officials required specific forms of ID from the mother before issuing her child s certificate, which immigrants without documentation could not produce.California #1 Estimate of Undocumented Population: 3,034,000California has the largest population of immigrants without proper documentation. The state provides a variety of benefits and protections to these populations. The City of Huntington Park attracted controversy when it was revealed that two members of city commissions were undocumented immigrants from Mexico.Via: InsideGov.com",Government News,"Apr 1, 2016",9512
Baltimore Braces For Chaos: Mistrial Declared In Freddie Gray Case,"The jurors in the Freddie Gray case were deadlocked so the judge asked them to continue deliberating. In the end, they just couldn t come up with a verdict. It didn t take long for protests to break out in front of the courthouse get ready for chaos once again in Baltimore BALTIMORE (RNN)   The judge declared a mistrial in the case of an officer charged in connection with the death of Freddie Gray after the jury failed to reach a verdict following deliberations over the course of three days.Freddie Gray jurors deadlocked, judge says keep deliberating William Porter was the first of six Baltimore police officers on trial. He was charged with manslaughter, second-degree assault, reckless endangerment and misconduct in office. Gray was injured after being taken into police custody and later died.A day before the mistrial, the judge ordered the jury to continue deliberating after they reported they had not reached a verdict. The jury sent a note to the judge that they were deadlocked. Deliberations began on Monday.Demonstrations broke out downtown within minutes of the announcement of the verdict, and law enforcement officers tried to disperse crowds that were blocking traffic.Tessa Hill-Aston, president of the Baltimore chapter of the NAACP, expected citywide protests Wednesday night. As much respect as I have for police, in this case Freddie is dead, and it didn t have to be that way,  Hill-Aston said.  Officer Porter admitted Freddie asked for help, and he didn t give it to him. At the end of the day, whenever someone asks for medical help and didn t get it, maybe Freddie could still be alive. Gray suffered neck and spinal cord injuries while in the back of the van on April 12. That resulted in his death one week later after falling into a coma.The van made several stops with Gray inside. Porter admitted in testimony last week he did not immediately call for a medic when Gray initially asked for help during the fourth stop.Prosecutors argued Porter ignored Gray s pleas for medical help and that Porter, who was driving the police transport van, went against department policy by not securing Gray properly in the back of the vehicle.Baltimore City Attorney Marilyn Mosby   who said Gray died from being handcuffed, shackled and unrestrained   ruled the death a homicide and charged the officers on May 1.Prosecutors must now decide whether to try Porter again. Each officer charged was scheduled to have separate trials.Via: kmov",left-news,"Dec 16, 2015",2463

 Trump Shocked As New Poll Reveals The Future Of Trumpcare; It’s Worse Than You Thought (Details),"It seems only natural that Donald Trump, the lowest rated president in modern history, should have extremely unpopular policies to match how much Americans refuse to support him.Aside from his disgustingly racist travel ban, there s another policy that Americans overwhelmingly despise   the American Health Care Act, also known as Trumpcare. While it s been widely known that Americans prefer Obamacare (the Affordable Care Act) much more than Trump s shady, disastrous alternative, the real numbers prove to be worse than originally thought. It turns out, one poll states that over 75% of Americans don t want Trump s heath care plan to get anywhere near them and their loved ones.This recent poll cited that the American public s support for Trumpcare is only 23%, which basically means that Trump is screwed if he thinks he can get this health care bill to take the place of Obamacare. Almost half (48%) of Americans stated that they were against Trumpcare, with most (43%) responding that they were  strongly  opposed to it.So while Trump likes to brag about all this  winning  he s doing, we have yet to see it reflect in the American public s opinion of him and his policies. People are passionately resisting Trumpcare, and have even taken to GOP town halls to openly protest against and condemn GOP lawmakers who are trying to help Trump take out Obamacare.Trump may not want to admit it, but he s dying in the polls. It s also been reported that only 29% of Americans felt Trump was right to fire FBI Director James Comey, and 78% of the public wanted the Russia investigation to be handed off to an independent commission.The more Trump tries, the more he fails. As time goes on, we can only expect his approval rating to continue on its downward slope as he makes more horrible decisions for the country.Featured image is a screenshot",News,"May 15, 2017",1846
 Dallas Police Chief Tells Congress To Shove Their Thoughts And Prayers: ‘Do Your Jobs!’ (VIDEO),"It started out as an observation, then it turned into a joke, and but it s become downright insulting. Each time America suffers from another horrific mass shooting, Republicans in Congress send their  thoughts and prayers  and do absolutely nothing else. Rather than work towards solutions, conservative politicians have found that merely saying a prayer before bed somehow absolves them of their reprehensible inaction towards gun violence.And Dallas Police Chief David Brown, like so many of us, is absolutely fed up.At a press conference updating the country about the investigation into the ambush of police officers in Dallas following a peaceful anti-police brutality march, he didn t remain silent about the culpability of Congress. In short, Chief Brown has had a lot of long days trying to fulfill his obligation to the public and get answers, but he s noticed lawmakers can t say the same. It s been business as usual   and that means no business on finding solutions to mass shootings.Dallas Police Chief Brown to Congress:  Do your job  pic.twitter.com/rhhoWPKSVX  Colin Jones (@colinjones) July 11, 2016Brown is not alone. Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings (D) recently pointed out something that conservatives had hoped would go unnoticed: Open Carry, the movement that allows Texans the right to carry AR-15s nearly anywhere in public, didn t help during the police ambush, and actually made everything much, much worse. Rawlings said Dallas police Chief David Brown told him that people running through the shooting scene with rifles and body armor required officers to track them down and bring them to the police department.  Whether that was time that could have been spent trying to find and stop the shooter is something police will have to comment on. Major Max Geron of the Dallas PD didn t mind answering that question:  There was also the challenge of sorting out witnesses from potential suspects. Texas is an open carry state, and there were a number of armed demonstrators taking part. There was confusion on the radio about the description of the suspects and whether or not one or more was in custody. Dallas police have every right to feel frustrated and sickened by the response from both their state Republican Party and the ones in Washington, D.C. Law enforcement agencies have repeatedly warned pro-gun lawmakers that these fanatical pushes to put guns in every citizen s hands and in every corner of public life means putting both civilians and cops at risk. It makes policing harder. It makes mass murder easier. And it makes the lines between  good guy with a gun  and  bad guy with a gun  impossible to separate.To be clear, Democrats need to bear some responsibility for inaction as well. After massacres at Sandy Hook and Aurora, there was motivation from Americans to finally fix this problem   and Democrats let it slip through their fingers. Following Orlando, progressive lawmakers seemed to show signs that enough was enough, but they need to keep at it.The way forward is simple: Congress needs to put the lives of American citizens above the  rights  of an AR-15.

 Racist Jerk Takes His Hate To National Black History Museum In The Most VILE Way Possible,"The Smithsonian s Museum of African-American History opened to much fanfare, and also, much hatred from white people who think that such a thing is an affront to white history and therefore, reverse discrimination. Since Trump was elected, hate crimes and incidents have skyrocketed, and now, some racist asshat (or more than one) has decided to take their hatred straight to that museum.By hanging a noose.Yes, seriously. Someone hung a noose up in the Museum of African-American History. And not just once, but twice over the last four days. The noose isn t an innocent symbol. It s a stark and painful reminder of the days when lynching was common practice, particularly against black people.Which is precisely the reason these people hang nooses like that. According to a spokesman for the Southern Poverty Law Center, it s been a long time since we saw hatred like this: We haven t seen such mainstream support for hate in decades, not since the Civil Rights era 50 years ago. We re witnessing a moment when there are tremendous challenges to the country that we built on pluralism and democracy. The civil rights accorded every American are firmly under threat. But people of color, women, the LGBTQ community, and every other marginalized group out there is apparently a direct threat to the straight, white, Christian American, and Trump s election has empowered them to act like they re just taking their country back from the  scourge  of political correctness they so decried during the campaign.The Smithsonian issued their own statement about this, and they cut whoever it is that s responsible for the nooses: The Smithsonian family stands together in condemning this act of hatred and intolerance, especially repugnant in a museum that affirms and celebrates the American values of inclusion and diversity,  wrote the secretary of the Smithsonian Institution David Skorton in an Institution-wide email.  We will not be intimated. Cowardly acts like these will not, for one moment, prevent us from the vital work we do. People who do this are trying to drag our country back to a time when they were comfortable because they could step on everybody different from them. We can t let that continue to happen.Featured image by Astrid Riecken via Getty Images",News,"May 31, 2017",2270
The New American Century: An Era of Fraud,"Paul Craig RobertsIn the last years of the 20th century fraud entered US foreign policy in a new way.  On false pretenses Washington dismantled Yugoslavia and Serbia in order to advance an undeclared agenda. In the 21st century this fraud multiplied many times. Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, and Libya were destroyed, and Iran and Syria would also have been destroyed if the President of Russia had not prevented it.  Washington is also behind the current destruction of Yemen, and Washington has enabled and financed the Israeli destruction of Palestine.  Additionally, Washington operated militarily within Pakistan without declaring war, murdering many women, children, and village elders under the guise of  combating terrorism.  Washington s war crimes rival those of any country in history.I have documented these crimes in my columns and books (Clarity Press). Anyone who still believes in the purity of Washington s foreign policy is a lost soul  Russia and China now have a strategic alliance that is too strong for Washington. Russia and China will prevent Washington from further encroachments on their security and national interests. Those countries important to Russia and China will be protected by the alliance.  As the world wakes up and sees the evil that the West represents, more countries will seek the protection of Russia and China.America is also failing on the economic front.  My columns and my book, The Failure of Laissez Faire Capitalism, which has been published in English, Chinese, Korean, Czech, and German, have shown how Washington has stood aside, indeed cheering it on, while the short-term profit interests of management, shareholders, and Wall Street eviscerated the American economy, sending manufacturing jobs, business know-how, and technology, along with professional tradeable skill jobs, to China, India, and other countries, leaving America with such a hollowed out economy that the median family income has been falling for years. Today 50% of 25 year-old Americans are living with their parents or grandparents because they cannot find employment sufficient to sustain an independent existance.This brutal fact is covered up by the presstitute US media, a source of fantasy stories of America s economic recovery.The facts of our existence are so different from what is reported that I am astonished. As a former professor of economics, Wall Street Journal editor and Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy, I am astonished at the corruption that rules in the financial sector, the Treasury, the financial regulatory agencies, and the Federal Reserve.  In my day, there would have been indictments and prison sentences of bankers and high government officials.In America today there are no free financial markets.  All the markets are rigged by the Federal Reserve and the Treasury. The regulatory agencies, controlled by those the agencies are supposed to regulate, turn a blind eye, and even if they did not, they are helpless to enforce any law, because private interests are more powerful than the law.Even the government s statistical agencies have been corrupted. Inflation measures have been concocted in order to understate inflation. This lie not only saves Washington from paying Social Security cost-of-living adjustments and frees the money for more wars, but also by understating inflation, the government can create real GDP growth by counting inflation as real growth, just as the government creates 5% unemployment by not counting any discouraged workers who have looked for jobs until they can no longer afford the cost of looking and give up.  The official unemployment rate is 5%, but no one can find a job.  How can the unemployment rate be 5% when half of 25-year olds are living with relatives because they cannot afford an independent existence?  As John Williams (shadowfacts) reports, the unemployment rate that includes those Americans who have given up looking for a job because there are no jobs to be found is 23%.The Federal Reserve, a tool of a small handful of banks, has succeeded in creating the illusion of an economic recovery since June, 2009, by printing trillions of dollars that found their way not into the economy but into the prices of financial assets.  Artificially booming stock and bond markets are the presstitute financial media s  proof  of a booming economy.The handful of learned people that America has left, and it is only a small handful, understand that there has been no recovery from the previous recession and that a new downturn is upon us.  John Williams has pointed out that US industrial production, when properly adjusted for inflation, has never recovered its 2008 level, much less its 2000 peak, and has again turned down.The American consumer is exhausted, overwhelmed by debt and lack of income growth. The entire economic policy of America is focused on saving a handful of NY banks, not on saving the American economy.Economists and other Wall Street shills will dismiss the decline in industrial production as America is now a service economy. Economists pretend that these are high-tech services of the New Economy, but in fact waitresses, bartenders, part time retail clerks, and ambulatory health care services have replaced manufacturing and engineering jobs at a fraction of the pay, thus collapsing effective aggregate demand in the US. On occasions when neoliberal economists recognize problems, they blame them on China.It is unclear that the US economy can be revived. To revive the US economy would require the re-regulation of the financial system and the recall of the jobs and US GDP that offshoring gave to foreign countries. It would require, as Michael Hudson demonstrates in his new book, Killing the Host, a revolution in tax policy that would prevent the financial sector from extracting economic surplus and capitalizing it in debt obligations paying interest to the financial sector.The US government, controlled as it is by corrupt economic interests, would never permit policies that impinged on executive bonuses and Wall Street profits.  Today US capitalism makes its money by selling out the American economy and the people dependent upon it.In  freedom and democracy  America, the government and the economy serve interests totally removed from the interests of the American people. The sellout of the American people is protected by a huge canopy of propaganda provided by free market economists and financial presstitutes paid to lie for their living.When America fails, so will Washington s vassal states in Europe, Canada, Australia, and Japan.  Unless Washington destroys the world in nuclear war, the world will be remade, and the corrupt and dissolute West will be an insignificant part of the new world.Dr. Paul Craig Roberts was Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy and associate editor of the Wall Street Journal. He was columnist for Business Week, Scripps Howard News Service, and Creators Syndicate. He has had many university appointments. His internet columns have attracted a worldwide following.

 Newt Gingrich Admits Trump Is No Longer Draining The Swamp,"It s no secret that Trump s  drain the swamp  shtick was just that -B.S. Since being elected last month, Trump has ben naming the dirtiest, swampiest monsters to head his cabinet and Administration. Bankers, donors, politicians galore are lining up to turn the United States into a fascist regime for the rich and powerful.Yet, somehow, his voters don t believe it for a second. They re still convinced he s going to drain the swamp, and anyone who says otherwise is just trying to tear him down.Only New Gingrich, and his all-knowing wisdom, inadvertently has exposed Trump for the fraud he really is. Talking to NPR s  Morning Edition,  the former Speaker (who left in disgrace), told reporters that Donald Trump will no longer be using the  cute  slogan of  drain the swamp  because it s not going to happen:I m told he now just disclaims that. He now says it was cute, but he doesn t want to use it anymore   [He had] written what I thought was a very cute tweet about  the alligators are complaining,  but somebody wrote back and said they were tired of hearing this stuff.And just like that, another Trump promise   and one of his biggest   goes down in flames because the elite Republicans (which includes Gingrich) don t want to hear it anymore. So that makes Trump either a liar or a turtle-on-a-fencepost. Or both. Gingrich added that  he s in a different role now, and maybe he feels that as president, as the next president of the United States, that he should be marginally more dignified than talking about alligators in swamps. Not only is he being  more dignified  than th alligators, he s giving them government positions   like the Treasury Department, the SEC, and even the Transportation Department.And just like that, Trump drops another thing people trusted him with. Get ready for four years of betrayal, lies, and rolling over for th very establishment he vowed to fight.Featured image via John Moore/Getty Images",News,"December 21, 2016",1937

ERIC TRUMP Says Political Correctness Motivated His Dad To Run: Renaming Of “Christmas Tree”…Forcing Firemen To Remove American Flag From Trucks,"Millennial propaganda tool for the Democrat Party, Buzzfeed  news  publication attempted to do a hit piece on Eric Trump. They claim that when Eric was giving his list of reasons his father chose to run for office, which included the insanity of the political correctness we see today, that he incorrectly stated the White House Christmas tree is called a  Holiday Tree.  But did he really misspeak?Buzzfeed never addressed the core of Eric Trump s comments, which were really about the ruin of our nation over political correctness. Instead, Buzzfeed chose to dissect one small part of what Eric Trump said about the White House Christmas tree, which, as it turns out, was actually mostly accurate.The White House  Christmas tree  was renamed the  Holiday Tree  in the 1990 s, Republican House Speaker Denny Hastert changed the name back to  Christmas tree  in 2005. This is the garbage young Americans are reading every day in their social media newsfeed. It s one of the primary reasons we see so many young people walking around in a stupor with Bernie Sanders or Hillary bumper stickers on their Prius .From Buzzfeed   Eric Trump, listing off reasons his father is running for president, said in an interview this week that one of the motivations was the renaming of the White House Christmas tree to  holiday tree. The tree placed on the White House lawn during the holiday season is still called the  National Christmas Tree. He opens up the paper each morning and sees our nation s leaders giving a hundred billion dollars to Iran, or he opens the paper and some new school district has just eliminated the ability for its students to say the pledge of allegiance, or some fire department in some town is ordered by the mayor to no longer fly the American flag on the back of a fire truck,  Trump told James Robison in an interview posted this week.Buzzfeed never questioned the validity of the ransom money our President covertly paid to Iran. They never questioned whether or not schools and local governments are attempting to eliminate the pledge of allegiance, so as not to offend immigrants or refugees. It s funny how they never suggested the story about the firemen being forced to remove the American flag from the back of their trucks was not 100% accurate. Nope just the accuracy of the Christmas tree comment Or he sees the tree on the White House lawn has been renamed  Holiday tree  instead of  Christmas tree,  continued Trump.  I could go on and on for hours. Those are the very things that made my father run, and those are the very things he cares about.

WATCH: FORMER PUERTO RICO Governor HUMILIATES Pouting MSNBC Host Mika Brzezinski For Putting Her Hate For Trump Before Needs Of Hurricane Victims,"A former governor of Puerto Rico shut down a question from MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski on Wednesday when she asked about President Donald Trump s treatment of San Juan Mayor Carmen Yul n Cruz.Trump and Cruz s interactions and criticisms have drawn national attention during the process of helping Puerto Rico recover from Hurricane Maria, with Cruz charging that the Trump administration has been too slow in delivering federal assistance. Trump tweeted criticism of her over the weekend, saying she exhibited  poor leadership  and that others in Puerto Rico were not doing enough to  get their workers to help. Upon meeting each other face-to-face on Tuesday, Cruz told Trump it was saving lives and  not about politics.  Trump shook her hand and then walked away.After  Morning Joe  played the clip, a cross-armed Brzezinski looked disgusted. After welcoming former Puerto Rico Gov. Luis Fortu o to the show, she asked him what he made of Trump s treatment of Cruz. I m very sorry, Mika, but I m not going to get into local politics,  Fortu o said.Brzezinski did a double take upon hearing his answer. If she s running for governor, there are different parties I don t care,  Fortu o said.  I care about results. Is that what you think it is?  Brzezinski asked.  You think it was politics that had him attacking her? I have no idea,  he said.  All I can tell you is we need results. We have people that desperately need help. As long as we get that help, we should not be talking about politics at this moment. WFB",politics,"Oct 4, 2017",1515
ANTHONY WEINER CAUGHT AGAIN: Sends Kinky Shot To Brunette With 4-Year Old Son Next To Him,"UPDATE: ANTHONY WEINER JUST DELETED HIS TWITTER ACCOUNT AFTER THE PHOTOS AND TWEETS WERE PUBLISHED. Is this guy Bill Clinton s twin separated at birth or what? Both of these men are just total pervs! Weiner resigned from Congress over his last escapade with sexting women.

LIST OF 22 TIMES OBAMA Called Phony Climate Change More Serious Than Terrorism,"Oh the irony of a terror attack by Muslims taking place on American soil on the heels of Obama s return from phony Climate Change Summit in Paris ISIS has taken responsibility for the horrifying attacks in Paris that have left more than 150 dead and hundreds wounded. French President Francois Hollande is calling for the closure of his country s borders. President Barack Obama didn t condemn Islamic radicals for the attacks, but he did call them  an outrageous attempt to terrorize innocent civilians  and  an attack on all of humanity and the universal values we share. Friday s deadly attacks thwarted Al Gore s long-planned Paris webcast and star-studded concert to promote climate change awareness. Out of solidarity with the French people and the City of Paris, we have decided to suspend our broadcast of 24 Hours of Reality and Live Earth,  the group said in an online statement.Coincidentally, in July 2008, Al Gore called climate change a more dangerous threat than terrorism.  I think that the climate crisis is, by far, the most serious threat we have ever faced,  Gore told ABC News.Below are 22 times Obama or his administration officials claimed climate change a greater threat than radical Islamic terrorism.In a January 15, 2008 presidential campaign speech on Iraq and Afghanistan, Barack Obama said the  immediate danger  of oil-backed terrorism  is eclipsed only by the long-term threat from climate change, which will lead to devastating weather patterns, terrible storms, drought, and famine. That means people competing for food and water in the next fifty years in the very places that have known horrific violence in the last fifty: Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. Most disastrously, that could mean destructive storms on our shores, and the disappearance of our coastline. On January 26, 2009, Obama delivered remarks at the White House on the  dangers  of climate change:These urgent dangers to our national and economic security are compounded by the long-term threat of climate change, which, if left unchecked, could result in violent conflict, terrible storms, shrinking coastlines, and irreversible catastrophe.In May 2010, the Obama White House released it s national security strategy, which said,  At home and abroad, we are taking concerted action to confront the dangers posed by climate change and to strengthen our energy security.  The document declared climate change  an urgent and growing threat to our national security. On September 6, 2012, during his Democratic National Convention speech, Obama said,  Yes, my plan will continue to reduce the carbon pollution that is heating our planet, because climate change is not a hoax. More droughts and floods and wildfires are not a joke. They are a threat to our children s future.On January 23, 2013, in an address before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Secretary of State John Kerry declared climate change among the top threats facing the United States.February 16, 2014, Secretary of State John Kerry addressed students in Indonesia and said that global warming is now  perhaps the world s most fearsome weapon of mass destruction. In a June 2014 interview, Obama said:When you start seeing how these shifts can displace people entire countries can be finding themselves unable to feed themselves and the potential incidence of conflict that arises out of that that gets your attention. There s a reason why the quadrennial defense review which the secretary of defense and the Joints Chiefs of Staff work on identified climate change as one of our most significant national security problems. It s not just the actual disasters that might arise, it is the accumulating stresses that are placed on a lot of different countries and the possibility of war, conflict, refugees, displacement that arise from a changing climate.During a September 2014 meeting with foreign ministers, Secretary of State John Kerry called Climate change a threat as urgent as ISIS.On September 24 2014, the Obama USDA launched its Global Alliance for Climate Smart Agriculture. In a memo posted by Secretary of State John Kerry, among other Obama administration officials, read, From India to the United States, climate change poses drastic risks to every facet of our lives. On October 29, 2014, in an address to the Washington Ideas Forum, Obama s Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said:From my perspective, within the portfolio that I have responsibility for security of this country climate change presents security issues for us. There s a security dynamic to that. As the oceans increase, it will affect our bases. It will affect islands. It will affect security across the world. Just from my narrow perspective, what I have responsibility for, that s happening now.During his 2015 State of the Union address, Obama said,  No challenge  poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change. In a February 2015 address to college students in Iowa, Vice President Joe Biden said  Global warming is the greatest threat to your generation of anything at all, across the board. On February 09, 2015, in an interview with Vox, Obama said he  absolutely  believes that the media  sometimes overstates the level of alarm people should have about terrorism  as opposed to  climate change. On February 10, 2015, when asked to confirm if this means Obama believes  the threat of climate change is greater than the threat of terrorism,  Earnest responded,  The point the president is making is that there are many more people on an annual basis who have to confront the impact, the direct impact on their lives, of climate change, or on the spread of a disease, than on terrorism. During his April 18, 2015 weekly address on climate change, Obama said,  Wednesday is Earth Day, a day to appreciate and protect this precious planet we call home. And today, there s no greater threat to our planet than climate change. In May 2015, the White House released a 1,300-page National Climate Assessment that declared climate change among the world s foremost threats.May 20, 2015 President Obama said in his keynote address to the U.S. Coast Guard Academy graduates:  Climate change, and especially rising seas, is a threat to our homeland security, our economic infrastructure, the safety and health of the American people. On July 13 2015, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency administrator Gina McCarthy and Obama s U.S. Ambassador to the Vatican Kenneth F. Hackett wrote in a joint blog post on the EPA website, praising Pope Francis for dedicating his second encyclical to urging swift action on global warming.McCarthy and Hackett wrote:As public servants working in both domestic policy and diplomacy, we understand the urgent need for global action. Climate impacts like extreme droughts, floods, fires, heat waves, and storms threaten people in every country and those who have the least suffer the most. No matter your beliefs or political views, we are all compelled to act on climate change to protect our health, our planet, and our fellow human beings.An Obama Defense Department report released on July 29, 2015 says climate change puts U.S. security at risk and threatens the global order:The report reinforces the fact that global climate change will have wide-ranging implications for U.S. national security interests over the foreseeable future because it will aggravate existing problems such as poverty, social tensions, environmental degradation, ineffectual leadership, and weak political institutions that threaten domestic stability in a number of countries.The report finds that climate change is a security risk because it degrades living conditions, human security, and the ability of governments to meet the basic needs of their populations. Communities and states that are already fragile and have limited resources are significantly more vulnerable to disruption and far less likely to respond effectively and be resilient to new challenges.In his August 28, 2015 weekly address, Obama said  This is all real. This is happening to our fellow Americans right now,  he said.  Think about that. If another country threatened to wipe out an American town, we d do everything in our power to protect ourselves. Climate change poses the same threat, right now. In a September address at the United Nations Climate Summit Obama said,  For all the immediate challenges that we gather to address this week terrorism, instability, inequality, disease   there s one issue that will define the contours of this century more dramatically than any other, and that is the urgent and growing threat of a changing climate. During a September 28 address at the United Nations, President Obama said that  We can roll back the pollution that we put in our skies,  adding that  No country can escape the ravages of climate change.

" Trump Whines About Fake News, CNN’s Chris Cuomo Just Shut Him Down PERFECTLY (VIDEO)","By now, we re all sick and tired of hearing Donald Trump whine about fake news, especially when he s team is a major creator of it.Earlier today, Trump went on one of his routine Twitter rants about fake news and unfavorable coverage, targeting  unwatchable  MSNBC and CNN for their  conspiracy theories  and  blind hatred.  To top it off, Trump happily endorsed Fox News, which has been proven to be the most dishonest media outlet there is.While Trump was whining about networks that tell the truth about how awful he is, CNN s Chris Cuomo hit back and completely shut him down. Cuomo pointed out that for someone who hates CNN, Trump is one of their most loyal viewers. Cuomo said: The president, as we know, watches  New Day.  We appreciate that viewership. He does not want to talk to us, but he does want to talk about us, and yet, this situation is different. He has said nothing to rebut the facts of this situation. On top of that, Cuomo and his colleagues spent the entire morning reporting on the details that Trump s senior advisors had been in  constant communication  with Russian intelligence during Trump s presidential campaign   making Trump look like a complete idiot.Cuomo also pointed out that fact that Trump hasn t been able to give an answer regarding Russia s involvement in the election or General Michael Flynn s communications with Russia that have now caused him to resign just 24 days after beginning his role as national security advisor. Cuomo said: Who knew? The idea that Flynn had to resign because he was soloing with this unique agenda with Russia that nobody else knew about, nobody had told him to do and nobody participated in is hard to believe and goes without good answer from the White House. Cuomo s attack on Trump is perfect, and hopefully it ll shut him up for a while so he can actually do his job:Featured image via screenshot and Alex Wong / Getty Images",News,"February 15, 2017",1905
 Chelsea Handler Gets The Last Word After RNC Chair Attacks Hillary For Not Smiling (VIDEO),"There may be a few women out there who enjoy a man telling them to be more joyous in their presence, but as for the rest of us, there s nothing a woman hates more than being told to smile.Do men smile all the time? No. Because if they did, we d think they were crazy and up to something. Same goes for women.Not every situation calls for a smile at all times. Especially when discussing foreign policy and our military. So, when RNC Chair Reince Priebus thought it appropriate to criticize Hillary Clinton for not smiling enough during the NBC forum hosted by Matt Lauer, it didn t exactly go over well.One person who definitely had a lot to say about Priebus and his request of a smile from Hillary was none other than Chelsea Handler on her hit Netflix show Chelsea.Chelsea began by asking Priebus: Who the f*ck are you to tell someone to smile? Adding: This is just another example of how men feel the can belittle every woman in the world and order up a smile. Chelsea then said: Stop telling women to smile. We don t like that. It s not an icebreaker, it s a deal breaker. Going for Priebus  jugular, Chelsea absolutely destroys him and his ridiculously corny smile, then says: You know when women will smile? When Hillary kicks that pneumonia and trounces Trump in November. And that s exactly right.Watch the full video here:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"September 19, 2016",1371
WATCH: LOUIE GOHMERT Wants LYING Democrat VA Governor McAuliffe Investigated For “Facilitating Violence” In Charlottesville,"Why did the Democrat VA Governor throw gasoline on the fire after violent protests broke out in Charlottesville? Why did the radical Democrat governor of Virginia LIE about weapons being stashed around the city of Charlottesville prior to the march? Was he just doing his part as a prominent member of the Democrat Party to help create more racial division in America? Why did he lie about Virginia police officers being underprepared for the violence and chaos that took place, when police officers claim they were completely prepared? Was he trying to shine a negative light on the police force assigned to Charlottesville, as part of the Democrat Party s ongoing plan to undermine the credibility of our law enforcement?Last week, Virginia police officers were speaking out, and setting  the record straight. They were not about to remain silent while their governor made up stories to boost his party s race dividing, cop-hating narrative.Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas is not just sitting around and wondering how the Clinton bestie was able to get away with lying about what happened in Charlottesville, while the media ignored Governor McAuliffe s part in inciting violence.Sunday on Fox News Channel s  Fox & Friends Weekend,  Gohmert called for a Department of Justice investigation of Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D-VA) and Charlottesville, VA Mayor Michael Signer for possibly facilitating the violence that took place in Charlottesville earlier this month.Gohmert said,  The way forward s not gonna be easy. And I think the Justice Department needs a full investigation of the governor, of the mayor. They said in court there would be violence at Charlottesville, and then the witnesses and the photographs show they herded these groups to create violence so they could brag. We need a Justice Department investigation into Kessler. You don t just go all of a sudden from having multiracial roommates and a Jewish girlfriend to all of a sudden being a white supremacist that wants to join the Republican party. There s something very, very wrong in all of this. He added,  Like they were the violence at Trump events, they may have been behind this violence getting started. They facilitated it, anyway.  -Breitbart ",left-news,"Aug 22, 2017",2229
 Why The Secret Service Is Investigating Glenn Beck (VIDEO),"The United States Secret Service is investigating conspiracy theorist and right wing radio host Glenn Beck. The probe is in relation to a statement Beck made on his nationally syndicated radio show while broadcasting from the CPAC conference.The agency is required to investigate any and all threats related to the people it is protecting, in this case it happens to be comments Beck made about Donald Trump, who Beck is opposed to. From CBS Dallas:During his radio show Friday morning, Beck and his producers were talking about the other candidates saying they would support Donald Trump if he becomes the Republican nominee.His producer mocked Beck after Beck mentioned being in the shoes of Trump s rivals: Was it gigantic shoes?  asked the producer Stu Burguiere. If I was close enough and I had a knife. Really. I mean the stabbing just wouldn t stop,  Beck responded, appearing to direct his comments at Burguiere.Beck s comments were blasted out by the conservative Daily Caller, which is run by Fox News host Tucker Carlson.But unlike so many other inflammatory statements from Beck, this may actually be a mistake. Beck was apparently talking about his producer, Stu Burguiere. Burguiere posted on his Facebook page after the incident noting,  If you were listening, you know that Glenn actually threatened me, not Donald Trump, so I am in the odd situation of defending my boss for threatening my life. The comments may have been seen as more credible because Beck has been a critic of Trump, claiming that his preferred candidate, Ted Cruz, is more qualified and destined for the presidency than Trump. Beck has accused Trump of being a huckster and a phony.It seems fitting that a conservative media outlet s sloppy reporting led to federal law enforcement being called in on another conservative media icon.Beck has for years promoted conspiracy theories about President Obama, Democrats, and other progressives. He also claimed that Obama hates white people and that he has been using the power of the government to give black people reparations. Beck s theories were so out there that advertisers began abandoning his afternoon show on Fox News, and the network soon dropped him. Now he broadcasts online and on a few niche cable networks, while still retaining his radio show   but even that is dwarfed by more successful hosts like Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity.Featured image via Flickr",News,"March 5, 2016",2405

 Joy Behar Gives GOP A PAINFUL Reality Check On Why She Will NEVER Accept Trump (VIDEO),"Now that former reality television star, serial rapist and all-around scammy businessman Donald Trump has won the election, many of his supporters are arguing that it s time the rest of America moved on and accepted him. However, most of us can t get behind the fact that a racist misogynist is going to be leading the country, and are still speaking out against the president-elect any chance we can get.One of those people is The View s Joy Behar, who gave conservatives the perfect reality check on why she will never stand behind Trump or his hateful rhetoric. On Friday, Behar railed against Trump and the idea that America must now come together under him and forget every awful thing he s said about women and minority groups during his presidential campaign.This discussion came up as The View s hosts were discussing whether or not left-leaning celebrities should perform at Trump s inauguration. When co-host Jedediah Bila argued that even celebrities who don t agree with Trump s message should perform for him, Behar strongly disagreed. Behar brought up the fact that Trump said several divisive, offensive things during his campaign that had a major impact. She said: I do not forget what he said when he was campaigning! He insulted every group! Bila tried to defend Trump, noting that Obama had a hard time winning everyone s acceptance in 2008, but Behar said there was no comparison between a moron like Trump and our great 44th President. Reminding Republicans that they fought Obama every step of his presidency, Behar said: They obstructed him for 8 years, so why do I have to be so nice? The resistance that the GOP is facing in regards to Trump is not only a taste of their own medicine, but it is humanity s reaction to a completely unqualified bigot that has just been given more power than he deserves or knows what to do with.You can watch Behar tear into the GOP below:Featured image via screenshot and Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"December 9, 2016",1955

Keep them engaged so you don t lose the Black voting block, but don t let them get too close Most notable is advising Democrats not to say  All lives matter  or to talk about  black-on-black crime  as this is the  worst thing  to say to Black Lives Matter activists.It describes BLM as  radical , which is pretty accurate and notes that it extends beyond questions of police brutality to  criminal justice reform . What they leave out is they don t want reform, they want eliminate prisons and police.Notice also it advises:  Don t offer support for concrete policy positions .

 The Hidden Root Of White Rage,"Paul Krugman asks a simple question about why white (conservative) people who fly into a rage always seem to do so over really stupid things:Something that strikes me, however   and which I don t fully understand   is that when people like this turn to angry rhetoric, with at least a hint of violence, the trigger events tend to be trivial. There are plenty of real grievances that could be motivating working-class whites Now, I loves me some Krugman but he s missing the super obvious here: White conservatives are angry at a racially unjust economic system that has started to treat white people the same it s always treated black people. It was supposed to benefit them to the detriment of  those  people and it did, decade after decade. White people enjoyed a lifestyle unprecedented in history and managed to deny that life to millions of minorities. But the rich got so greedy that the system is breaking down and now everyone is suffering. Except for the rich, of course.The end result is that they can t attack the system they love without admitting how unjust it was in the first place. What are they going to say?  Hey! Where are all the white jobs?! On top of this frustration is the cold and horrible (for white people) realization that they no longer have total control over the government. With a black president in the White House, there is zero chance of getting through the kind of policies that used to transfer immense amounts of wealth to the white community while leaving the black community out in the cold. Those days are over and with the rapid  browning  of America, they aren t coming back.This leaves us with millions of angry white people betrayed by a system they believed in and supported their entire lives. But to admit that the system was unjust would be to admit that they, white people, benefited at the expense of black people in the first place. Most white people, including liberals, would rather gnaw their arm off to escape this trap. And so they find the most ridiculous and mundane targets for their rage, a rage that should be directed at the system but can t be. It really is that simple.Featured image via AI archives",News,"January 6, 2016",2164
BRAVE SWEDISH JOURNALISTS CONFIRM That Trump Is Dead On About Sweden [Video],"SUBTITLED VIDEO:HERE S ANOTHER JOURNALIST S TAKE ON WHAT S HAPPENED TO SWEDEN: SWEDEN: FROM ABBA TO ALLAH In the 1970s Sweden was a stable and wealthy country that was admired by many outsiders. It had international pop artists such as ABBA, sports stars like Bj rn Borg and Ingemar Stenmark as well as Volvo cars. Some outsiders still maintain this rosy image. In 2016, Sweden was still ranked as the world s   goodest   country.Unfortunately, being  good  in the Western world today seems to mean being suicidal.In just two generations, Sweden has become an increasingly dysfunctional and crime-ridden country. The main cause of this negative transformation is non-European mass immigration.I have been chronicling Sweden s decline for many years. My reports were falsely dismissed as fantasies made by an alleged  right-wing extremist.  This denial is no longer possible.Many alternative media and independent websites are now describing these issues. Major media in Britain, Germany, the USA and even in Russia have also finally discovered Sweden s Multicultural problems. This is causing huge embarrassment to the ruling elites in Sweden. They are used to being admired. They are not accustomed to international ridicule, or being viewed as an example of what not to do.Events reached a peak when U.S. President Donald Trump publicly made negative remarks about the problems in Sweden. The Social Democratic Prime Minister Stefan L fven has repeatedly rejected suggestions that the authorities have lost control. On February 20, 2017, the former Prime Minister Carl Bildt accused President Trump of   engaging in misinformation and slander  against Sweden. That very same night, violent riots once again erupted in one of the no-go zones near Stockholm that allegedly do not exist.Car burning in Sweden, January 2017 All former Swedish governments since the 1970s, including those led by Mr. Bildt and Mr. L fven, have directly contributed to the massive problems Sweden is currently facing.Carl Bildt served as Prime Minister of Sweden from 1991 to 1994. He was in charge of a center-right coalition government by Swedish standards. Bildt served as Minister for Foreign Affairs between 2006 and 2014 in the center-right coalition of PM Fredrik Reinfeldt. These governments also continued mass immigration, just as the Socialist Prime Ministers Olof Palme, Ingvar Carlsson, G ran Persson and Stefan L fven did.The Swedish author Astrid Lindgren published the first stories about Pippi Longstocking in the 1940s. If they were updated for today, perhaps Pippi would have to flee from the suburbs of a Swedish city after having been gang raped by immigrant boys. Alternatively, she might have been a radical Feminist who donned the Islamic veil in order to express her solidarity with the Muslims who are colonizing her country.The Swedish mass media and political elites are very careful not to suggest any connection between rapes and mass immigration from Third World countries. Yet there is every reason to suspect that such a connection exists. We know from other Western European countries that immigrants from certain regions and cultures, particularly from the Islamic world and Africa, are disproportionately represented as perpetrators in rape cases.READ MORE: GATE OF VIENNA",politics,"Feb 22, 2017",3287
" Iran Stuns World In First Election Since Nuclear Agreement, Pro-West Reformists Sweep Seats","Republicans may have done everything they could to destroy the Iran nuclear deal, including dabbling in light treason, but President Obama was just vindicated for sticking to his guns   and in a HUGE way.In the first election held in Iran in the aftermath of the landmark nuclear deal, the Iranian people flooded to the polls in record numbers to support the warming relations between the two countries. For anti-American hardliners in Tehran, this was a very bad day. According to the Washington Post:Iranian reformists appear have won all 30 seats representing the nation s capital in parliament, a definitive rebuke to the hard-liners opposing President Hassan Rouhani s efforts to increase economic openness and cooperate with the West.In the first elections held since last year s nuclear deal, none of Iran s three main political camps   reformists, conservatives and hard-liners   is expected to win an outright majority, but early results indicate the best reformist showing in the 290-seat parliament in more than a decade.It was also a bad day for anti-Iranian hardliners in America. For months, Republican lawmakers have been attempting to destroy the merits of this international agreement under the premise that Iran will not abide by its agreed upon terms and that the country will never reform. Both theories have now been refuted. The United Nations recently announced that Iran had successfully fulfilled its obligations towards dismantling its nuclear program. Now even the government seems to be changing in a direction towards diplomacy and building international relationships.Iran seems on the verge of a monumental change, perhaps for the first time in decades. Years of threats from America moved the country very little, but the cooling tensions has allowed Iranian moderates to push for greater economic and social reforms. As a sign of the changing times, it is reported that more women than ever before ran and were elected to office.Reporters are predicting as many as 20 women could win seats in #IranElections2016. Historic, record-breaking figure https://t.co/woiSkLluzu  Golnar Motevalli (@golnarM) February 28, 2016That does not mean to say that everything is perfect. The country still hosts a number of appalling human rights violations against its own people. It also doesn t quite love America. At this point, the two countries merely talking to each other is a pretty huge deal.But no one outside of the Republican Party ever thought demanding immediate and unconditional surrender would ever work. Instead, Obama s strategy has always been to  trust, but verify  that the agreements he and Secretary of State John Kerry were hammering out were being fulfilled. The stakes are high: Greater prosperity for the Iranian public and a lesser chance of all out war between the United States and one of the biggest countries in the Middle East.None of this is likely to silence Obama s worst critics. They are beyond the point of rational thought about Iran. The results of this cognitive dissonance can occasionally be quite humorous. Just a day before Iranians went to the polls, and at the risk of looking like a complete jackass, conservative writer Eli Lake penned an anti-nuclear agreement rant for Bloomberg that predicted moderates would get demolished. Alas, it didn t pan out that way. It was an unmitigated  Karl Rove moment  and one that should serve as a reminder for other would-be critics to at least wait for the polls to come back before thinking up new ways to attack the President s deal with Iran.Something tells me they won t listen.Featured image via Twitter ",News,"February 28, 2016",3614

However, there s just one VERY BIG problem there: Pence flat-out lied throughout the debate. Well, this is likely something that people are just casual, general election political observers don t know. But, certainly pundits and political nerds knew this right away, and the non-partisan fact-checking operation Politifact was ready to call Pence out on his many, many lies. Here are just a few highlights:Pence:  Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate a status of forces agreement. We rated this claim Mostly False. In 2011, the Obama administration was negotiating with the Iraqi government to give American troops immunity prosecution by Iraqis   a touchy political issue.There s debate on whether the Americans could have worked out a deal, but Pence is wrong to suggest Clinton is to blame. The key decisions and discussions took place between the White House itself and Iraqi leaders.Pence:  They want to expand (Obamacare) into a single-payer program. Clinton and Kaine have proposed a public option   a government-sponsored insurance plan   but they have not proposed single-payer. Clinton has consistently resisted going in that direction and instead proposes to work to prevent the repeal of Obamacare and try to improve on it.Pence s claim is Mostly False.Pence: Donald Trump  never said that  more nations should get nuclear weapons.Mostly False. Trump has said some countries, namely Japan and South Korea, might be  better off  if they were to develop nuclear weapons, given their proximity to North Korea. However, he has also said   often in the same interview   that he opposes nuclear proliferation in general.Pence:  We delivered $400 million in cash as a ransom payment for Americans held by the radical mullahs in Tehran.This  ransom  line, which we ve previously heard from Trump, is Mostly False. Iran received the payment on the same day that American prisoners were released, but experts said this was not ransom. The United States owed Iran the money as part of a decades-long financial dispute.Pence:  Less than 10 cents on the dollar in the Clinton Foundation has gone to charitable causes. This is a repeated Republican talking point and it s inaccurate. While it s true that the foundation gives away in grants a small fraction of its resources, about 87 percent of its expenses go toward services it provides directly.And that s just a few. The entire analysis of the truthfulness of the vice presidential candidates  claims can be found here at Politifact.Overall, Mike Pence had to walk a very difficult tight rope Tuesday night. While he might have won when it comes to a calm, cool style, he failed miserably on substance. Perhaps that is because when it comes down to it, his running mate is a racist, misogynist, pathological liar and a dangerous demagogue who should never be anywhere near the Oval Office. To that end, Pence s strategy seemed to be to insist that the more outrageous things that Donald Trump has said throughout this horrific travesty of a presidential campaign aren t true, and to run away from clearly indefensible positions. Or maybe he s just drank the Kool-Aid they regularly serve up at Trump Tower, and actually thinks he is telling the truth and being reasonable.Either way, it s insanity. Thank goodness for fact-checkers to help set the American people straight in this nightmare of a presidential election season.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"October 5, 2016",3741
"POWERFUL! HE BECAME A POLICE OFFICER AFTER Watching The Twin Towers Fall On 9-11…Today, He “Humbly Begs” Seahawks Players To Not Sit For National Anthem","Dallas Police Officer Dan Cincinnatus wrote an amazing letter to Seattle Seahawks player, Russell Wilson imploring him to not sit while the fans honor our flag during the playing of the National Anthem. The Seattle Seahawks team has apparently organized a team  sit-down  during the playing of the National Anthem as a way to protest black oppression in America. Many Americans, including us, believe this is truly the most disrespectful act of anti-americanism we have ever seen in professional sports and has nothing whatsoever to do with multi-millionair black athletes being oppressed by America. Read Dan s letter and tell us what you think in the comments below or on our Facebook page.From Dan Cincinnati s  Facebook page:In response to the rumors of a Seattle Seahawks team sit-down for the Star Spangled Banner on 09/11, I wrote this open letter to Russell Wilson and posted it on his Facebook page.Dear Mr. Wilson,My name is Dan Russell. I am a lifelong Seattle Seahawks fan, a native Washingtonian, and I have the humble privilege of serving as a Police Officer in my community.I am the Officer in these photos   two of which went viral   taken in Dallas on 07/07 at the scene where 14 police officers were shot in an ambush; five of whom perished from their injuries.I decided to dedicate myself to a life of Service on a Tuesday morning sitting in my parents living room on 09/11/2001, as I watched live footage of a plane crash into the World Trade Center. I woke up my brother, a serving United States Marine at the time, to give him the news   America was under attack.On that sunny and bright Tuesday, 2,996 Americans lost their lives. 343 of those lost were firefighters, and 71 were law enforcement officers. In response to the worst terrorist attack in our Nation s history, millions answered the call to Service   to Serve their Nation in the military, to Serve their communities as Police Officers, firefighters, dispatchers, paramedics, or as the family of one of these intrepid selfless individuals.Every day, more choose to answer the call to Serve   inspired by those events of fifteen years ago and the selfless sacrifice of so many that came before them.I chose to Serve on 09/11/2001. After Ferguson in 2014 I found myself questioning my choice of career and vocation. A visit to Ground Zero reminded me that I was Serving something bigger than myself   something beautiful and everlasting.America.I humbly ask   I beg   that you do not sit down for The Star Spangled Banner on this coming Sunday, the 15th anniversary of 09/11/2001.To do so would be a slap in the face to millions of fans, millions of public Servants, millions of Americans, to 09/11 first responders, to the survivors, and to the families of all that were involved and impacted by that terrible day, most of all   To those 2,996 who fell in an act of hatred towards our country and all we stand for.You have so many avenues of making a stand, of letting your voice be one of compassion, reconciliation, and building rather than tearing down. You have shown that you are an inspiring leader, man of community, faith, family, and charity. You have a voice that will be heard.Please, use your voice in one of those other avenues   do not allow yourself to become one that succumbs to the sensationalism and misguided choices that are currently causing so much division in our country.Stand for The Star Spangled Banner.We who Serve will stand with you.Respectfully, Dan Russell Seahawks FanRussell Wilson has announced that he will NOT take part in the planned  sit-down  by players on the Seattle Seahawks team. Here is his response.HERE is the link to Dan s letter on Facebook.We d like to offer Officer Cincinnatus a standing O for his well-written and powerful letter!",left-news,"Sep 10, 2016",3767
 WATCH: Joy Reid Shuts Down Right-Wing Pastor For Lying In Defense Of Racist Trump,"A pastor shamefully lied in defense of Donald Trump on Saturday and Joy Reid shut him down HARD.During an interview on MSNBC, conservative  Christian  pastor Darrell Scott, who is one of the few black people in America who support the Republican nominee, pretended that Trump is not a racist and denied that Trump had anything to do with the birther movement against President Obama.Trump tried to sell himself to black voters on Friday in front of an audience of white people by telling them they have  nothing to lose  by voting for him. That led Reid to ask,  If Donald Trump makes a speech to black people when there are none around to hear it, did he make a sound? Reid turned to Scott and noted that Trump has made two appeals to black voters in recent days in places where the black population only makes up about 1 percent of the total.  Why is he making those appeals in front of almost exclusively white audiences?  she asked.Scott made excuses for Trump, claiming that it doesn t matter where he speaks because all African-Americans hear him. When pressed on why Trump has not accepted invitations from the NAACP, the Urban League, and the National Association of Black Journalists because he supposedly had better things to do already on his schedule.Reid smiled as Scott called Trump  a cultural phenomenon  who draws rock star crowds. Reid then zinged back that those crowds are devoid of black people.Reid slammed Trump for pushing the false notion that every black person in America is living in poverty and going to failing schools and then asked Scott about Trump s history of housing discrimination, which has been cited by the Justice Department because the Republican nominee refused to rent to black people.Scott claimed that it was just an accusation and denied that Trump discriminated against black people, but the record shows that Trump settled the case with the government because there was a strong case against him, hardly the action of a man who didn t commit such an offense.Reid then asked Scott about Trump s prominent role in the birther movement. Despite multiple video tapes of Trump pushing the birther conspiracy and demanding President Obama s birth certificate, Scott also denied that Trump had anything to do with the movement. Don t tell me you agree with the bitherism, sir,  Reid pleaded.  Don t tell me you agree with that. Scott replied by claiming that Hillary Clinton started the birther movement, a notion that is totally false. And Reid shut Scott down for blatantly lying on her show. That s wrong. Even a pastor cannot make things up on this show,  she cautioned. I respect you as a pastor, but you re not going to come on and make things up. Here s the video via MSNBC.Donald Trump is desperately trying to save his flailing campaign and that s the only reason why he is making feeble attempts to court black voters now. If he really cared about black people he would have been courting them from the beginning. Instead, he has been palling around with white supremacists and encouraging violence against black protesters at his rallies. Scott can t sit there and call himself a man of God while lying through his teeth to defend a bloated racist. It s just not going to fly.Featured image via screenshot",News,"August 20, 2016",3258
PELOSI GIGGLES NERVOUSLY: “After I Met President Trump I Prayed For America” [Video],"Nancy Pelosi said in an interview with Joy Reid that after she met President Trump she  prayed for America She giggled nervously.

It s quite a delusional rant.How can the Democrats be taken seriously when they behave this way? Pelosi isn t the only one. Maxine Waters is a very close second in the wacky category.

 CPAC Cowards Run For The Hills As Milo Pedophilia Controversy Heats Up (IMAGES),"Conservatives once again show that their sense of  morality  is really only dependent upon which way the political tide is blowing. First, they had proudly defended their decision to invite Alt-Right (read: Neo-Nazi) darling Milo Yiannopoulos to the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) as a star speaker. Now, Milo has said MANY things that are reprehensible to any decent person, regardless of political leanings. He has been openly racist, misogynist, otherwise bigoted, and has just generally been an all around trolling degenerate. That was no secret. But still, he was A-OKAY with the good folks who run the right-wing s biggest event of the year.However, right-wingers are cowards. When things get too hot, they run away like cockroaches. That is what has happened now that Milo has been caught on tape advocating for and defending pederasty. Given the obvious and understandable public outcry here, the CPAC folks have dropped Milo like a hot rock. Right-wing mouthpiece and leading CPAC organizer Matt Schlap tweeted the following announcement regarding his newfound rejection of Milo:""@ACUConservative has decided to rescind the invitation of Milo Yiannopoulos to speak at #CPAC2017."" pic.twitter.com/sVWGnPCW7C  Matt Schlapp (@mschlapp) February 20, 2017Of course, Milo has put up his own super defensive Facebook post regarding the matter:This seems to be a bit too far for even some of his rabid fans, though. Here are just a few responses Milo received on that post: And that s just for starters. Unfortunately, there are a lot of blind defenders there as well, and others who are off on a tangent about how LGBTQ rights led to the sorts of views that Milo holds. Either way, Milo has gone way too far this time. The sad part is that he is now mainstream as far as conservatives go now. The Alt-Right IS the current face of the GOP under Donald Trump. It just took this revelation for the folks at CPAC to realize that   or rather, it took media attention and political pressure for them to care. Sad, but true.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"February 20, 2017",2080
PENTAGON REQUEST DENIED: [Video] ARMED CITIZENS DEFENDING RECRUITMENT CENTERS WON’T STAND DOWN,"Ordinary citizens (many of them are proud veterans) are filling a breach left by our federal government US Navy veteran Tim Keown has been standing guard outside a recruitment center in Kentucky for a week now.Tim made the decision to guard the local recruitment center after an Islamic terrorist murdered five servicemen in Chattanooga last week. Keown also helped organize other armed guards at recruitment centers across the country.Citizen guards protect a recruitment office after the Chattanooga terrorist attack.The Pentagon released a statement on Friday asking citizens not to stand guard at the unprotected recruiting offices. But the Pentagon has no plans on changing policy that forbids servicemen and women from carrying weapons at the centers. Evidently, five dead servicemen is not enough to force change in Pentagon policy.Tim Keown says his group will remain outside the recruitment offices until the US soldiers and Marines are protected: If our government is not going to protect these men and women, who is?  Who s going to protect these gentlemen and women if we don t?  All I m asking is why can t recruiters arm themselves and protect themselves? Via: Gateway Pundit",Government News,"Jul 25, 2015",1189
